# Book of Numbers 21 (RSVCE)

### The Bronze Serpent
1 When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the Negeb, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.
2 And Israel vowed a vow to theLord, and said, “If thou wilt indeed give this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.”
3 And theLordhearkened to the voice of Israel, and gave over the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities; so the name of the place was called Hormah.
4 From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient on the way.
5 And the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food.”
6 Then theLordsent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.
7 And the people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against theLordand against you; pray to theLord, that he take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.
8 And theLordsaid to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and every one who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.”
9 So Moses made a bronze serpent, and set it on a pole; and if a serpent bit any man, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.
### The Journey to Moab
10 And the people of Israel set out, and encamped in Oboth.
11 And they set out from Oboth, and encamped at Iʹye-abʹarim, in the wilderness which is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise.
12 From there they set out, and encamped in the Valley of Zered.
13 From there they set out, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the boundary of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
14 Wherefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of theLord, “Waheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon,
15 and the slope of the valleys that extends to the seat of Ar, and leans to the border of Moab.”
16 And from there they continued to Beer; that is the well of which theLordsaid to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.”
17 Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well!—Sing to it!—
18 the well which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people delved, with the scepter and with their staves.” And from the wilderness they went on to Matʹtanah,
19 and from Matʹtanah to Nahaʹliel, and from Nahaʹliel to Bamoth,
20 and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah which looks down upon the desert.
### King Sihon Defeated
21 Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
22 “Let me pass through your land; we will not turn aside into field or vineyard; we will not drink the water of a well; we will go by the King’s Highway, until we have passed through your territory.”
23 But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered all his men together, and went out against Israel to the wilderness, and came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
24 And Israel slew him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites; for Jazer was the boundary of the Ammonites.
25 And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon.
27 Therefore the ballad singers say, “Come to Heshbon, let it be built, let the city of Sihon be established.
28 For fire went forth from Heshbon, flame from the city of Sihon. It devoured Ar of Moab, the lords of the heights of the Arnon.
29 Woe to you, O Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh! He has made his sons fugitives, and his daughters captives, to an Amorite king, Sihon.
30 So their posterity perished from Heshbon, as far as Dibon, and we laid waste until fire spread to Medʹeba.”r
### King Og Defeated
31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
32 And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its villages, and dispossessed the Amorites that were there.
33 Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan came out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edʹre-i.
34 But theLordsaid to Moses, “Do not fear him; for I have given him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.”
35 So they slew him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was not one survivor left to him; and they possessed his land.


# Liber Numeri 21 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Quod cum audisset Chananæus rex Arad, qui habitabat ad meridiem, venisse scilicet Israël per exploratorum viam, pugnavit contra illum, et victor existens, duxit ex eo prædam.
2 At Israël voto se Domino obligans, ait: Si tradideris populum istum in manu mea, delebo urbes ejus.
3 Exaudivitque Dominus preces Israël, et tradidit Chananæum, quem ille interfecit subversis urbibus ejus: et vocavit nomen loci illius Horma, id est, anathema.

4 Profecti sunt autem et de monte Hor, per viam quæ ducit ad mare Rubrum, ut circumirent terram Edom. Et tædere cœpit populum itineris ac laboris:
5 locutusque contra Deum et Moysen, ait: Cur eduxisti nos de Ægypto, ut moreremur in solitudine? deest panis, non sunt aquæ: anima nostra jam nauseat super cibo isto levissimo.
6 Quam ob rem misit Dominus in populum ignitos serpentes, ad quorum plagas et mortes plurimorum,
7 venerunt ad Moysen, atque dixerunt: Peccavimus, quia locuti sumus contra Dominum et te: ora ut tollat a nobis serpentes. Oravitque Moyses pro populo,
8 et locutus est Dominus ad eum: Fac serpentem æneum, et pone eum pro signo: qui percussus aspexerit eum, vivet.
9 Fecit ergo Moyses serpentem æneum, et posuit eum pro signo: quem cum percussi aspicerent, sanabantur.

10 Profectique filii Israël castrametati sunt in Oboth.
11 Unde egressi fixere tentoria in Jeabarim, in solitudine quæ respicit Moab contra orientalem plagam.
12 Et inde moventes, venerunt ad torrentem Zared.
13 Quem relinquentes castrametati sunt contra Arnon, quæ est in deserto, et prominet in finibus Amorrhæi. Siquidem Arnon terminus est Moab, dividens Moabitas et Amorrhæos.
14 Unde dicitur in libro bellorum Domini:Sicut fecit in mari Rubro,sic faciet in torrentibus Arnon.
15 Scopuli torrentium inclinati sunt, ut requiescerent in Ar,et recumberent in finibus Moabitarum.
16 Ex eo loco apparuit puteus, super quo locutus est Dominus ad Moysen: Congrega populum, et dabo ei aquam.
17 Tunc cecinit Israël carmen istud:Ascendat puteus.Concinebant:
18 Puteus, quem foderunt principeset paraverunt duces multitudinisin datore legis, et in baculis suis.De solitudine, Matthana.
19 De Matthana in Nahaliel: de Nahaliel in Bamoth.
20 De Bamoth, vallis est in regione Moab, in vertice Phasga, quod respicit contra desertum.

21 Misit autem Israël nuntios ad Sehon regem Amorrhæorum, dicens:
22 Obsecro ut transire mihi liceat per terram tuam: non declinabimus in agros et vineas; non bibemus aquas ex puteis: via regia gradiemur, donec transeamus terminos tuos.
23 Qui concedere noluit ut transiret Israël per fines suos: quin potius exercitu congregato, egressus est obviam in desertum, et venit in Jasa, pugnavitque contra eum.
24 A quo percussus est in ore gladii, et possessa est terra ejus ab Arnon usque Jeboc, et filios Ammon: quia forti præsidio tenebantur termini Ammonitarum.
25 Tulit ergo Israël omnes civitates ejus, et habitavit in urbibus Amorrhæi, in Hesebon scilicet, et viculis ejus.
26 Urbs Hesebon fuit Sehon regis Amorrhæi, qui pugnavit contra regem Moab: et tulit omnem terram, quæ ditionis illius fuerat usque Arnon.

27 Idcirco dicitur in proverbio:Venite in Hesebon: ædificetur, et construatur civitas Sehon:
28 ignis egressus est de Hesebon, flamma de oppido Sehon,et devoravit Ar Moabitarum, et habitatores excelsorum Arnon.
29 Væ tibi Moab; peristi popule Chamos.Dedit filios ejus in fugam, et filias in captivitatem regi Amorrhæorum Sehon.
30 Jugum ipsorum disperiit ad Hesebon usque Dibon:lassi pervenerunt in Nophe, et usque Medaba.

31 Habitavit itaque Israël in terra Amorrhæi.
32 Misitque Moyses qui explorarent Jazer: cujus ceperunt viculos, et possederunt habitatores.
33 Verteruntque se, et ascenderunt per viam Basan, et occurrit eis Og, rex Basan, cum omni populo suo, pugnaturus in Edrai.
34 Dixitque Dominus ad Moysen: Ne timeas eum, quia in manu tua tradidi illum, et omnem populum ac terram ejus: faciesque illi sicut fecisti Sehon, regi Amorrhæorum habitatori Hesebon.
35 Percusserunt igitur et hunc cum filiis suis, universumque populum ejus usque ad internecionem, et possederunt terram illius.

1 καὶ ἤκουσεν ὁ Χανανις βασιλεὺς Αραδ ὁ κατοικῶν κατὰ τὴν ἔρημον ἦλθεν γὰρ Ισραηλ ὁδὸν Αθαριν καὶ ἐπολέμησεν πρὸς Ισραηλ καὶ κατεπρονόμευσαν ἐξ αὐτῶν αἰχμαλωσίαν

6 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν κύριος εἰς τὸν λαὸν τοὺς ὄφεις τοὺς θανατοῦντας καὶ ἔδακνον τὸν λαόν καὶ ἀπέθανεν λαὸς πολὺς τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ
7 καὶ παραγενόμενος ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Μωυσῆν ἔλεγον ὅτι ἡμάρτομεν ὅτι κατελαλήσαμεν κατὰ τοῦ κυρίου καὶ κατὰ σοῦ εὖξαι οὖν πρὸς κύριον καὶ ἀφελέτω ἀ{F'} ἡμῶν τὸν ὄφιν καὶ ηὔξατο Μωυσῆς πρὸς κύριον περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ

9 καὶ ἐποίησεν Μωυσῆς ὄφιν χαλκοῦν καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ σημείου καὶ ἐγένετο ὅταν ἔδακνεν ὄφις ἄνθρωπον καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ τὸν ὄφιν τὸν χαλκοῦν καὶ ἔζη

10 καὶ ἀπῆραν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν Ωβωθ
11 καὶ ἐξάραντες ἐξ Ωβωθ παρενέβαλον ἐν Αχελγαι ἐκ τοῦ πέραν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἥ ἐστιν κατὰ πρόσωπον Μωαβ κατὰ ἀνατολὰς ἡλίου

14 διὰ τοῦτο λέγεται ἐν βιβλίῳ πόλεμος τοῦ κυρίου τὴν Ζωοβ ἐφλόγισεν καὶ τοὺς χειμάρρους Αρνων
15 καὶ τοὺς χειμάρρους κατέστησεν κατοικίσαι Ηρ καὶ πρόσκειται τοῖς ὁρίοις Μωαβ
16 καὶ ἐκεῖθεν τὸ φρέαρ τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ φρέαρ ὃ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν συνάγαγε τὸν λαόν καὶ δώσω αὐτοῖς ὕδωρ πιεῖν

21 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Μωυσῆς πρέσβεις πρὸς Σηων βασιλέα Αμορραίων λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς λέγων
22 παρελευσόμεθα διὰ τῆς γῆς σου τῇ ὁδῷ πορευσόμεθα οὐκ ἐκκλινοῦμεν οὔτε εἰς ἀγρὸν οὔτε εἰς ἀμπελῶνα οὐ πιόμεθα ὕδωρ ἐκ φρέατός σου ὁδῷ βασιλικῇ πορευσόμεθα ἕως παρέλθωμεν τὰ ὅριά σου
23 καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκεν Σηων τῷ Ισραηλ παρελθεῖν διὰ τῶν ὁρίων αὐτοῦ καὶ συνήγαγεν Σηων πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν παρατάξασθαι τῷ Ισραηλ εἰς τὴν ἔρημον καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Ιασσα καὶ παρετάξατο τῷ Ισραηλ
24 καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν Ισραηλ φόνῳ μαχαίρης καὶ κατεκυρίευσαν τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ Αρνων ἕως Ιαβοκ ἕως υἱῶν Αμμαν ὅτι Ιαζηρ ὅρια υἱῶν Αμμων ἐστίν
25 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ισραηλ πάσας τὰς πόλεις ταύτας καὶ κατῴκησεν Ισραηλ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσιν τῶν Αμορραίων ἐν Εσεβων καὶ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς συγκυρούσαις αὐτῇ
26 ἔστιν γὰρ Εσεβων πόλις Σηων τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν Αμορραίων καὶ οὗτος ἐπολέμησεν βασιλέα Μωαβ τὸ πρότερον καὶ ἔλαβον πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ Αροηρ ἕως Αρνων
