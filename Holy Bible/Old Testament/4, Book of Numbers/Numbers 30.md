### Vows Made by Women
1 Moses said to the heads of the tribes of the people of Israel, “This is what theLordhas commanded.
2 When a man vows a vow to theLord, or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
3 Or when a woman vows a vow to theLord, and binds herself by a pledge, while within her father’s house, in her youth,
4 and her father hears of her vow and of her pledge by which she has bound herself, and says nothing to her; then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge by which she has bound herself shall stand.
5 But if her father expresses disapproval to her on the day that he hears of it, no vow of hers, no pledge by which she has bound herself, shall stand; and theLordwill forgive her, because her father opposed her.
6 And if she is married to a husband, while under her vows or any thoughtless utterance of her lips by which she has bound herself,
7 and her husband hears of it, and says nothing to her on the day that he hears; then her vows shall stand, and her pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand.
8 But if, on the day that her husband comes to hear of it, he expresses disapproval, then he shall make void her vow which was on her, and the thoughtless utterance of her lips, by which she bound herself; and theLordwill forgive her.
9 But any vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, anything by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her.
10 And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound herself by a pledge with an oath,
11 and her husband heard of it, and said nothing to her, and did not oppose her; then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge by which she bound herself shall stand.
12 But if her husband makes them null and void on the day that he hears them, then whatever proceeds out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning her pledge of herself, shall not stand: her husband has made them void, and theLordwill forgive her.
13 Any vow and any binding oath to afflict herself, her husband may establish, or her husband may make void.
14 But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her pledges, that are upon her; he has established them, because he said nothing to her on the day that he heard of them.
15 But if he makes them null and void after he has heard of them, then he shall bear her iniquity.”
16 These are the statutes which theLordcommanded Moses, as between a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter, while in her youth, within her father’s house.


# Liber Numeri 30 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Narravitque Moyses filiis Israël omnia quæ ei Dominus imperarat.
2 Et locutus est ad principes tribuum filiorum Israël: Iste est sermo quem præcepit Dominus:
3 Si quis virorum votum Domino voverit, aut se constrinxerit juramento: non faciet irritum verbum suum, sed omne quod promisit, implebit.
4 Mulier si quippiam voverit, et se constrinxerit juramento, quæ est in domo patris sui, et in ætate adhuc puellari: si cognoverit pater votum quod pollicita est, et juramentum quo obligavit animam suam, et tacuerit, voti rea erit:
5 quidquid pollicita est, et juravit, opere complebit.
6 Sin autem statim ut audierit, contradixerit pater: et vota et juramenta ejus irrita erunt, nec obnoxia tenebitur sponsioni, eo quod contradixerit pater.
7 Si maritum habuerit, et voverit aliquid, et semel de ore ejus verbum egrediens animam ejus obligaverit juramento:
8 quo die audierit vir, et non contradixerit, voti rea erit, reddetque quodcumque promiserat.
9 Sin autem audiens statim contradixerit, et irritas fecerit pollicitationes ejus, verbaque quibus obstrinxerat animam suam, propitius erit ei Dominus.
10 Vidua et repudiata quidquid voverint, reddent.
11 Uxor in domo viri cum se voto constrinxerit et juramento,
12 si audierit vir, et tacuerit, nec contradixerit sponsioni, reddet quodcumque promiserat.
13 Sin autem extemplo contradixerit, non tenebitur promissionis rea: quia maritus contradixit, et Dominus ei propitius erit.

14 Si voverit, et juramento se constrinxerit, ut per jejunium, vel ceterarum rerum abstinentiam affligat animam suam, in arbitrio viri erit ut faciat, sive non faciat.
15 Quod si audiens vir tacuerit, et in alteram diem distulerit sententiam, quidquid voverat atque promiserat, reddet: quia statim ut audivit, tacuit.
16 Sin autem contradixerit postquam rescivit, portabit ipse iniquitatem ejus.

17 Istæ sunt leges, quas constituit Dominus Moysi inter virum et uxorem, inter patrem et filiam, quæ in puellari adhuc ætate est, vel quæ manet in parentis domo.
