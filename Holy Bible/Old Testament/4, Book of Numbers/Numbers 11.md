# Book of Numbers 11 (RSVCE)

### Complaining in the Desert
1 And the people complained in the hearing of theLordabout their misfortunes; and when theLordheard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of theLordburned among them, and consumed some outlying parts of the camp.
2 Then the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to theLord, and the fire abated.
3 So the name of that place was called Tabʹerah, because the fire of theLordburned among them.
4 Now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving; and the people of Israel also wept again, and said, “O that we had meat to eat!
5 We remember the fish we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;
6 but now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.”
7 Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.
8 The people went about and gathered it, and ground it in mills or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.
9 When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.
10 Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of theLordblazed hotly, and Moses was displeased.
11 Moses said to theLord, “Why hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? And why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou dost lay the burden of all this people upon me?
12 Did I conceive all this people? Did I bring them forth, that thou shouldst say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries the sucking child,’ to the land which thou didst swear to give their fathers?
13 Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’
14 I am not able to carry all this people alone, the burden is too heavy for me.
15 If thou wilt deal thus with me, kill me at once, if I find favor in thy sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.”
### The Seventy Elders
16 And theLordsaid to Moses, “Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you.
17 And I will come down and talk with you there; and I will take some of the spirit which is upon you and put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone.
18 And say to the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the hearing of theLord, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.” Therefore theLordwill give you meat, and you shall eat.
19 You shall not eat one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,
20 but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected theLordwho is among you, and have wept before him, saying, “Why did we come forth out of Egypt?” ’ ”
21 But Moses said, “The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot; and thou hast said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!’
22 Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?”
23 And theLordsaid to Moses, “Is theLord’s hand shortened? Now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not.”
24 So Moses went out and told the people the words of theLord; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and placed them round about the tent.
25 Then theLordcame down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the spirit that was upon him and put it upon the seventy elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did so no more.
26 Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the spirit rested upon them; they were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.
27 And a young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, said, “My lord Moses, forbid them.”
29 But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all theLord’s people were prophets, that theLordwould put his spirit upon them!”
30 And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
### The Quails
31 And there went forth a wind from theLord, and it brought quails from the sea, and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.
32 And the people rose all that day, and all night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails; he who gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
33 While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of theLordwas kindled against the people, and theLordsmote the people with a very great plague.
34 Therefore the name of that place was called Kibʹroth-hattaʹavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving.
35 From Kibʹroth-hattaʹavah the people journeyed to Hazeʹroth; and they remained at Hazeʹroth.


# Liber Numeri 11 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Interea ortum est murmur populi, quasi dolentium pro labore, contra Dominum. Quod cum audisset Dominus, iratus est. Et accensus in eos ignis Domini, devoravit extremam castrorum partem.
2 Cumque clamasset populus ad Moysen, oravit Moyses ad Dominum, et absorptus est ignis.
3 Vocavitque nomen loci illius, Incensio: eo quod incensus fuisset contra eos ignis Domini.

4 Vulgus quippe promiscuum, quod ascenderat cum eis, flagravit desiderio, sedens et flens, junctis sibi pariter filiis Israël, et ait: Quis dabit nobis ad vescendum carnes?
5 recordamur piscium quos comedebamus in Ægypto gratis: in mentem nobis veniunt cucumeres, et pepones, porrique, et cæpe, et allia.
6 Anima nostra arida est: nihil aliud respiciunt oculi nostri nisi man.
7 Erat autem man quasi semen coriandri, coloris bdellii.
8 Circuibatque populus, et colligens illud, frangebat mola, sive terebat in mortario, coquens in olla, et faciens ex eo tortulas saporis quasi panis oleati.
9 Cumque descenderet nocte super castra ros, descendebat pariter et man.

10 Audivit ergo Moyses flentem populum per familias, singulos per ostia tentorii sui. Iratusque est furor Domini valde: sed et Moysi intoleranda res visa est,
11 et ait ad Dominum: Cur afflixisti servum tuum? quare non invenio gratiam coram te? et cur imposuisti pondus universi populi hujus super me?
12 Numquid ego concepi omnem hanc multitudinem, vel genui eam, ut dicas mihi: Porta eos in sinu tuo sicut portare solet nutrix infantulum, et defer in terram, pro qua jurasti patribus eorum?
13 Unde mihi carnes ut dem tantæ multitudini? flent contra me, dicentes: Da nobis carnes ut comedamus.
14 Non possum solus sustinere omnem hunc populum, quia gravis est mihi.
15 Sin aliter tibi videtur, obsecro ut interficias me, et inveniam gratiam in oculis tuis, ne tantis afficiar malis.

16 Et dixit Dominus ad Moysen: Congrega mihi septuaginta viros de senibus Israël, quos tu nosti quod senes populi sint ac magistri: et duces eos ad ostium tabernaculi fœderis, faciesque ibi stare tecum,
17 ut descendam et loquar tibi: et auferam de spiritu tuo, tradamque eis, ut sustentent tecum onus populi, et non tu solus graveris.
18 Populo quoque dices: Sanctificamini (cras comedetis carnes: ego enim audivi vos dicere: Quis dabit nobis escas carnium? bene nobis erat in Ægypto), ut det vobis Dominus carnes, et comedatis:
19 non uno die, nec duobus, vel quinque aut decem, nec viginti quidem,
20 sed usque ad mensem dierum, donec exeat per nares vestras, et vertatur in nauseam, eo quod repuleritis Dominum, qui in medio vestri est, et fleveritis coram eo, dicentes: Quare egressi sumus ex Ægypto?
21 Et ait Moyses: Sexcenta millia peditum hujus populi sunt: et tu dicis: Dabo eis esum carnium mense integro?
22 numquid ovium et boum multitudo cædetur, ut possit sufficere ad cibum? vel omnes pisces maris in unum congregabuntur, ut eos satient?
23 Cui respondit Dominus: Numquid manus Domini invalida est? jam nunc videbis utrum meus sermo opere compleatur.

24 Venit igitur Moyses, et narravit populo verba Domini, congregans septuaginta viros de senibus Israël, quos stare fecit circa tabernaculum.
25 Descenditque Dominus per nubem, et locutus est ad eum, auferens de spiritu qui erat in Moyse, et dans septuaginta viris. Cumque requievisset in eis spiritus, prophetaverunt, nec ultra cessaverunt.
26 Remanserat autem in castris duo viri, quorum unus vocabatur Eldad, et alter Medad, super quos requievit spiritus. Nam et ipsi descripti fuerant, et non exierant ad tabernaculum.
27 Cumque prophetarent in castris, cucurrit puer, et nuntiavit Moysi, dicens: Eldad et Medad prophetant in castris.
28 Statim Josue filius Nun, minister Moysi, et electus e pluribus, ait: Domine mi Moyses, prohibe eos.
29 At ille: Quid, inquit æmularis pro me? quis tribuat ut omnis populus prophetet, et det eis Dominus spiritum suum?
30 Reversusque est Moyses, et majores natu Israël in castra.

31 Ventus autem egrediens a Domino, arreptans trans mare coturnices detulit, et demisit in castra itinere quantum uno die confici potest, ex omni parte castrorum per circuitum, volabantque in aëre duobus cubitis altitudine super terram.
32 Surgens ergo populus toto die illo, et nocte, ac die altero, congregavit coturnicum: qui parum, decem coros: et siccaverunt eas per gyrum castrorum.
33 Adhuc carnes erant in dentibus eorum, nec defecerat hujuscemodi cibus: et ecce furor Domini concitatus in populum, percussit eum plaga magna nimis.
34 Vocatusque est ille locus, Sepulchra concupiscentiæ: ibi enim sepelierunt populum qui desideraverat.
35 Egressi autem de Sepulchris concupiscentiæ, venerunt in Haseroth, et manserunt ibi.

6 νυνὶ δὲ ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν κατάξηρος οὐδὲν πλὴν εἰς τὸ μαννα οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν
7 τὸ δὲ μαννα ὡσεὶ σπέρμα κορίου ἐστίν καὶ τὸ εἶδος αὐτοῦ εἶδος κρυστάλλου
8 καὶ διεπορεύετο ὁ λαὸς καὶ συνέλεγον καὶ ἤληθον αὐτὸ ἐν τῷ μύλῳ καὶ ἔτριβον ἐν τῇ θυίᾳ καὶ ἥψουν αὐτὸ ἐν τῇ χύτρᾳ καὶ ἐποίουν αὐτὸ ἐγκρυφίας καὶ ἦν ἡ ἡδονὴ αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ γεῦμα ἐγκρὶς ἐξ ἐλαίου
9 καὶ ὅταν κατέβη ἡ δρόσος ἐπὶ τὴν παρεμβολὴν νυκτός κατέβαινεν τὸ μαννα ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς

10 καὶ ἤκουσεν Μωυσῆς κλαιόντων αὐτῶν κατὰ δήμους αὐτῶν ἕκαστον ἐπὶ τῆς θύρας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ κύριος σφόδρα καὶ ἔναντι Μωυσῆ ἦν πονηρόν
11 καὶ εἶπεν Μωυσῆς πρὸς κύριον ἵνα τί ἐκάκωσας τὸν θεράποντά σου καὶ διὰ τί οὐχ εὕρηκα χάριν ἐναντίον σου ἐπιθεῖναι τὴν ὁρμὴν τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου ἐ{P'} ἐμέ
12 μὴ ἐγὼ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔλαβον πάντα τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον ἢ ἐγὼ ἔτεκον αὐτούς ὅτι λέγεις μοι λαβὲ αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν κόλπον σου ὡσεὶ ἄραι τιθηνὸς τὸν θηλάζοντα εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ὤμοσας τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν
13 πόθεν μοι κρέα δοῦναι παντὶ τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ ὅτι κλαίουσιν ἐ{P'} ἐμοὶ λέγοντες δὸς ἡμῖν κρέα ἵνα φάγωμεν

15 εἰ δὲ οὕτως σὺ ποιεῖς μοι ἀπόκτεινόν με ἀναιρέσει εἰ εὕρηκα ἔλεος παρὰ σοί ἵνα μὴ ἴδω μου τὴν κάκωσιν

16 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν συνάγαγέ μοι ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρας ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων Ισραηλ οὓς αὐτὸς σὺ οἶδας ὅτι οὗτοί εἰσιν πρεσβύτεροι τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ γραμματεῖς αὐτῶν καὶ ἄξεις αὐτοὺς πρὸς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου καὶ στήσονται ἐκεῖ μετὰ σοῦ
17 καὶ καταβήσομαι καὶ λαλήσω ἐκεῖ μετὰ σοῦ καὶ ἀφελῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματος τοῦ ἐπὶ σοὶ καὶ ἐπιθήσω ἐ{P'} αὐτούς καὶ συναντιλήμψονται μετὰ σοῦ τὴν ὁρμὴν τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ οὐκ οἴσεις αὐτοὺς σὺ μόνος
18 καὶ τῷ λαῷ ἐρεῖς ἁγνίσασθε εἰς αὔριον καὶ φάγεσθε κρέα ὅτι ἐκλαύσατε ἔναντι κυρίου λέγοντες τίς ἡμᾶς ψωμιεῖ κρέα ὅτι καλὸν ἡμῖν ἐστιν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ δώσει κύριος ὑμῖν κρέα φαγεῖν καὶ φάγεσθε κρέα
19 οὐχ ἡμέραν μίαν φάγεσθε οὐδὲ δύο οὐδὲ πέντε ἡμέρας οὐδὲ δέκα ἡμέρας οὐδὲ εἴκοσι ἡμέρας

25 καὶ κατέβη κύριος ἐν νεφέλῃ καὶ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ παρείλατο ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματος τοῦ ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρας τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὡς δὲ ἐπανεπαύσατο τὸ πνεῦμα ἐ{P'} αὐτούς καὶ ἐπροφήτευσαν καὶ οὐκέτι προσέθεντο

27 καὶ προσδραμὼν ὁ νεανίσκος ἀπήγγειλεν Μωυσῇ καὶ εἶπεν λέγων Ελδαδ καὶ Μωδαδ προφητεύουσιν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ
28 καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ναυη ὁ παρεστηκὼς Μωυσῇ ὁ ἐκελεκτὸς εἶπεν κύριε Μωυσῆ κώλυσον αὐτούς
29 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Μωυσῆς μὴ ζηλοῖς σύ μοι καὶ τίς δῴη πάντα τὸν λαὸν κυρίου προφήτας ὅταν δῷ κύριος τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
30 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Μωυσῆς εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ισραηλ

31 καὶ πνεῦμα ἐξῆλθεν παρὰ κυρίου καὶ ἐξεπέρασεν ὀρτυγομήτραν ἀπὸ τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ ἐπέβαλεν ἐπὶ τὴν παρεμβολὴν ὁδὸν ἡμέρας ἐντεῦθεν καὶ ὁδὸν ἡμέρας ἐντεῦθεν κύκλῳ τῆς παρεμβολῆς ὡσεὶ δίπηχυ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς
32 καὶ ἀναστὰς ὁ λαὸς ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν καὶ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα καὶ ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν τὴν ἐπαύριον καὶ συνήγαγον τὴν ὀρτυγομήτραν ὁ τὸ ὀλίγον συνήγαγεν δέκα κόρους καὶ ἔψυξαν ἑαυτοῖς ψυγμοὺς κύκλῳ τῆς παρεμβολῆς
33 τὰ κρέα ἔτι ἦν ἐν τοῖς ὀδοῦσιν αὐτῶν πρὶν ἢ ἐκλείπειν καὶ κύριος ἐθυμώθη εἰς τὸν λαόν καὶ ἐπάταξεν κύριος τὸν λαὸν πληγὴν μεγάλην σφόδρα
34 καὶ ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου μνήματα τῆς ἐπιθυμίας ὅτι ἐκεῖ ἔθαψαν τὸν λαὸν τὸν ἐπιθυμητήν
35 ἀπὸ μνημάτων ἐπιθυμίας ἐξῆρεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς Ασηρωθ καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ λαὸς ἐν Ασηρωθ
