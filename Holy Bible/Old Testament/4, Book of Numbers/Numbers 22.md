### Balak Summons Balaam to Curse Israel
1 Then the people of Israel set out, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
3 And Moab was in great dread of the people, because they were many; Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel.
4 And Moab said to the elders of Midʹian, “This horde will now lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” So Balak the son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,
5 sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beʹor at Pethor, which is near the River, in the land of Amaw to call him, saying, “Behold, a people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the earth, and they are dwelling opposite me.
6 Come now, curse this people for me, since they are too mighty for me; perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”
7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midʹian departed with the fees for divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and gave him Balak’s message.
8 And he said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring back word to you, as theLordspeaks to me”; so the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
9 And God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”
10 And Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,
11 ‘Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and it covers the face of the earth; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out.’ ”
12 God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”
13 So Balaam rose in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your own land; for theLordhas refused to let me go with you.”
14 So the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”
15 Once again Balak sent princes, more in number and more honorable than they.
16 And they came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: ‘Let nothing hinder you from coming to me;
17 for I will surely do you great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do; come, curse this people for me.’ ”
18 But Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, “Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of theLordmy God, to do less or more.
19 Pray, now, tarry here this night also, that I may know what more theLordwill say to me.”
20 And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise, go with them; but only what I bid you, that shall you do.”
### Balaam, the Donkey, and the Angel
21 So Balaam rose in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
22 But God’s anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of theLordtook his stand in the way as his adversary. Now he was riding on the ass, and his two servants were with him.
23 And the ass saw the angel of theLordstanding in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the road, and went into the field; and Balaam struck the ass, to turn her into the road.
24 Then the angel of theLordstood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on either side.
25 And when the ass saw the angel of theLord, she pushed against the wall, and pressed Balaam’s foot against the wall; so he struck her again.
26 Then the angel of theLordwent ahead, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.
27 When the ass saw the angel of theLord, she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he struck the ass with his staff.
28 Then theLordopened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”
29 And Balaam said to the ass, “Because you have made sport of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you.”
30 And the ass said to Balaam, “Am I not your ass, upon which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever accustomed to do so to you?” And he said, “No.”
31 Then theLordopened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of theLordstanding in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
32 And the angel of theLordsaid to him, “Why have you struck your ass these three times? Behold, I have come forth to withstand you, because your way is perverse before me;
33 and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely just now I would have slain you and let her live.”
34 Then Balaam said to the angel of theLord, “I have sinned, for I did not know that thou didst stand in the road against me. Now therefore, if it is evil in thy sight, I will go back again.”
35 And the angel of theLordsaid to Balaam, “Go with the men; but only the word which I bid you, that shall you speak.” So Balaam went on with the princes of Balak.
36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, on the boundary formed by the Arnon, at the extremity of the boundary.
37 And Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?”
38 Balaam said to Balak, “Lo, I have come to you! Have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that must I speak.”
39 Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirʹiath-huʹzoth.
40 And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam and to the princes who were with him.
### Balaam’s First Oracle
41 And on the morrow Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamothbaʹal; and from there he saw the nearest of the people.


# Liber Numeri 22 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Profectique castrametati sunt in campestribus Moab, ubi trans Jordanem Jericho sita est.

2 Videns autem Balac filius Sephor omnia quæ fecerat Israël Amorrhæo,
3 et quod pertimuissent eum Moabitæ, et impetum ejus ferre non possent,
4 dixit ad majores natu Madian: Ita delebit hic populus omnes, qui in nostris finibus commorantur, quomodo solet bos herbas usque ad radices carpere. Ipse erat eo tempore rex in Moab.
5 Misit ergo nuntios ad Balaam filium Beor ariolum, qui habitabat super flumen terræ filiorum Ammon, ut vocarent eum, et dicerent: Ecce egressus est populus ex Ægypto, qui operuit superficiem terræ, sedens contra me.
6 Veni igitur, et maledic populo huic, quia fortior me est: si quomodo possim percutere et ejicere eum de terra mea. Novi enim quod benedictus sit cui benedixeris, et maledictus in quem maledicta congesseris.

7 Perrexeruntque seniores Moab, et majores natu Madian, habentes divinationis pretium in manibus. Cumque venissent ad Balaam, et narrassent ei omnia verba Balac,
8 ille respondit: Manete hic nocte, et respondebo quidquid mihi dixerit Dominus. Manentibus illis apud Balaam, venit Deus, et ait ad eum:
9 Quid sibi volunt homines isti apud te?
10 Respondit: Balac filius Sephor rex Moabitarum misit ad me,
11 dicens: Ecce populus qui egressus est de Ægypto, operuit superficiem terræ: veni, et maledic ei, si quomodo possim pugnans abigere eum.
12 Dixitque Deus ad Balaam: Noli ire cum eis, neque maledicas populo: quia benedictus est.
13 Qui mane consurgens dixit ad principes: Ite in terram vestram, quia prohibuit me Dominus venire vobiscum.
14 Reversi principes dixerunt ad Balac: Noluit Balaam venire nobiscum.
15 Rursum ille multo plures et nobiliores quam ante miserat, misit.
16 Qui cum venissent ad Balaam, dixerunt: Sic dicit Balac filius Sephor: Ne cuncteris venire ad me:
17 paratus sum honorare te, et quidquid volueris, dabo tibi: veni, et maledic populo isti.
18 Respondit Balaam: Si dederit mihi Balac plenam domum suam argenti et auri, non potero immutare verbum Domini Dei mei, ut vel plus, vel minus loquar.
19 Obsecro ut hic maneatis etiam hac nocte, et scire queam quid mihi rursum respondeat Dominus.
20 Venit ergo Deus ad Balaam nocte, et ait ei: Si vocare te venerunt homines isti, surge, et vade cum eis: ita dumtaxat, ut quod tibi præcepero, facias.

21 Surrexit Balaam mane, et strata asina sua profectus est cum eis.
22 Et iratus est Deus. Stetitque angelus Domini in via contra Balaam, qui insidebat asinæ, et duos pueros habebat secum.
23 Cernens asina angelum stantem in via, evaginato gladio, avertit se de itinere, et ibat per agrum. Quam cum verberaret Balaam, et vellet ad semitam reducere,
24 stetit angelus in angustiis duarum maceriarum, quibus vineæ cingebantur.
25 Quem videns asina, junxit se parieti, et attrivit sedentis pedem. At ille iterum verberabat eam:
26 et nihilominus angelus ad locum angustum transiens, ubi nec ad dexteram, nec ad sinistram poterat deviare, obvius stetit.
27 Cumque vidisset asina stantem angelum, concidit sub pedibus sedentis: qui iratus, vehementius cædebat fuste latera ejus.
28 Aperuitque Dominus os asinæ, et locuta est: Quid feci tibi? cur percutis me ecce jam tertio?
29 Respondit Balaam: Quia commeruisti, et illusisti mihi: utinam haberem gladium, ut te percuterem!
30 Dixit asina: Nonne animal tuum sum, cui semper sedere consuevisti usque in præsentem diem? dic quid simile umquam fecerim tibi. At ille ait: Numquam.
31 Protinus aperuit Dominus oculos Balaam, et vidit angelum stantem in via, evaginato gladio, adoravitque eum pronus in terram.

32 Cui angelus: Cur, inquit, tertio verberas asinam tuam? ego veni ut adversarer tibi, quia perversa est via tua, mihique contraria:
33 et nisi asina declinasset de via, dans locum resistenti, te occidissem, et illa viveret.
34 Dixit Balaam: Peccavi, nesciens quod tu stares contra me: et nunc si displicet tibi ut vadam, revertar.
35 Ait angelus: Vade cum istis, et cave ne aliud quam præcepero tibi loquaris. Ivit igitur cum principibus.
36 Quod cum audisset Balac, egressus est in occursum ejus in oppido Moabitarum, quod situm est in extremis finibus Arnon.
37 Dixitque ad Balaam: Misi nuntios ut vocarent te: cur non statim venisti ad me? an quia mercedem adventui tuo reddere nequeo?
38 Cui ille respondit: Ecce adsum: numquid loqui potero aliud, nisi quod Deus posuerit in ore meo?
39 Perrexerunt ergo simul, et venerunt in urbem, quæ in extremis regni ejus finibus erat.
40 Cumque occidisset Balac boves et oves, misit ad Balaam, et principes qui cum eo erant, munera.
41 Mane autem facto, duxit eum ad excelsa Baal, et intuitus est extremam partem populi.

7 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἡ γερουσία Μωαβ καὶ ἡ γερουσία Μαδιαμ καὶ τὰ μαντεῖα ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς Βαλααμ καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ τὰ ῥήματα Βαλακ

9 καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ θεὸς πρὸς Βαλααμ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τί οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὗτοι παρὰ σοί
10 καὶ εἶπεν Βαλααμ πρὸς τὸν θεόν Βαλακ υἱὸς Σεπφωρ βασιλεὺς Μωαβ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς πρός με λέγων
11 ἰδοὺ λαὸς ἐξελήλυθεν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἰδοὺ κεκάλυφεν τὴν ὄψιν τῆς γῆς καὶ οὗτος ἐγκάθηται ἐχόμενός μου καὶ νῦν δεῦρο ἄρασαί μοι αὐτόν εἰ ἄρα δυνήσομαι πατάξαι αὐτὸν καὶ ἐκβαλῶ αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς
12 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεὸς πρὸς Βαλααμ οὐ πορεύσῃ με{T'} αὐτῶν οὐδὲ καταράσῃ τὸν λαόν ἔστιν γὰρ εὐλογημένος
13 καὶ ἀναστὰς Βαλααμ τὸ πρωὶ εἶπεν τοῖς ἄρχουσιν Βαλακ ἀποτρέχετε πρὸς τὸν κύριον ὑμῶν οὐκ ἀφίησίν με ὁ θεὸς πορεύεσθαι με{Q'} ὑμῶν
14 καὶ ἀναστάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες Μωαβ ἦλθον πρὸς Βαλακ καὶ εἶπαν οὐ θέλει Βαλααμ πορευθῆναι με{Q'} ἡμῶν
15 καὶ προσέθετο Βαλακ ἔτι ἀποστεῖλαι ἄρχοντας πλείους καὶ ἐντιμοτέρους τούτων
16 καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς Βαλααμ καὶ λέγουσιν αὐτῷ τάδε λέγει Βαλακ ὁ τοῦ Σεπφωρ ἀξιῶ σε μὴ ὀκνήσῃς ἐλθεῖν πρός με
17 ἐντίμως γὰρ τιμήσω σε καὶ ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃς ποιήσω σοι καὶ δεῦρο ἐπικατάρασαί μοι τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον
18 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Βαλααμ καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς ἄρχουσιν Βαλακ ἐὰν δῷ μοι Βαλακ πλήρη τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου οὐ δυνήσομαι παραβῆναι τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτὸ μικρὸν ἢ μέγα ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ μου
19 καὶ νῦν ὑπομείνατε αὐτοῦ καὶ ὑμεῖς τὴν νύκτα ταύτην καὶ γνώσομαι τί προσθήσει κύριος λαλῆσαι πρός με
20 καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ θεὸς πρὸς Βαλααμ νυκτὸς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ εἰ καλέσαι σε πάρεισιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὗτοι ἀναστὰς ἀκολούθησον αὐτοῖς ἀλλὰ τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἂν λαλήσω πρὸς σέ τοῦτο ποιήσεις

21 καὶ ἀναστὰς Βαλααμ τὸ πρωὶ ἐπέσαξεν τὴν ὄνον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπορεύθη μετὰ τῶν ἀρχόντων Μωαβ
22 καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ ὁ θεὸς ὅτι ἐπορεύθη αὐτός καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐνδιαβάλλειν αὐτόν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπιβεβήκει ἐπὶ τῆς ὄνου αὐτοῦ καὶ δύο παῖδες αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ
23 καὶ ἰδοῦσα ἡ ὄνος τὸν ἄγγελον τοῦ θεοῦ ἀνθεστηκότα ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ τὴν ῥομφαίαν ἐσπασμένην ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξέκλινεν ἡ ὄνος ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ καὶ ἐπορεύετο εἰς τὸ πεδίον καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὴν ὄνον τῇ ῥάβδῳ τοῦ εὐθῦναι αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ
24 καὶ ἔστη ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν ταῖς αὔλαξιν τῶν ἀμπέλων φραγμὸς ἐντεῦθεν καὶ φραγμὸς ἐντεῦθεν
25 καὶ ἰδοῦσα ἡ ὄνος τὸν ἄγγελον τοῦ θεοῦ προσέθλιψεν ἑαυτὴν πρὸς τὸν τοῖχον καὶ ἀπέθλιψεν τὸν πόδα Βαλααμ καὶ προσέθετο ἔτι μαστίξαι αὐτήν
26 καὶ προσέθετο ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἀπελθὼν ὑπέστη ἐν τόπῳ στενῷ εἰς ὃν οὐκ ἦν ἐκκλῖναι δεξιὰν οὐδὲ ἀριστεράν
27 καὶ ἰδοῦσα ἡ ὄνος τὸν ἄγγελον τοῦ θεοῦ συνεκάθισεν ὑποκάτω Βαλααμ καὶ ἐθυμώθη Βαλααμ καὶ ἔτυπτεν τὴν ὄνον τῇ ῥάβδῳ
28 καὶ ἤνοιξεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ στόμα τῆς ὄνου καὶ λέγει τῷ Βαλααμ τί ἐποίησά σοι ὅτι πέπαικάς με τοῦτο τρίτον
29 καὶ εἶπεν Βαλααμ τῇ ὄνῳ ὅτι ἐμπέπαιχάς μοι καὶ εἰ εἶχον μάχαιραν ἐν τῇ χειρί μου ἤδη ἂν ἐξεκέντησά σε
30 καὶ λέγει ἡ ὄνος τῷ Βαλααμ οὐκ ἐγὼ ἡ ὄνος σου ἐ{F'} ἧς ἐπέβαινες ἀπὸ νεότητός σου ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας μὴ ὑπεροράσει ὑπεριδοῦσα ἐποίησά σοι οὕτως ὁ δὲ εἶπεν οὐχί

32 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ διὰ τί ἐπάταξας τὴν ὄνον σου τοῦτο τρίτον καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξῆλθον εἰς διαβολήν σου ὅτι οὐκ ἀστεία ἡ ὁδός σου ἐναντίον μου
33 καὶ ἰδοῦσά με ἡ ὄνος ἐξέκλινεν ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ τρίτον τοῦτο καὶ εἰ μὴ ἐξέκλινεν νῦν οὖν σὲ μὲν ἀπέκτεινα ἐκείνην δὲ περιεποιησάμην
34 καὶ εἶπεν Βαλααμ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ κυρίου ἡμάρτηκα οὐ γὰρ ἠπιστάμην ὅτι σύ μοι ἀνθέστηκας ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ εἰς συνάντησιν καὶ νῦν εἰ μή σοι ἀρέσκει ἀποστραφήσομαι
35 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ πρὸς Βαλααμ συμπορεύθητι μετὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων πλὴν τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐὰν εἴπω πρὸς σέ τοῦτο φυλάξῃ λαλῆσαι καὶ ἐπορεύθη Βαλααμ μετὰ τῶν ἀρχόντων Βαλακ
36 καὶ ἀκούσας Βαλακ ὅτι ἥκει Βαλααμ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ εἰς πόλιν Μωαβ ἥ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων Αρνων ὅ ἐστιν ἐκ μέρους τῶν ὁρίων
37 καὶ εἶπεν Βαλακ πρὸς Βαλααμ οὐχὶ ἀπέστειλα πρὸς σὲ καλέσαι σε διὰ τί οὐκ ἤρχου πρός με ὄντως οὐ δυνήσομαι τιμῆσαί σε
38 καὶ εἶπεν Βαλααμ πρὸς Βαλακ ἰδοὺ ἥκω πρὸς σέ νῦν δυνατὸς ἔσομαι λαλῆσαί τι τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐὰν βάλῃ ὁ θεὸς εἰς τὸ στόμα μου τοῦτο λαλήσω
39 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Βαλααμ μετὰ Βαλακ καὶ ἦλθον εἰς πόλεις ἐπαύλεων
40 καὶ ἔθυσεν Βαλακ πρόβατα καὶ μόσχους καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τῷ Βαλααμ καὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσι τοῖς με{T'} αὐτοῦ
41 καὶ ἐγενήθη πρωὶ καὶ παραλαβὼν Βαλακ τὸν Βαλααμ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν στήλην τοῦ Βααλ καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ ἐκεῖθεν μέρος τι τοῦ λαοῦ
