# Book of Numbers 27 (RSVCE)

### The Daughters of Zelophehad
1 Then drew near the daughters of Zelophʹehad the son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasʹseh, from the families of Manasʹseh the son of Joseph. The names of his daughters were: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
2 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleaʹzar the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying,
3 “Our father died in the wilderness; he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against theLordin the company of Korah, but died for his own sin; and he had no sons.
4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession among our father’s brethren.”
5 Moses brought their case before theLord.
6 And theLordsaid to Moses,
7 “The daughters of Zelophʹehad are right; you shall give them possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.
8 And you shall say to the people of Israel, ‘If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.
9 And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
10 And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.
11 And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be to the people of Israel a statute and ordinance, as theLordcommanded Moses.’ ”
### Joshua Appointed Moses’ Successor
12 TheLordsaid to Moses, “Go up into this mountain of Abʹarim, and see the land which I have given to the people of Israel.
13 And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was gathered,
14 because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin during the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes.” (These are the waters of Merʹibah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
15 Moses said to theLord,
16 “Let theLord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
17 who shall go out before them and come in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in; that the congregation of theLordmay not be as sheep which have no shepherd.”
18 And theLordsaid to Moses, “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand upon him;
19 cause him to stand before Eleaʹzar the priest and all the congregation, and you shall commission him in their sight.
20 You shall invest him with some of your authority, that all the congregation of the people of Israel may obey.
21 And he shall stand before Eleaʹzar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before theLord; at his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the people of Israel with him, the whole congregation.”
22 And Moses did as theLordcommanded him; he took Joshua and caused him to stand before Eleaʹzar the priest and the whole congregation,
23 and he laid his hands upon him, and commissioned him as theLorddirected through Moses.


# Liber Numeri 27 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Accesserunt autem filiæ Salphaad, filii Hepher, filii Galaad, filii Machir, filii Manasse, qui fuit filius Joseph: quarum sunt nomina, Maala, et Noa, et Hegla, et Melcha, et Thersa.
2 Steteruntque coram Moyse et Eleazaro sacerdote et cunctis principibus populi ad ostium tabernaculi fœderis, atque dixerunt:
3 Pater noster mortuus est in deserto, nec fuit in seditione, quæ concitata est contra Dominum sub Core, sed in peccato suo mortuus est: hic non habuit mares filios. Cur tollitur nomen illius de familia sua, quia non habuit filium? date nobis possessionem inter cognatos patris nostri.
4 Retulitque Moyses causam earum ad judicium Domini.
5 Qui dixit ad eum:
6 Justam rem postulant filiæ Salphaad: da eis possessionem inter cognatos patris sui, et ei in hæreditatem succedant.
7 Ad filios autem Israël loqueris hæc:
8 Homo cum mortuus fuerit absque filio, ad filiam ejus transibit hæreditas.
9 Si filiam non habuerit, habebit successores fratres suos.
10 Quod si et fratres non fuerint, dabitis hæreditatem fratribus patris ejus.
11 Sin autem nec patruos habuerit, dabitur hæreditas his qui ei proximi sunt. Eritque hoc filiis Israël sanctum lege perpetua, sicut præcepit Dominus Moysi.

12 Dixit quoque Dominus ad Moysen: Ascende in montem istum Abarim, et contemplare inde terram, quam daturus sum filiis Israël.
13 Cumque videris eam, ibis et tu ad populum tuum, sicut ivit frater tuus Aaron:
14 quia offendistis me in deserto Sin in contradictione multitudinis, nec sanctificare me voluistis coram ea super aquas. Hæ sunt aquæ contradictionis in Cades deserti Sin.
15 Cui respondit Moyses:
16 Provideat Dominus Deus spirituum omnis carnis hominem, qui sit super multitudinem hanc:
17 et possit exire et intrare ante eos, et educere eos vel introducere: ne sit populus Domini sicut oves absque pastore.
18 Dixitque Dominus ad eum: Tolle Josue filium Nun, virum in quo est spiritus, et pone manum tuam super eum.
19 Qui stabit coram Eleazaro sacerdote et omni multitudine:
20 et dabis ei præcepta cunctis videntibus, et partem gloriæ tuæ, ut audiat eum omnis synagoga filiorum Israël.
21 Pro hoc, si quid agendum erit, Eleazar sacerdos consulet Dominum. Ad verbum ejus egredietur et ingredietur ipse, et omnes filii Israël cum eo, et cetera multitudo.
22 Fecit Moyses ut præceperat Dominus: cumque tulisset Josue, statuit eum coram Eleazaro sacerdote et omni frequentia populi.
23 Et impositis capiti ejus manibus, cuncta replicavit quæ mandaverat Dominus.

1 καὶ προσελθοῦσαι αἱ θυγατέρες Σαλπααδ υἱοῦ Οφερ υἱοῦ Γαλααδ υἱοῦ Μαχιρ τοῦ δήμου Μανασση τῶν υἱῶν Ιωσηφ καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν Μαλα καὶ Νουα καὶ Εγλα καὶ Μελχα καὶ Θερσα
2 καὶ στᾶσαι ἔναντι Μωυσῆ καὶ ἔναντι Ελεαζαρ τοῦ ἱερέως καὶ ἔναντι τῶν ἀρχόντων καὶ ἔναντι πάσης συναγωγῆς ἐπὶ τῆς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου λέγουσιν
3 ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν ἀπέθανεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ καὶ αὐτὸς οὐκ ἦν ἐν μέσῳ τῆς συναγωγῆς τῆς ἐπισυστάσης ἔναντι κυρίου ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ Κορε ὅτι διὰ ἁμαρτίαν αὐτοῦ ἀπέθανεν καὶ υἱοὶ οὐκ ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ
4 μὴ ἐξαλειφθήτω τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν ἐκ μέσου τοῦ δήμου αὐτοῦ ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ υἱός δότε ἡμῖν κατάσχεσιν ἐν μέσῳ ἀδελφῶν πατρὸς ἡμῶν
5 καὶ προσήγαγεν Μωυσῆς τὴν κρίσιν αὐτῶν ἔναντι κυρίου
6 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων
7 ὀρθῶς θυγατέρες Σαλπααδ λελαλήκασιν δόμα δώσεις αὐταῖς κατάσχεσιν κληρονομίας ἐν μέσῳ ἀδελφῶν πατρὸς αὐτῶν καὶ περιθήσεις τὸν κλῆρον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν αὐταῖς
8 καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ λαλήσεις λέγων ἄνθρωπος ἐὰν ἀποθάνῃ καὶ υἱὸς μὴ ᾖ αὐτῷ περιθήσετε τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ τῇ θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ
9 ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ᾖ θυγάτηρ αὐτῷ δώσετε τὴν κληρονομίαν τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ
10 ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ὦσιν αὐτῷ ἀδελφοί δώσετε τὴν κληρονομίαν τῷ ἀδελφῷ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ
11 ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ὦσιν ἀδελφοὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ δώσετε τὴν κληρονομίαν τῷ οἰκείῳ τῷ ἔγγιστα αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς αὐτοῦ κληρονομήσει τὰ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔσται τοῦτο τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ δικαίωμα κρίσεως καθὰ συνέταξεν κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ

12 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν ἀνάβηθι εἰς τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦτο ὄρος Ναβαυ καὶ ἰδὲ τὴν γῆν Χανααν ἣν ἐγὼ δίδωμι τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ ἐν κατασχέσει
13 καὶ ὄψει αὐτὴν καὶ προστεθήσῃ πρὸς τὸν λαόν σου καὶ σύ καθὰ προσετέθη Ααρων ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἐν Ωρ τῷ ὄρει
14 διότι παρέβητε τὸ ῥῆμά μου ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σιν ἐν τῷ ἀντιπίπτειν τὴν συναγωγὴν ἁγιάσαι με οὐχ ἡγιάσατέ με ἐπὶ τῷ ὕδατι ἔναντι αὐτῶν τοῦτό ἐστιν ὕδωρ ἀντιλογίας Καδης ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σιν
15 καὶ εἶπεν Μωυσῆς πρὸς κύριον
16 ἐπισκεψάσθω κύριος ὁ θεὸς τῶν πνευμάτων καὶ πάσης σαρκὸς ἄνθρωπον ἐπὶ τῆς συναγωγῆς ταύτης
17 ὅστις ἐξελεύσεται πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν καὶ ὅστις εἰσελεύσεται πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν καὶ ὅστις ἐξάξει αὐτοὺς καὶ ὅστις εἰσάξει αὐτούς καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἡ συναγωγὴ κυρίου ὡσεὶ πρόβατα οἷς οὐκ ἔστιν ποιμήν
18 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων λαβὲ πρὸς σεαυτὸν τὸν Ἰησοῦν υἱὸν Ναυη ἄνθρωπον ὃς ἔχει πνεῦμα ἐν ἑαυτῷ καὶ ἐπιθήσεις τὰς χεῖράς σου ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν
19 καὶ στήσεις αὐτὸν ἔναντι Ελεαζαρ τοῦ ἱερέως καὶ ἐντελῇ αὐτῷ ἔναντι πάσης συναγωγῆς καὶ ἐντελῇ περὶ αὐτοῦ ἐναντίον αὐτῶν
20 καὶ δώσεις τῆς δόξης σου ἐ{P'} αὐτόν ὅπως ἂν εἰσακούσωσιν αὐτοῦ οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ
21 καὶ ἔναντι Ελεαζαρ τοῦ ἱερέως στήσεται καὶ ἐπερωτήσουσιν αὐτὸν τὴν κρίσιν τῶν δήλων ἔναντι κυρίου ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ ἐξελεύσονται καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ εἰσελεύσονται αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ὁμοθυμαδὸν καὶ πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγή
22 καὶ ἐποίησεν Μωυσῆς καθὰ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ κύριος καὶ λαβὼν τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἔστησεν αὐτὸν ἐναντίον Ελεαζαρ τοῦ ἱερέως καὶ ἔναντι πάσης συναγωγῆς
23 καὶ ἐπέθηκεν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν καὶ συνέστησεν αὐτόν καθάπερ συνέταξεν κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ
