# Book of Numbers 4 (RSVCE)

### The Kohathites
1 TheLordsaid to Moses and Aaron,
2 “Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families and their fathers’ houses,
3 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, all who can enter the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
4 This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting: the most holy things.
5 When the camp is to set out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it;
6 then they shall put on it a covering of goatskin, and spread over that a cloth all of blue, and shall put in its poles.
7 And over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put upon it the plates, the dishes for incense, the bowls, and the flagons for the drink offering; the continual bread also shall be on it;
8 then they shall spread over them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of goatskin, and shall put in its poles.
9 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the lampstand for the light, with its lamps, its snuffers, its trays, and all the vessels for oil with which it is supplied:
10 and they shall put it with all its utensils in a covering of goatskin and put it upon the carrying frame.
11 And over the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of goatskin, and shall put in its poles;
12 and they shall take all the vessels of the service which are used in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of goatskin, and put them on the carrying frame.
13 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it;
14 and they shall put on it all the utensils of the altar, which are used for the service there, the firepans, the forks, the shovels, and the basins, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of goatskin, and shall put in its poles.
15 And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, as the camp sets out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry these, but they must not touch the holy things, lest they die. These are the things of the tent of meeting which the sons of Kohath are to carry.
16 “And Eleaʹzar the son of Aaron the priest shall have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the continual cereal offering, and the anointing oil, with the oversight of all the tabernacle and all that is in it, of the sanctuary and its vessels.”
17 TheLordsaid to Moses and Aaron,
18 “Let not the tribe of the families of the Koʹhathites be destroyed from among the Levites;
19 but deal thus with them, that they may live and not die when they come near to the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint them each to his task and to his burden,
20 but they shall not go in to look upon the holy things even for a moment, lest they die.”
### The Gershonites and Merarites
21 TheLordsaid to Moses,
22 “Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their families and their fathers’ houses;
23 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, you shall number them, all who can enter for service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
24 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and bearing burdens:
25 they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting with its covering, and the covering of goatskin that is on top of it, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,
26 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the entrance of the gate of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords, and all the equipment for their service; and they shall do all that needs to be done with regard to them.
27 All the service of the sons of the Gershonites shall be at the command of Aaron and his sons, in all that they are to carry, and in all that they have to do; and you shall assign to their charge all that they are to carry.
28 This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting, and their work is to be under the oversight of Ithʹamar the son of Aaron the priest.
29 “As for the sons of Merarʹi, you shall number them by their families and their fathers’ houses;
30 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, you shall number them, every one that can enter the service, to do the work of the tent of meeting.
31 And this is what they are charged to carry, as the whole of their service in the tent of meeting: the frames of the tabernacle, with its bars, pillars, and bases,
32 and the pillars of the court round about with their bases, pegs, and cords, with all their equipment and all their accessories; and you shall assign by name the objects which they are required to carry.
33 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merarʹi, the whole of their service in the tent of meeting, under the hand of Ithʹamar the son of Aaron the priest.”
### Census of the Levites
34 And Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Koʹhathites, by their families and their fathers’ houses,
35 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, every one that could enter the service, for work in the tent of meeting;
36 and their number by families was two thousand seven hundred and fifty.
37 This was the number of the families of the Koʹhathites, all who served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of theLordby Moses.
38 The number of the sons of Gershon, by their families and their fathers’ houses,
39 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, every one that could enter the service for work in the tent of meeting—
40 their number by their families and their fathers’ houses was two thousand six hundred and thirty.
41 This was the number of the families of the sons of Gershon, all who served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of theLord.
42 The number of the families of the sons of Merarʹi, by their families and their fathers’ houses,
43 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, every one that could enter the service, for work in the tent of meeting—
44 their number by families was three thousand two hundred.
45 These are those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merarʹi, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of theLordby Moses.
46 All those who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel numbered, by their families and their fathers’ houses,
47 from thirty years old up to fifty years old, every one that could enter to do the work of service and the work of bearing burdens in the tent of meeting,
48 those who were numbered of them were eight thousand five hundred and eighty.
49 According to the commandment of theLordthrough Moses they were appointed, each to his task of serving or carrying; thus they were numbered by him, as theLordcommanded Moses.


# Liber Numeri 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen et Aaron, dicens:
2 Tolle summam filiorum Caath de medio Levitarum per domos et familias suas,
3 a trigesimo anno et supra, usque ad quinquagesimum annum, omnium qui ingrediuntur ut stent et ministrent in tabernaculo fœderis.
4 Hic est cultus filiorum Caath: tabernaculum fœderis, et Sanctum sanctorum
5 ingredientur Aaron et filii ejus, quando movenda sunt castra, et deponent velum quod pendet ante fores, involventque eo arcam testimonii,
6 et operient rursum velamine janthinarum pellium, extendentque desuper pallium totum hyacinthinum, et inducent vectes.
7 Mensam quoque propositionis involvent hyacinthino pallio, et ponent cum ea thuribula et mortariola, cyathos et crateras ad liba fundenda: panes semper in ea erunt:
8 extendentque desuper pallium coccineum, quod rursum operient velamento janthinarum pellium, et inducent vectes.
9 Sument et pallium hyacinthinum, quo operient candelabrum cum lucernis et forcipibus suis et emunctoriis et cunctis vasis olei, quæ ad concinnandas lucernas necessaria sunt:
10 et super omnia ponent operimentum janthinarum pellium, et inducent vectes.
11 Necnon et altare aureum involvent hyacinthino vestimento, et extendent desuper operimentum janthinarum pellium, inducentque vectes.
12 Omnia vasa, quibus ministratur in sanctuario, involvent hyacinthino pallio, et extendent desuper operimentum janthinarum pellium, inducentque vectes.
13 Sed et altare mundabunt cinere, et involvent illud purpureo vestimento,
14 ponentque cum eo omnia vasa, quibus in ministerio ejus utuntur, id est, ignium receptacula, fuscinulas ac tridentes, uncinos et batilla. Cuncta vasa altaris operient simul velamine janthinarum pellium, et inducent vectes.
15 Cumque involverint Aaron et filii ejus sanctuarium et omnia vasa ejus in commotione castrorum, tunc intrabunt filii Caath ut portent involuta: et non tangent vasa sanctuarii, ne moriantur. Ista sunt onera filiorum Caath in tabernaculo fœderis:
16 super quos erit Eleazar filius Aaron sacerdotis, ad cujus curam pertinet oleum ad concinnandas lucernas, et compositionis incensum, et sacrificium, quod semper offertur, et oleum unctionis, et quidquid ad cultum tabernaculi pertinet, omniumque vasorum, quæ in sanctuario sunt.
17 Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen et Aaron, dicens:
18 Nolite perdere populum Caath de medio Levitarum:
19 sed hoc facite eis, ut vivant, et non moriantur, si tetigerint Sancta sanctorum. Aaron et filii ejus intrabunt, ipsique disponent opera singulorum, et divident quid portare quis debeat.
20 Alii nulla curiositate videant quæ sunt in sanctuario priusquam involvantur, alioquin morientur.

21 Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen, dicens:
22 Tolle summam etiam filiorum Gerson per domos ac familias et cognationes suas,
23 a triginta annis et supra, usque ad annos quinquaginta. Numera omnes qui ingrediuntur et ministrant in tabernaculo fœderis.
24 Hoc est officium familiæ Gersonitarum,
25 ut portent cortinas tabernaculi et tectum fœderis, operimentum aliud, et super omnia velamen janthinum tentoriumque quod pendet in introitu tabernaculi fœderis,
26 cortinas atrii, et velum in introitu quod est ante tabernaculum. Omnia quæ ad altare pertinent, funiculos, et vasa ministerii,
27 jubente Aaron et filiis ejus, portabunt filii Gerson: et scient singuli cui debeant oneri mancipari.
28 Hic est cultus familiæ Gersonitarum in tabernaculo fœderis, eruntque sub manu Ithamar filii Aaron sacerdotis.
29 Filios quoque Merari per familias et domos patrum suorum recensebis,
30 a triginta annis et supra, usque ad annos quinquaginta, omnes qui ingrediuntur ad officium ministerii sui et cultum fœderis testimonii.
31 Hæc sunt onera eorum: portabunt tabulas tabernaculi et vectes ejus, columnas ac bases earum,
32 columnas quoque atrii per circuitum cum basibus et paxillis et funibus suis. Omnia vasa et supellectilem ad numerum accipient, sicque portabunt.
33 Hoc est officium familiæ Meraritarum et ministerium in tabernaculo fœderis: eruntque sub manu Ithamar filii Aaron sacerdotis.

34 Recensuerunt igitur Moyses et Aaron et principes synagogæ filios Caath per cognationes et domos patrum suorum,
35 a triginta annis et supra, usque ad annum quinquagesimum, omnes qui ingrediuntur ad ministerium tabernaculi fœderis:
36 et inventi sunt duo millia septingenti quinquaginta.
38 Hic est numerus populi Caath qui intrant tabernaculum fœderis: hos numeravit Moyses et Aaron juxta sermonem Domini per manum Moysi.
40 Numerati sunt et filii Gerson per cognationes et domos patrum suorum,
42 a triginta annos et supra, usque ad quinquagesimum annum, omnes qui ingrediuntur ut ministrent in tabernaculo fœderis:
44 et inventi sunt duo millia sexcenti triginta.
46 Hic est populus Gersonitarum, quos numeraverunt Moyses et Aaron juxta verbum Domini.
47 Numerati sunt et filii Merari per cognationes et domos patrum suorum,
48 a triginta annis et supra, usque ad annum quinquagesimum, omnes qui ingrediuntur ad explendos ritus tabernaculi fœderis:
49 et inventi sunt tria millia ducenti.
