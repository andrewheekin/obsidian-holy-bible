# Book of Numbers 12 (RSVCE)

### Aaron and Miriam Jealous of Moses
1 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman;
2 and they said, “Has theLordindeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?” And theLordheard it.
3 Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all men that were on the face of the earth.
4 And suddenly theLordsaid to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, “Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.” And the three of them came out.
5 And theLordcame down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward.
6 And he said, “Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I theLordmake myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream.
7 Not so with my servant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house.
8 With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in dark speech; and he beholds the form of theLord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?”
9 And the anger of theLordwas kindled against them, and he departed;
10 and when the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned towards Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
11 And Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, do not punish us because we have done foolishly and have sinned.
12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”
13 And Moses cried to theLord, “Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.”
14 But theLordsaid to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.”
15 So Miriam was shut up outside the camp seven days; and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again.
16 After that the people set out from Hazeʹroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.


# Liber Numeri 12 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Locutaque est Maria et Aaron contra Moysen propter uxorem ejus Æthiopissam,
2 et dixerunt: Num per solum Moysen locutus est Dominus? nonne et nobis similiter est locutus? Quod cum audisset Dominus
3 (erat enim Moyses vir mitissimus super omnes homines qui morabantur in terra),
4 statim locutus est ad eum, et ad Aaron et Mariam: Egredimini vos tantum tres ad tabernaculum fœderis. Cumque fuissent egressi,
5 descendit Dominus in columna nubis, et stetit in introitu tabernaculi, vocans Aaron et Mariam. Qui cum issent,
6 dixit ad eos: Audite sermones meos: si quis fuerit inter vos propheta Domini, in visione apparebo ei, vel per somnium loquar ad illum.
7 At non talis servus meus Moyses, qui in omni domo mea fidelissimus est:
8 ore enim ad os loquor ei: et palam, et non per ænigmata et figuras Dominum videt. Quare ergo non timuistis detrahere servo meo Moysi?
9 Iratusque contra eos, abiit:
10 nubes quoque recessit quæ erat super tabernaculum: et ecce Maria apparuit candens lepra quasi nix. Cumque respexisset eam Aaron, et vidisset perfusam lepra,
11 ait ad Moysen: Obsecro, domine mi, ne imponas nobis hoc peccatum quod stulte commisimus,
12 ne fiat hæc quasi mortua, et ut abortivum quod projicitur de vulva matris suæ: ecce jam medium carnis ejus devoratum est a lepra.
13 Clamavitque Moyses ad Dominum, dicens: Deus, obsecro, sana eam.
14 Cui respondit Dominus: Si pater ejus spuisset in faciem illius, nonne debuerat saltem septem diebus rubore suffundi? separetur septem diebus extra castra, et postea revocabitur.
15 Exclusa est itaque Maria extra castra septem diebus: et populus non est motus de loco illo, donec revocata est Maria.

1 καὶ ἐλάλησεν Μαριαμ καὶ Ααρων κατὰ Μωυσῆ ἕνεκεν τῆς γυναικὸς τῆς Αἰθιοπίσσης ἣν ἔλαβεν Μωυσῆς ὅτι γυναῖκα Αἰθιόπισσαν ἔλαβεν
2 καὶ εἶπαν μὴ Μωυσῇ μόνῳ λελάληκεν κύριος οὐχὶ καὶ ἡμῖν ἐλάλησεν καὶ ἤκουσεν κύριος
3 καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος Μωυσῆς πραῢς σφόδρα παρὰ πάντας τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοὺς ὄντας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
4 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος παραχρῆμα πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Μαριαμ καὶ Ααρων ἐξέλθατε ὑμεῖς οἱ τρεῖς εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ τρεῖς εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου
5 καὶ κατέβη κύριος ἐν στύλῳ νεφέλης καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ τῆς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου καὶ ἐκλήθησαν Ααρων καὶ Μαριαμ καὶ ἐξήλθοσαν ἀμφότεροι
6 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς ἀκούσατε τῶν λόγων μου ἐὰν γένηται προφήτης ὑμῶν κυρίῳ ἐν ὁράματι αὐτῷ γνωσθήσομαι καὶ ἐν ὕπνῳ λαλήσω αὐτῷ
7 οὐχ οὕτως ὁ θεράπων μου Μωυσῆς ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ οἴκῳ μου πιστός ἐστιν
8 στόμα κατὰ στόμα λαλήσω αὐτῷ ἐν εἴδει καὶ οὐ δ{I'} αἰνιγμάτων καὶ τὴν δόξαν κυρίου εἶδεν καὶ διὰ τί οὐκ ἐφοβήθητε καταλαλῆσαι κατὰ τοῦ θεράποντός μου Μωυσῆ
9 καὶ ὀργὴ θυμοῦ κυρίου ἐ{P'} αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀπῆλθεν
10 καὶ ἡ νεφέλη ἀπέστη ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ ἰδοὺ Μαριαμ λεπρῶσα ὡσεὶ χιών καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν Ααρων ἐπὶ Μαριαμ καὶ ἰδοὺ λεπρῶσα
11 καὶ εἶπεν Ααρων πρὸς Μωυσῆν δέομαι κύριε μὴ συνεπιθῇ ἡμῖν ἁμαρτίαν διότι ἠγνοήσαμεν καθότι ἡμάρτομεν
12 μὴ γένηται ὡσεὶ ἴσον θανάτῳ ὡσεὶ ἔκτρωμα ἐκπορευόμενον ἐκ μήτρας μητρὸς καὶ κατεσθίει τὸ ἥμισυ τῶν σαρκῶν αὐτῆς
13 καὶ ἐβόησεν Μωυσῆς πρὸς κύριον λέγων ὁ θεός δέομαί σου ἴασαι αὐτήν
14 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν εἰ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῆς πτύων ἐνέπτυσεν εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς οὐκ ἐντραπήσεται ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἀφορισθήτω ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσεται
15 καὶ ἀφωρίσθη Μαριαμ ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας καὶ ὁ λαὸς οὐκ ἐξῆρεν ἕως ἐκαθαρίσθη Μαριαμ
