# Book of Numbers 9 (RSVCE)

### The Passover at Sinai
1 And theLordspoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
2 “Let the people of Israel keep the passover at its appointed time.
3 On the fourteenth day of this month, in the evening, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its ordinances you shall keep it.”
4 So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the passover.
5 And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that theLordcommanded Moses, so the people of Israel did.
6 And there were certain men who were unclean through touching the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day;
7 and those men said to him, “We are unclean through touching the dead body of a man; why are we kept from offering theLord’s offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?”
8 And Moses said to them, “Wait, that I may hear what theLordwill command concerning you.”
9 TheLordsaid to Moses,
10 “Say to the people of Israel, If any man of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is afar off on a journey, he shall still keep the passover to theLord.
11 In the second month on the fourteenth day in the evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
12 They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute for the passover they shall keep it.
13 But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, yet refrains from keeping the passover, that person shall be cut off from his people, because he did not offer theLord’s offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.
14 And if a stranger sojourns among you, and will keep the passover to theLord, according to the statute of the passover and according to its ordinance, so shall he do; you shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native.”
### The Cloud and the Fire
15 On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony; and at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning.
16 So it was continually; the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night.
17 And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel encamped.
18 At the command of theLordthe people of Israel set out, and at the command of theLordthey encamped; as long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.
19 Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel kept the charge of theLord, and did not set out.
20 Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of theLordthey remained in camp; then according to the command of theLordthey set out.
21 And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud was taken up they set out.
22 Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel remained in camp and did not set out; but when it was taken up they set out.
23 At the command of theLordthey encamped, and at the command of theLordthey set out; they kept the charge of theLord, at the command of theLordby Moses.


# Liber Numeri 9 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Locutus est Dominus ad Moysen in deserto Sinai anno secundo, postquam egressi sunt de terra Ægypti, mense primo, dicens:
2 Faciant filii Israël Phase in tempore suo,
3 quartadecima die mensis hujus ad vesperam, juxta omnes cæremonias et justificationes ejus.
4 Præcepitque Moyses filiis Israël ut facerent Phase.
5 Qui fecerunt tempore suo, quartadecima die mensis ad vesperam, in monte Sinai. Juxta omnia quæ mandaverat Dominus Moysi, fecerunt filii Israël.
6 Ecce autem quidam immundi super anima hominis, qui non poterant facere Phase in die illo, accedentes ad Moysen et Aaron,
7 dixerunt eis: Immundi sumus super anima hominis: quare fraudamur ut non valeamus oblationem offerre Domino in tempore suo inter filios Israël?
8 Quibus respondit Moyses: State ut consulam quid præcipiat Dominus de vobis.

9 Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen, dicens:
10 Loquere filiis Israël: Homo, qui fuerit immundus super anima, sive in via procul in gente vestra, faciat Phase Domino
11 in mense secundo, quartadecima die mensis ad vesperam. Cum azymis et lactucis agrestibus comedent illud:
12 non relinquent ex eo quippiam usque mane, et os ejus non confringent: omnem ritum Phase observabunt.
13 Si quis autem et mundus est, et in itinere non fuit, et tamen non fecit Phase, exterminabitur anima illa de populis suis, quia sacrificium Domino non obtulit tempore suo: peccatum suum ipse portabit.
14 Peregrinus quoque et advena si fuerint apud vos, facient Phase Domino juxta cæremonias et justificationes ejus. Præceptum idem erit apud vos tam advenæ quam indigenæ.

15 Igitur die qua erectum est tabernaculum, operuit illud nubes. A vespere autem super tentorium erat quasi species ignis usque mane.
16 Sic fiebat jugiter: per diem operiebat illud nubes, et per noctem quasi species ignis.
17 Cumque ablata fuisset nubes, quæ tabernaculum protegebat, tunc proficiscebantur filii Israël: et in loco ubi stetisset nubes, ibi castrametabantur.
18 Ad imperium Domini proficiscebantur, et ad imperium illius figebant tabernaculum. Cunctis diebus quibus stabat nubes super tabernaculum, manebant in eodem loco:
19 et si evenisset ut multo tempore maneret super illud, erant filii Israël in excubiis Domini, et non proficiscebantur
20 quot diebus fuisset nubes super tabernaculum. Ad imperium Domini erigebant tentoria, et ad imperium illius deponebant.
21 Si fuisset nubes a vespere usque mane, et statim diluculo tabernaculum reliquisset, proficiscebantur: et si post diem et noctem recessisset, dissipabant tentoria.
22 Si vero biduo aut uno mense vel longiori tempore fuisset super tabernaculum, manebant filii Israël in eodem loco, et non proficiscebantur: statim autem ut recessisset, movebant castra.
23 Per verbum Domini figebant tentoria, et per verbum illius proficiscebantur: erantque in excubiis Domini juxta imperium ejus per manum Moysi.

1 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σινα ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ δευτέρῳ ἐξελθόντων αὐτῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ πρώτῳ λέγων
2 εἰπὸν καὶ ποιείτωσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τὸ πασχα κα{Q'} ὥραν αὐτοῦ
3 τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου πρὸς ἑσπέραν ποιήσεις αὐτὸ κατὰ καιρούς κατὰ τὸν νόμον αὐτοῦ καὶ κατὰ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ ποιήσεις αὐτό
4 καὶ ἐλάλησεν Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ ποιῆσαι τὸ πασχα
5 ἐναρχομένου τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τοῦ Σινα καθὰ συνέταξεν κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ οὕτως ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ
6 καὶ παρεγένοντο οἱ ἄνδρες οἳ ἦσαν ἀκάθαρτοι ἐπὶ ψυχῇ ἀνθρώπου καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο ποιῆσαι τὸ πασχα ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ προσῆλθον ἐναντίον Μωυσῆ καὶ Ααρων ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
7 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄνδρες ἐκεῖνοι πρὸς αὐτόν ἡμεῖς ἀκάθαρτοι ἐπὶ ψυχῇ ἀνθρώπου μὴ οὖν ὑστερήσωμεν προσενέγκαι τὸ δῶρον κυρίῳ κατὰ καιρὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν Ισραηλ
8 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Μωυσῆς στῆτε αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀκούσομαι τί ἐντελεῖται κύριος περὶ ὑμῶν

9 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων
10 λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ λέγων ἄνθρωπος ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἐὰν γένηται ἀκάθαρτος ἐπὶ ψυχῇ ἀνθρώπου ἢ ἐν ὁδῷ μακρὰν ὑμῖν ἢ ἐν ταῖς γενεαῖς ὑμῶν καὶ ποιήσει τὸ πασχα κυρίῳ
11 ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἐν τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τὸ πρὸς ἑσπέραν ποιήσουσιν αὐτό ἐ{P'} ἀζύμων καὶ πικρίδων φάγονται αὐτό
12 οὐ καταλείψουσιν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ πρωὶ καὶ ὀστοῦν οὐ συντρίψουσιν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ κατὰ τὸν νόμον τοῦ πασχα ποιήσουσιν αὐτό
13 καὶ ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἐὰν καθαρὸς ᾖ καὶ ἐν ὁδῷ μακρᾷ οὐκ ἔστιν καὶ ὑστερήσῃ ποιῆσαι τὸ πασχα ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς ὅτι τὸ δῶρον κυρίῳ οὐ προσήνεγκεν κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν αὐτοῦ ἁμαρτίαν αὐτοῦ λήμψεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος
14 ἐὰν δὲ προσέλθῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς προσήλυτος ἐν τῇ γῇ ὑμῶν καὶ ποιήσει τὸ πασχα κυρίῳ κατὰ τὸν νόμον τοῦ πασχα καὶ κατὰ τὴν σύνταξιν αὐτοῦ ποιήσει αὐτό νόμος εἷς ἔσται ὑμῖν καὶ τῷ προσηλύτῳ καὶ τῷ αὐτόχθονι τῆς γῆς

15 καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐστάθη ἡ σκηνή ἐκάλυψεν ἡ νεφέλη τὴν σκηνήν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ μαρτυρίου καὶ τὸ ἑσπέρας ἦν ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς ὡς εἶδος πυρὸς ἕως πρωί
16 οὕτως ἐγίνετο διὰ παντός ἡ νεφέλη ἐκάλυπτεν αὐτὴν ἡμέρας καὶ εἶδος πυρὸς τὴν νύκτα
17 καὶ ἡνίκα ἀνέβη ἡ νεφέλη ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπῆραν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ οὗ ἂν ἔστη ἡ νεφέλη ἐκεῖ παρενέβαλον οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ
18 διὰ προστάγματος κυρίου παρεμβαλοῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ διὰ προστάγματος κυρίου ἀπαροῦσιν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἐν αἷς σκιάζει ἡ νεφέλη ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς παρεμβαλοῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ
19 καὶ ὅταν ἐφέλκηται ἡ νεφέλη ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς ἡμέρας πλείους καὶ φυλάξονται οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τὴν φυλακὴν τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξάρωσιν
20 καὶ ἔσται ὅταν σκεπάσῃ ἡ νεφέλη ἡμέρας ἀριθμῷ ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς διὰ φωνῆς κυρίου παρεμβαλοῦσιν καὶ διὰ προστάγματος κυρίου ἀπαροῦσιν
21 καὶ ἔσται ὅταν γένηται ἡ νεφέλη ἀ{F'} ἑσπέρας ἕως πρωὶ καὶ ἀναβῇ ἡ νεφέλη τὸ πρωί καὶ ἀπαροῦσιν ἡμέρας ἢ νυκτός
22 μηνὸς ἡμέρας πλεοναζούσης τῆς νεφέλης σκιαζούσης ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς παρεμβαλοῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀπάρωσιν
23 ὅτι διὰ προστάγματος κυρίου ἀπαροῦσιν τὴν φυλακὴν κυρίου ἐφυλάξαντο διὰ προστάγματος κυρίου ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ
