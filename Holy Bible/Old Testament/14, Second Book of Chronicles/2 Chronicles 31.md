# Second Book of Chronicles 31 (RSVCE)

### Pagan Shrines Destroyed
1 Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke in pieces the pillars and hewed down the Asheʹrim and broke down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, and in Eʹphraim and Manasʹseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the people of Israel returned to their cities, every man to his possession.
2 And Hezekiʹah appointed the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, division by division, each according to his service, the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister in the gates of the camp of theLordand to give thanks and praise.
3 The contribution of the king from his own possessions was for the burnt offerings: the burnt offerings of morning and evening, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed feasts, as it is written in the law of theLord.
4 And he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of theLord.
5 As soon as the command was spread abroad, the people of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.
6 And the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the dedicated things which had been consecrated to theLordtheir God, and laid them in heaps.
7 In the third month they began to pile up the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
8 When Hezekiʹah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed theLordand his people Israel.
9 And Hezekiʹah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps.
10 Azariʹah the chief priest, who was of the house of Zadok, answered him, “Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of theLordwe have eaten and had enough and have plenty left; for theLordhas blessed his people, so that we have this great store left.”
### Reorganization of Priests and Levites
11 Then Hezekiʹah commanded them to prepare chambers in the house of theLord; and they prepared them.
12 And they faithfully brought in the contributions, the tithes and the dedicated things. The chief officer in charge of them was Conaniʹah the Levite, with Shimʹe-i his brother as second;
13 while Jehiʹel, Azaziʹah, Nahath, Asʹahel, Jerʹimoth, Joʹzabad, Eliʹel, Ismachiʹah, Mahath, and Benaiʹah were overseers assisting Conaniʹah and Shimʹe-i his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiʹah the king and Azariʹah the chief officer of the house of God.
14 And Korʹe the son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the east gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to apportion the contribution reserved for theLordand the most holy offerings.
15 Eden, Miniʹamin, Jeshua, Shemaiʹah, Amariʹah, and Shecaniʹah were faithfully assisting him in the cities of the priests, to distribute the portions to their brethren, old and young alike, by divisions,
16 except those enrolled by genealogy, males from three years old and upwards, all who entered the house of theLordas the duty of each day required, for their service according to their offices, by their divisions.
17 The enrollment of the priests was according to their fathers’ houses; that of the Levites from twenty years old and upwards was according to their offices, by their divisions.
18 The priests were enrolled with all their little children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, the whole multitude; for they were faithful in keeping themselves holy.
19 And for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields of common land belonging to their cities, there were men in the several cities who were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to every one among the Levites who was enrolled.
20 Thus Hezekiʹah did throughout all Judah; and he did what was good and right and faithful before theLordhis God.
21 And every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God and in accordance with the law and the commandments, seeking his God, he did with all his heart, and prospered.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 31 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Cumque hæc fuissent rite celebrata, egressus est omnis Israël qui inventus fuerat in urbibus Juda, et fregerunt simulacra, succideruntque lucos, demoliti sunt excelsa, et altaria destruxerunt, non solum de universo Juda et Benjamin, sed et de Ephraim quoque et Manasse, donec penitus everterent: reversique sunt omnes filii Israël in possessiones et civitates suas.

2 Ezechias autem constituit turmas sacerdotales et Leviticas per divisiones suas, unumquemque in officio proprio, tam sacerdotum videlicet quam Levitarum, ad holocausta et pacifica, ut ministrarent et confiterentur, canerentque in portis castrorum Domini.
3 Pars autem regis erat, ut de propria ejus substantia offerretur holocaustum, mane semper et vespere: sabbatis quoque, et calendis, et solemnitatibus ceteris, sicut scriptum est in lege Moysi.
4 Præcepit etiam populo habitantium Jerusalem ut darent partes sacerdotibus et Levitis, ut possent vacare legi Domini.
5 Quod cum percrebruisset in auribus multitudinis, plurimas obtulere primitias filii Israël frumenti, vini, et olei: mellis quoque, et omnium quæ gignit humus, decimas obtulerunt.
6 Sed et filii Israël et Juda qui habitabant in urbibus Juda, obtulerunt decimas boum et ovium, decimasque sanctorum quæ voverant Domino Deo suo: atque universa portantes, fecerunt acervos plurimos.
7 Mense tertio cœperunt acervorum jacere fundamenta, et mense septimo compleverunt eos.
8 Cumque ingressi fuissent Ezechias et principes ejus, viderunt acervos, et benedixerunt Domino ac populo Israël.

9 Interrogavitque Ezechias sacerdotes et Levitas, cur ita jacerent acervi.
10 Respondit illi Azarias sacerdos primus de stirpe Sadoc, dicens: Ex quo cœperunt offerri primitiæ in domo Domini, comedimus, et saturati sumus, et remanserunt plurima, eo quod benedixerit Dominus populo suo: reliquarum autem copia est ista, quam cernis.
11 Præcepit igitur Ezechias ut præpararent horrea in domo Domini. Quod cum fecissent,
12 intulerunt tam primitias quam decimas, et quæcumque voverant, fideliter. Fuit autem præfectus eorum Chonenias Levita, et Semei frater ejus secundus,
13 post quem Jahiel, et Azarias, et Nahath, et Asaël, et Jerimoth, Jozabad quoque, et Eliel, et Jesmachias, et Mahath, et Banaias, præpositi sub manibus Choneniæ et Semei fratris ejus, ex imperio Ezechiæ regis et Azariæ pontificis domus Dei, ad quos omnia pertinebant.
14 Core vero filius Jemna Levites, et janitor orientalis portæ, præpositus erat iis quæ sponte offerebantur Domino, primitiisque et consecratis in Sancta sanctorum.
15 Et sub cura ejus Eden, et Benjamin, Jesue, et Semeias, Amarias quoque, et Sechenias in civitatibus sacerdotum, ut fideliter distribuerent fratribus suis partes, minoribus atque majoribus:
16 exceptis maribus ab annis tribus et supra, cunctis qui ingrediebantur templum Domini, et quidquid per singulos dies conducebat in ministerio, atque observationibus juxta divisiones suas,
17 sacerdotibus per familias, et Levitis a vigesimo anno et supra, per ordines et turmas suas,
18 universæque multitudini tam uxoribus quam liberis eorum utriusque sexus, fideliter cibi de his quæ sanctificata fuerant, præbebantur.
19 Sed et filiorum Aaron per agros, et suburbana urbium singularum, dispositi erant viri, qui partes distribuerent universo sexui masculino de sacerdotibus et Levitis.

20 Fecit ergo Ezechias universa quæ diximus in omni Juda: operatusque est bonum et rectum, et verum coram Domino Deo suo,
21 in universa cultura ministerii domus Domini, juxta legem et cæremonias, volens requirere Deum suum in toto corde suo: fecitque, et prosperatus est.

1 καὶ ὡς συνετελέσθη πάντα ταῦτα ἐξῆλθεν πᾶς Ισραηλ οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἐν πόλεσιν Ιουδα καὶ συνέτριψαν τὰς στήλας καὶ ἐξέκοψαν τὰ ἄλση καὶ κατέσπασαν τὰ ὑψηλὰ καὶ τοὺς βωμοὺς ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ Βενιαμιν καὶ ἐξ Εφραιμ καὶ ἀπὸ Μανασση ἕως εἰς τέλος καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν πᾶς Ισραηλ ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν
