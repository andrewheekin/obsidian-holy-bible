# Second Book of Chronicles 35 (RSVCE)

### Celebration of the Passover
1 Josiʹah kept a passover to theLordin Jerusalem; and they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.
2 He appointed the priests to their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of theLord.
3 And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy to theLord, “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built; you need no longer carry it upon your shoulders. Now serve theLordyour God and his people Israel.
4 Prepare yourselves according to your fathers’ houses by your divisions, following the directions of David king of Israel and the directions of Solomon his son.
5 And stand in the holy place according to the groupings of the fathers’ houses of your brethren the lay people, and let there be for each a part of a father’s house of the Levites.
6 And kill the passover lamb, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of theLordby Moses.”
7 Then Josiʹah contributed to the lay people, as passover offerings for all that were present, lambs and kids from the flock to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls; these were from the king’s possessions.
8 And his princes contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiʹah, Zechariʹah, and Jehiʹel, the chief officers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred lambs and kids and three hundred bulls.
9 Conaniʹah also, and Shemaiʹah and Nethanʹel his brothers, and Hashabiʹah and Je-iʹel and Joʹzabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the passover offerings five thousand lambs and kids and five hundred bulls.
10 When the service had been prepared for, the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions according to the king’s command.
11 And they killed the passover lamb, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from them while the Levites flayed the victims.
12 And they set aside the burnt offerings that they might distribute them according to the groupings of the fathers’ houses of the lay people, to offer to theLord, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so they did with the bulls.
13 And they roasted the passover lamb with fire according to the ordinance; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the lay people.
14 And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the burnt offerings and the fat parts until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
15 The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduʹthun the king’s seer; and the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not need to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
16 So all the service of theLordwas prepared that day, to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of theLord, according to the command of King Josiʹah.
17 And the people of Israel who were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
18 No passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; none of the kings of Israel had kept such a passover as was kept by Josiʹah, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiʹah this passover was kept.
### Defeat by Pharaoh Neco and Death of Josiah
20 After all this, when Josiʹah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carʹchemish on the Euphraʹtes and Josiʹah went out against him.
21 But he sent envoys to him, saying, “What have we to do with each other, king of Judah? I am not coming against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to make haste. Cease opposing God, who is with me, lest he destroy you.”
22 Nevertheless Josiʹah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megidʹdo.
23 And the archers shot King Josiʹah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded.”
24 So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiʹah.
25 Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiʹah; and all the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josiʹah in their laments to this day. They made these an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are written in the Laments.
26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiʹah, and his good deeds according to what is written in the law of theLord,
27 and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 35 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Fecit autem Josias in Jerusalem Phase Domino, quod immolatum est quartadecima die mensis primi:
2 et constituit sacerdotes in officiis suis, hortatusque est eos ut ministrarent in domo Domini:
3 Levitis quoque, ad quorum eruditionem omnis Israël sanctificabatur Domino, locutus est: Ponite arcam in sanctuario templi, quod ædificavit Salomon filius David rex Israël, nequaquam enim eam ultra portabitis: nunc autem ministrate Domino Deo vestro, et populo ejus Israël.
4 Et præparate vos per domos et cognationes vestras in divisionibus singulorum, sicut præcepit David rex Israël, et descripsit Salomon filius ejus.
5 Et ministrate in sanctuario per familias turmasque Leviticas,
6 et sanctificati immolate Phase: fratres etiam vestros, ut possint juxta verba quæ locutus est Dominus in manu Moysi facere, præparate.
7 Dedit præterea Josias omni populo qui ibi fuerat inventus in solemnitate Phase, agnos et hædos de gregibus et reliqui pecoris triginta millia, boum quoque tria millia: hæc de regis universa substantia.
8 Duces quoque ejus sponte quod voverant, obtulerunt, tam populo quam sacerdotibus et Levitis. Porro Helcias, et Zacharias, et Jahiel principes domus Domini dederunt sacerdotibus ad faciendum Phase pecora commixtim duo millia sexcenta, et boves trecentos.
9 Chonenias autem, et Semeias, etiam Nathanaël fratres ejus, necnon Hasabias, et Jehiel, et Jozabad principes Levitarum, dederunt ceteris Levitis ad celebrandum Phase quinque millia pecorum, et boves quingentos.
10 Præparatumque est ministerium, et steterunt sacerdotes in officio suo: Levitæ quoque in turmis, juxta regis imperium.

11 Et immolatum est Phase: asperseruntque sacerdotes manu sua sanguinem, et Levitæ detraxerunt pelles holocaustorum:
12 et separaverunt ea ut darent per domos et familias singulorum, et offerrentur Domino, sicut scriptum est in libro Moysi: de bobus quoque fecerunt similiter.
13 Et assaverunt Phase super ignem, juxta quod in lege scriptum est: pacificas vero hostias coxerunt in lebetibus, et cacabis, et ollis, et festinato distribuerunt universæ plebi:
14 sibi autem et sacerdotibus postea paraverunt, nam in oblatione holocaustorum et adipum usque ad noctem sacerdotes fuerunt occupati, unde Levitæ sibi et sacerdotibus filiis Aaron paraverunt novissimis.
15 Porro cantores filii Asaph stabant in ordine suo, juxta præceptum David, et Asaph, et Heman, et Idithun prophetarum regis: janitores vero per portas singulas observabant, ita ut nec puncto quidem discederent a ministerio: quam ob rem et fratres eorum Levitæ paraverunt eis cibos.
16 Omnis igitur cultura Domini rite completa est in die illa, ut facerent Phase, et offerrent holocausta super altare Domini, juxta præceptum regis Josiæ.
17 Feceruntque filii Israël, qui reperti fuerant ibi, Phase in tempore illo, et solemnitatem azymorum septem diebus.
18 Non fuit Phase simile huic in Israël a diebus Samuelis prophetæ: sed nec quisquam de cunctis regibus Israël fecit Phase sicut Josias, sacerdotibus, et Levitis, et omni Judæ et Israël qui repertus fuerat, et habitantibus in Jerusalem.
19 Octavodecimo anno regni Josiæ hoc Phase celebratum est.

20 Postquam instauraverat Josias templum, ascendit Nechao rex Ægypti ad pugnandum in Charcamis juxta Euphraten: et processit in occursum ejus Josias.
21 At ille, missis ad eum nuntiis, ait: Quid mihi et tibi est, rex Juda? non adversum te hodie venio, sed contra aliam pugno domum, ad quam me Deus festinato ire præcepit: desine adversum Deum facere, qui mecum est, ne interficiat te.
22 Noluit Josias reverti, sed præparavit contra eum bellum, nec acquievit sermonibus Nechao ex ore Dei: verum perrexit ut dimicaret in campo Mageddo.
23 Ibique vulneratus a sagittariis, dixit pueris suis: Educite me de prælio, quia oppido vulneratus sum.
24 Qui transtulerunt eum de curru in alterum currum, qui sequebatur eum more regio, et asportaverunt eum in Jerusalem: mortuusque est, et sepultus in mausoleo patrum suorum, et universus Juda et Jerusalem luxerunt eum.
25 Jeremias maxime: cujus omnes cantores atque cantatrices, usque in præsentem diem, lamentationes super Josiam replicant, et quasi lex obtinuit in Israël: Ecce scriptum fertur in lamentationibus.

26 Reliqua autem sermonum Josiæ, et misericordiarum ejus, quæ lege præcepta sunt Domini,
27 opera quoque illius prima et novissima, scripta sunt in libro regum Juda et Israël.

1 καὶ ἐποίησεν Ιωσιας τὸ φασεχ τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθυσαν τὸ φασεχ τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου

9 καὶ Χωνενιας καὶ Βαναιας καὶ Σαμαιας καὶ Ναθαναηλ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ Ασαβια καὶ Ιιηλ καὶ Ιωζαβαδ ἄρχοντες τῶν Λευιτῶν ἀπήρξαντο τοῖς Λευίταις εἰς τὸ φασεχ πρόβατα πεντακισχίλια καὶ μόσχους πεντακοσίους
10 καὶ κατωρθώθη ἡ λειτουργία καὶ ἔστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐπὶ τὴν στάσιν αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐπὶ τὰς διαιρέσεις αὐτῶν κατὰ τὴν ἐντολὴν τοῦ βασιλέως

11 καὶ ἔθυσαν τὸ φασεχ καὶ προσέχεαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὸ αἷμα ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐξέδειραν
12 καὶ ἡτοίμασαν τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν παραδοῦναι αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὴν διαίρεσιν κα{T'} οἴκους πατριῶν τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ προσάγειν τῷ κυρίῳ ὡς γέγραπται ἐν βιβλίῳ Μωυσῆ καὶ οὕτως εἰς τὸ πρωί
13 καὶ ὤπτησαν τὸ φασεχ ἐν πυρὶ κατὰ τὴν κρίσιν καὶ τὰ ἅγια ἥψησαν ἐν τοῖς χαλκείοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς λέβησιν καὶ εὐοδώθη καὶ ἔδραμον πρὸς πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ
14 καὶ μετὰ τὸ ἑτοιμάσαι αὐτοῖς καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ὅτι οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐν τῷ ἀναφέρειν τὰ στέατα καὶ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ἕως νυκτός καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἡτοίμασαν αὑτοῖς καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν υἱοῖς Ααρων

16 καὶ κατωρθώθη καὶ ἡτοιμάσθη πᾶσα ἡ λειτουργία κυρίου ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ φασεχ καὶ ἐνεγκεῖν τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον κυρίου κατὰ τὴν ἐντολὴν τοῦ βασιλέως Ιωσια
17 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ οἱ εὑρεθέντες τὸ φασεχ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ καὶ τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας
18 καὶ οὐκ ἐγένετο φασεχ ὅμοιον αὐτῷ ἐν Ισραηλ ἀπὸ ἡμερῶν Σαμουηλ τοῦ προφήτου καὶ πάντες βασιλεῖς Ισραηλ οὐκ ἐποίησαν ὡς τὸ φασεχ ὃ ἐποίησεν Ιωσιας καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται καὶ πᾶς Ιουδα καὶ Ισραηλ ὁ εὑρεθεὶς καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τῷ κυρίῳ

20 καὶ ἀνέβη Φαραω Νεχαω βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ τὸν ποταμὸν Εὐφράτην καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ βασιλεὺς Ιωσιας εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ
21 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀγγέλους λέγων τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί βασιλεῦ Ιουδα οὐκ ἐπὶ σὲ ἥκω σήμερον πόλεμον ποιῆσαι καὶ ὁ θεὸς εἶπεν κατασπεῦσαί με πρόσεχε ἀπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ με{T'} ἐμοῦ μὴ καταφθείρῃ σε
