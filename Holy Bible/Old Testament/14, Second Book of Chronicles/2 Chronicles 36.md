# Second Book of Chronicles 36 (RSVCE)

### Reign of Jehoahaz
1 The people of the land took Jehoʹahaz the son of Josiʹah and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem.
2 Jehoʹahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
3 Then the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and laid upon the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
4 And the king of Egypt made Eliʹakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiʹakim; but Neco took Jehoʹahaz his brother and carried him to Egypt.
### Reign and Captivity of Jehoiakim
5 Jehoiʹakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of theLordhis God.
6 Against him came up Nebuchadnezʹzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters to take him to Babylon.
7 Nebuchadnezʹzar also carried part of the vessels of the house of theLordto Babylon and put them in his palace in Babylon.
8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiʹakim, and the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiʹachin his son reigned in his stead.
### Reign and Captivity of Jehoiachin
9 Jehoiʹachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of theLord.
10 In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezʹzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of theLord, and made his brother Zedekiʹah king over Judah and Jerusalem.
### Reign of Zedekiah
11 Zedekiʹah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
12 He did what was evil in the sight of theLordhis God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of theLord.
13 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezʹzar, who had made him swear by God; he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to theLord, the God of Israel.
14 All the leading priests and the people likewise were exceedingly unfaithful, following all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of theLordwhich he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
### The Fall of Jerusalem
15 TheLord, the God of their fathers, sent persistently to them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place;
16 but they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words, and scoffing at his prophets, till the wrath of theLordrose against his people, till there was no remedy.
17 Therefore he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeʹans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or aged; he gave them all into his hand.
18 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of theLord, and the treasures of the king and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.
19 And they burned the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious vessels.
20 He took into exile in Babylon those who had escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and to his sons until the establishment of the kingdom of Persia,
21 to fulfil the word of theLordby the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths. All the days that it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil seventy years.
### Cyrus Proclaims Liberty for the Exiles
22 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of theLordby the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, theLordstirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:
23 “Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘TheLord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may theLordhis God be with him. Let him go up.’ ”


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 36 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Tulit ergo populus terræ Joachaz filium Josiæ, et constituit regem pro patre suo in Jerusalem.
2 Viginti trium annorum erat Joachaz cum regnare cœpisset, et tribus mensibus regnavit in Jerusalem.
3 Amovit autem eum rex Ægypti cum venisset in Jerusalem, et condemnavit terram centum talentis argenti, et talento auri.
4 Constituitque pro eo regem Eliakim fratrem ejus super Judam et Jerusalem, et vertit nomen ejus Joakim: ipsum vero Joachaz tulit secum, et abduxit in Ægyptum.
5 Viginti quinque annorum erat Joakim cum regnare cœpisset, et undecim annis regnavit in Jerusalem: fecitque malum coram Domino Deo suo.
6 Contra hunc ascendit Nabuchodonosor rex Chaldæorum, et vinctum catenis duxit in Babylonem.
7 Ad quam et vasa Domini transtulit, et posuit ea in templo suo.
8 Reliqua autem verborum Joakim, et abominationum ejus quas operatus est, et quæ inventa sunt in eo, continentur in libro regum Juda et Israël. Regnavit autem Joachin filius ejus pro eo.
9 Octo annorum erat Joachin cum regnare cœpisset, et tribus mensibus ac decem diebus regnavit in Jerusalem: fecitque malum in conspectu Domini.
10 Cumque anni circulus volveretur, misit Nabuchodonosor rex, qui adduxerunt eum in Babylonem, asportatis simul pretiosissimis vasis domus Domini. Regem vero constituit Sedeciam patruum ejus super Judam et Jerusalem.

11 Viginti et unius anni erat Sedecias cum regnare cœpisset, et undecim annis regnavit in Jerusalem:
12 fecitque malum in oculis Domini Dei sui, nec erubuit faciem Jeremiæ prophetæ, loquentis ad se ex ore Domini.
13 A rege quoque Nabuchodonosor recessit, qui adjuraverat eum per Deum: et induravit cervicem suam et cor ut non reverteretur ad Dominum Deum Israël.
14 Sed et universi principes sacerdotum et populus prævaricati sunt inique juxta universas abominationes gentium, et polluerunt domum Domini quam sanctificaverat sibi in Jerusalem.
15 Mittebat autem Dominus Deus patrum suorum ad illos per manum nuntiorum suorum de nocte consurgens, et quotidie commonens: eo quod parceret populo et habitaculo suo.
16 At illi subsannabant nuntios Dei, et parvipendebant sermones ejus, illudebantque prophetis, donec ascenderet furor Domini in populum ejus, et esset nulla curatio.
17 Adduxit enim super eos regem Chaldæorum, et interfecit juvenes eorum gladio in domo sanctuarii sui: non est misertus adolescentis, et virginis, et senis, nec decrepiti quidem, sed omnes tradidit in manibus ejus.
18 Universaque vasa domus Domini, tam majora quam minora, et thesauros templi, et regis, et principum, transtulit in Babylonem.
19 Incenderunt hostes domum Dei, destruxeruntque murum Jerusalem: universas turres combusserunt, et quidquid pretiosum fuerat, demoliti sunt.
20 Si quis evaserat gladium, ductus in Babylonem servivit regi et filiis ejus, donec imperaret rex Persarum,
21 et compleretur sermo Domini ex ore Jeremiæ, et celebraret terra sabbata sua: cunctis enim diebus desolationis egit sabbatum usque dum complerentur septuaginta anni.

22 Anno autem primo Cyri regis Persarum, ad explendum sermonem Domini quem locutus fuerat per os Jeremiæ, suscitavit Dominus spiritum Cyri regis Persarum: qui jussit prædicari in universo regno suo, etiam per scripturam, dicens:
23 Hæc dicit Cyrus rex Persarum: Omnia regna terræ dedit mihi Dominus Deus cæli, et ipse præcepit mihi ut ædificarem ei domum in Jerusalem, quæ est in Judæa: quis ex vobis est in omni populo ejus? sit Dominus Deis suus cum eo, et ascendat.

1 καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τὸν Ιωαχαζ υἱὸν Ιωσιου καὶ ἔχρισαν αὐτὸν καὶ κατέστησαν αὐτὸν εἰς βασιλέα ἀντὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
2 υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ τριῶν ἐτῶν Ιωαχαζ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ τρίμηνον ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
3 καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Αμιταλ θυγάτηρ Ιερεμιου ἐκ Λοβενα
4 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον κυρίου κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ
5 καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν Φαραω Νεχαω ἐν Δεβλαθα ἐν γῇ Εμαθ τοῦ μὴ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
6 καὶ μετήγαγεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς Αἴγυπτον καὶ ἐπέβαλεν φόρον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἑκατὸν τάλαντα ἀργυρίου καὶ τάλαντον χρυσίου
7 καὶ κατέστησεν Φαραω Νεχαω τὸν Ελιακιμ υἱὸν Ιωσιου βασιλέα Ιουδα ἀντὶ Ιωσιου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ μετέστρεψεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ιωακιμ καὶ τὸν Ιωαχαζ ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἔλαβεν Φαραω Νεχαω καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς Αἴγυπτον καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ
8 καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον ἔδωκαν τῷ Φαραω τότε ἤρξατο ἡ γῆ φορολογεῖσθαι τοῦ δοῦναι τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ στόμα Φαραω καὶ ἕκαστος κατὰ δύναμιν ἀπῄτει τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον παρὰ τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς δοῦναι τῷ Φαραω Νεχαω
9 ὢν εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν Ιωακιμ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ ἕνδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Ζεχωρα θυγάτηρ Νηριου ἐκ Ραμα καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον κυρίου κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ
10 ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἦλθεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος εἰς τὴν γῆν καὶ ἦν αὐτῷ δουλεύων τρία ἔτη καὶ ἀπέστη ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ

11 ἐτῶν εἴκοσι ἑνὸς Σεδεκιας ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ ἕνδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
12 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον κυρίου θεοῦ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐνετράπη ἀπὸ προσώπου Ιερεμιου τοῦ προφήτου καὶ ἐκ στόματος κυρίου
13 ἐν τῷ τὰ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ναβουχοδονοσορ ἀθετῆσαι ἃ ὥρκισεν αὐτὸν κατὰ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐσκλήρυνεν τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ κατίσχυσεν τοῦ μὴ ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς κύριον θεὸν Ισραηλ
14 καὶ πάντες οἱ ἔνδοξοι Ιουδα καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς ἐπλήθυναν τοῦ ἀθετῆσαι ἀθετήματα βδελυγμάτων ἐθνῶν καὶ ἐμίαναν τὸν οἶκον κυρίου τὸν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
15 καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν ἐν χειρὶ προφητῶν ὀρθρίζων καὶ ἀποστέλλων τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἦν φειδόμενος τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἁγιάσματος αὐτοῦ
16 καὶ ἦσαν μυκτηρίζοντες τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξουδενοῦντες τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐμπαίζοντες ἐν τοῖς προφήταις αὐτοῦ ἕως ἀνέβη ὁ θυμὸς κυρίου ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ ἕως οὐκ ἦν ἴαμα
17 καὶ ἤγαγεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς βασιλέα Χαλδαίων καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν τοὺς νεανίσκους αὐτῶν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἐν οἴκῳ ἁγιάσματος αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐφείσατο τοῦ Σεδεκιου καὶ τὰς παρθένους αὐτῶν οὐκ ἠλέησαν καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους αὐτῶν ἀπήγαγον τὰ πάντα παρέδωκεν ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν
18 καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη οἴκου θεοῦ τὰ μεγάλα καὶ τὰ μικρὰ καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς καὶ πάντας τοὺς θησαυροὺς βασιλέως καὶ μεγιστάνων πάντα εἰσήνεγκεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα
19 καὶ ἐνέπρησεν τὸν οἶκον κυρίου καὶ κατέσκαψεν τὸ τεῖχος Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τὰς βάρεις αὐτῆς ἐνέπρησεν ἐν πυρὶ καὶ πᾶν σκεῦος ὡραῖον εἰς ἀφανισμόν
20 καὶ ἀπῴκισεν τοὺς καταλοίπους εἰς Βαβυλῶνα καὶ ἦσαν αὐτῷ καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ εἰς δούλους ἕως βασιλείας Μήδων
21 τοῦ πληρωθῆναι λόγον κυρίου διὰ στόματος Ιερεμιου ἕως τοῦ προσδέξασθαι τὴν γῆν τὰ σάββατα αὐτῆς σαββατίσαι πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ἐρημώσεως αὐτῆς ἐσαββάτισεν εἰς συμπλήρωσιν ἐτῶν ἑβδομήκοντα

22 ἔτους πρώτου Κύρου βασιλέως Περσῶν μετὰ τὸ πληρωθῆναι ῥῆμα κυρίου διὰ στόματος Ιερεμιου ἐξήγειρεν κύριος τὸ πνεῦμα Κύρου βασιλέως Περσῶν καὶ παρήγγειλεν κηρύξαι ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ ἐν γραπτῷ λέγων
23 τάδε λέγει Κῦρος βασιλεὺς Περσῶν πάσας τὰς βασιλείας τῆς γῆς ἔδωκέν μοι κύριος ὁ θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐνετείλατό μοι οἰκοδομῆσαι αὐτῷ οἶκον ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐκ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ ἔσται ὁ θεὸς αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀναβήτω
