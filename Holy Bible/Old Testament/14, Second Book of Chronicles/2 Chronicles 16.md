# Second Book of Chronicles 16 (RSVCE)

### Alliance with Aram Condemned
1 In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baʹasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
2 Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of theLordand the king’s house, and sent them to Ben-haʹdad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,
3 “Let there be a league between me and you, as between my father and your father; behold, I am sending to you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baʹasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.”
4 And Ben-haʹdad hearkened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Iʹjon, Dan, Aʹbel-maʹim, and all the store-cities of Naphʹtali.
5 And when Baʹasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease.
6 Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baʹasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.
7 At that time Hanaʹni the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you relied on the king of Syria, and did not rely on theLordyour God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped you.
8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with exceedingly many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on theLord, he gave them into your hand.
9 For the eyes of theLordrun to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show his might in behalf of those whose heart is blameless toward him. You have done foolishly in this; for from now on you will have wars.”
10 Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the stocks, in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time.
### Asa’s Disease and Death
11 The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe; yet even in his disease he did not seek theLord, but sought help from physicians.
13 And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign.
14 They buried him in the tomb which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier which had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer’s art; and they made a very great fire in his honor.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 16 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno autem trigesimo sexto regni ejus, ascendit Baasa rex Israël in Judam, et muro circumdabat Rama, ut nullus tute posset egredi et ingredi de regno Asa.
2 Protulit ergo Asa argentum et aurum de thesauris domus Domini, et de thesauris regis, misitque ad Benadad regem Syriæ, qui habitabat in Damasco, dicens:
3 Fœdus inter me et te est; pater quoque meus et pater tuus habuere concordiam: quam ob rem misi tibi argentum et aurum, ut rupto fœdere quod habes cum Baasa rege Israël, facias eum a me recedere.
4 Quo comperto, Benadad misit principes exercituum suorum ad urbes Israël: qui percusserunt Ahion, et Dan, et Abelmaim, et universas urbes Nephthali muratas.
5 Quod cum audisset Baasa, desiit ædificare Rama, et intermisit opus suum.
6 Porro Asa rex assumpsit universum Judam, et tulerunt lapides de Rama, et ligna quæ ædificationi præparaverat Baasa, ædificavitque ex eis Gabaa et Maspha.

7 In tempore illo venit Hanani propheta ad Asa regem Juda, et dixit ei: Quia habuisti fiduciam in rege Syriæ, et non in Domino Deo tuo, idcirco evasit Syriæ regis exercitus de manu tua.
8 Nonne Æthiopes et Libyes multo plures erant quadrigis, et equitibus, et multitudine nimia, quos cum Domino credidisses, tradidit in manu tua?
9 Oculi enim Domini contemplantur universam terram, et præbent fortitudinem his qui corde perfecto credunt in eum. Stulte igitur egisti, et propter hoc ex præsenti tempore adversum te bella consurgent.
10 Iratusque Asa adversus videntem, jussit eum mitti in nervum: valde quippe super hoc fuerat indignatus: et interfecit de populo in tempore illo plurimos.

11 Opera autem Asa prima et novissima scripta sunt in libro regum Juda et Israël.
12 Ægrotavit etiam Asa anno trigesimo nono regni sui, dolore pedum vehementissimo, et nec in infirmitate sua quæsivit Dominum, sed magis in medicorum arte confisus est.
13 Dormivitque cum patribus suis, et mortuus est anno quadragesimo primo regni sui.
14 Et sepelierunt eum in sepulchro suo quod foderat sibi in civitate David: posueruntque eum super lectum suum plenum aromatibus et unguentibus meretriciis, quæ erant pigmentariorum arte confecta, et combusserunt super eum ambitione nimia.

1 καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀγδόῳ καὶ τριακοστῷ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας Ασα ἀνέβη Βαασα βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ ἐπὶ Ιουδαν καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν τὴν Ραμα τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι ἔξοδον καὶ εἴσοδον τῷ Ασα βασιλεῖ Ιουδα
2 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ασα χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον ἐκ θησαυρῶν οἴκου κυρίου καὶ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ Αδερ βασιλέως Συρίας τὸν κατοικοῦντα ἐν Δαμασκῷ λέγων
3 διάθου διαθήκην ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ πατρός μου καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ πατρός σου ἰδοὺ ἀπέσταλκά σοι χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον δεῦρο καὶ διασκέδασον ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ τὸν Βαασα βασιλέα Ισραηλ καὶ ἀπελθέτω ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ
4 καὶ ἤκουσεν υἱὸς Αδερ τοῦ βασιλέως Ασα καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὴν Ιων καὶ τὴν Δαν καὶ τὴν Αβελμαιν καὶ πάσας τὰς περιχώρους Νεφθαλι
5 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι Βαασα ἀπέλιπεν τοῦ μηκέτι οἰκοδομεῖν τὴν Ραμα καὶ κατέπαυσεν τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ Ασα ὁ βασιλεὺς ἔλαβεν πάντα τὸν Ιουδαν καὶ ἔλαβεν τοὺς λίθους τῆς Ραμα καὶ τὰ ξύλα αὐτῆς ἃ ᾠκοδόμησεν Βαασα καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς τὴν Γαβαε καὶ τὴν Μασφα

7 καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἦλθεν Ανανι ὁ προφήτης πρὸς Ασα βασιλέα Ιουδα καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ πεποιθέναι σε ἐπὶ βασιλέα Συρίας καὶ μὴ πεποιθέναι σε ἐπὶ κύριον θεόν σου διὰ τοῦτο ἐσώθη δύναμις Συρίας ἀπὸ τῆς χειρός σου
8 οὐχ οἱ Αἰθίοπες καὶ Λίβυες ἦσαν εἰς δύναμιν πολλὴν εἰς θάρσος εἰς ἱππεῖς εἰς πλῆθος σφόδρα καὶ ἐν τῷ πεποιθέναι σε ἐπὶ κύριον παρέδωκεν εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου
9 ὅτι οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ κυρίου ἐπιβλέπουσιν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ κατισχῦσαι ἐν πάσῃ καρδίᾳ πλήρει πρὸς αὐτόν ἠγνόηκας ἐπὶ τούτῳ ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν ἔσται μετὰ σοῦ πόλεμος
10 καὶ ἐθυμώθη Ασα τῷ προφήτῃ καὶ παρέθετο αὐτὸν εἰς φυλακήν ὅτι ὠργίσθη ἐπὶ τούτῳ καὶ ἐλυμήνατο Ασα ἐν τῷ λαῷ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ

11 καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ λόγοι Ασα οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι γεγραμμένοι ἐν βιβλίῳ βασιλέων Ιουδα καὶ Ισραηλ
12 καὶ ἐμαλακίσθη Ασα ἐν τῷ ἐνάτῳ καὶ τριακοστῷ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ τοὺς πόδας ἕως σφόδρα ἐμαλακίσθη καὶ ἐν τῇ μαλακίᾳ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐζήτησεν κύριον ἀλλὰ τοὺς ἰατρούς
13 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ασα μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν ἐν τῷ ἐνάτῳ καὶ τριακοστῷ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ μνήματι ᾧ ὤρυξεν ἑαυτῷ ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ καὶ ἐκοίμισαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης καὶ ἔπλησαν ἀρωμάτων καὶ γένη μύρων μυρεψῶν καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτῷ ἐκφορὰν μεγάλην ἕως σφόδρα
