# Second Book of Chronicles 15 (RSVCE)

1 The Spirit of God came upon Azariʹah the son of Oded,
2 and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: TheLordis with you, while you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.
3 For a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law;
4 but when in their distress they turned to theLord, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.
5 In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands.
6 They were broken in pieces, nation against nation and city against city, for God troubled them with every sort of distress.
7 But you, take courage! Do not let you hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded.”
8 When Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Azariʹah the son of Oded, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had taken in the hill country of Eʹphraim, and he repaired the altar of theLordthat was in front of the vestibule of the house of theLord.
9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from Eʹphraim, Manasʹseh, and Simeon who were sojourning with them, for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that theLordhis God was with him.
10 They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
11 They sacrificed to theLordon that day, from the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
12 And they entered into a covenant to seek theLord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;
13 and that whoever would not seek theLord, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman.
14 They took oath to theLordwith a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with horns.
15 And all Judah rejoiced over the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and had sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and theLordgave them rest round about.
16 Even Maʹacah, his mother, King Asa removed from being queen mother because she had made an abominable image for Asheʹrah. Asa cut down her image, crushed it, and burned it at the brook Kidron.
17 But the high places were not taken out of Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was blameless all his days.
18 And he brought into the house of God the votive gifts of his father and his own votive gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels.
19 And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 15 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Azarias autem filius Oded, facto in se spiritu Dei,
2 egressus est in occursum Asa, et dixit ei: Audite me, Asa, et omnis Juda et Benjamin: Dominus vobiscum, quia fuistis cum eo. Si quæsieritis eum, invenietis: si autem dereliqueritis eum, derelinquet vos.
3 Transibant autem multi dies in Israël absque Deo vero, et absque sacerdote doctore, et absque lege.
4 Cumque reversi fuerint in angustia sua ad Dominum Deum Israël, et quæsierint eum, reperient eum.
5 In tempore illo, non erit pax egredienti et ingredienti, sed terrores undique in cunctis habitatoribus terrarum:
6 pugnavit enim gens contra gentem, et civitas contra civitatem, quia Dominus conturbabit eos in omni angustia.
7 Vos ergo confortamini, et non dissolvantur manus vestræ: erit enim merces operi vestro.

8 Quod cum audisset Asa, verba scilicet, et prophetiam Azariæ filii Oded prophetæ, confortatus est, et abstulit idola de omni terra Juda et de Benjamin, et ex urbibus quas ceperat, montis Ephraim: et dedicavit altare Domini quod erat ante porticum Domini.
9 Congregavitque universum Judam et Benjamin, et advenas cum eis de Ephraim, et de Manasse, et de Simeon: plures enim ad eum confugerant ex Israël, videntes quod Dominus Deus illius esset cum eo.
10 Cumque venissent in Jerusalem mense tertio, anno decimoquinto regni Asa,
11 immolaverunt Domino in die illa de manubiis et præda quam adduxerant, boves septingentos, et arietes septem millia.
12 Et intravit ex more ad corroborandum fœdus ut quærerent Dominum Deum patrum suorum in toto corde, et in tota anima sua.
13 Si quis autem, inquit, non quæsierit Dominum Deum Israël, moriatur, a minimo usque ad maximum, a viro usque ad mulierem.
14 Juraveruntque Domino voce magna in jubilo, et in clangore tubæ, et in sonitu buccinarum,
15 omnes qui erant in Juda, cum execratione: in omni enim corde suo juraverunt, et in tota voluntate quæsierunt eum, et invenerunt: præstititque eis Dominus requiem per circuitum.

16 Sed et Maacham matrem Asa regis ex augusto deposuit imperio, eo quod fecisset in luco simulacrum Priapi: quod omne contrivit, et in frustra comminuens combussit in torrente Cedron.
17 Excelsa autem derelicta sunt in Israël: attamen cor Asa erat perfectum cunctis diebus ejus,
18 eaque quæ voverat pater suus, et ipse, intulit in domum Domini, argentum, et aurum, vasorumque diversam supellectilem.
19 Bellum vero non fuit usque ad trigesimum quintum annum regni Asa.

1 καὶ Αζαριας υἱὸς Ωδηδ ἐγένετο ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν πνεῦμα κυρίου
2 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν Ασα καὶ παντὶ Ιουδα καὶ Βενιαμιν καὶ εἶπεν ἀκούσατέ μου Ασα καὶ πᾶς Ιουδα καὶ Βενιαμιν κύριος με{Q'} ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ εἶναι ὑμᾶς με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐὰν ἐκζητήσητε αὐτόν εὑρεθήσεται ὑμῖν καὶ ἐὰν ἐγκαταλίπητε αὐτόν ἐγκαταλείψει ὑμᾶς
3 καὶ ἡμέραι πολλαὶ τῷ Ισραηλ ἐν οὐ θεῷ ἀληθινῷ καὶ οὐχ ἱερέως ὑποδεικνύοντος καὶ ἐν οὐ νόμῳ
4 καὶ ἐπιστρέψει ἐπὶ κύριον θεὸν Ισραηλ καὶ εὑρεθήσεται αὐτοῖς
5 καὶ ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ οὐκ ἔστιν εἰρήνη τῷ ἐκπορευομένῳ καὶ τῷ εἰσπορευομένῳ ὅτι ἔκστασις κυρίου ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὰς χώρας
6 καὶ πολεμήσει ἔθνος πρὸς ἔθνος καὶ πόλις πρὸς πόλιν ὅτι ὁ θεὸς ἐξέστησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν πάσῃ θλίψει
7 καὶ ὑμεῖς ἰσχύσατε καὶ μὴ ἐκλυέσθωσαν αἱ χεῖρες ὑμῶν ὅτι ἔστιν μισθὸς τῇ ἐργασίᾳ ὑμῶν

8 καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ τὴν προφητείαν Αδαδ τοῦ προφήτου καὶ κατίσχυσεν καὶ ἐξέβαλεν τὰ βδελύγματα ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς γῆς Ιουδα καὶ Βενιαμιν καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων ὧν κατέσχεν ἐν ὄρει Εφραιμ καὶ ἐνεκαίνισεν τὸ θυσιαστήριον κυρίου ὃ ἦν ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ ναοῦ κυρίου
9 καὶ ἐξεκκλησίασεν τὸν Ιουδαν καὶ Βενιαμιν καὶ τοὺς προσηλύτους τοὺς παροικοῦντας με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ Εφραιμ καὶ ἀπὸ Μανασση καὶ ἀπὸ Συμεων ὅτι προσετέθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πολλοὶ τοῦ Ισραηλ ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν αὐτοὺς ὅτι κύριος ὁ θεὸς αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ
10 καὶ συνήχθησαν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ τρίτῳ ἐν τῷ πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας Ασα
11 καὶ ἔθυσεν τῷ κυρίῳ ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀπὸ τῶν σκύλων ὧν ἤνεγκαν μόσχους ἑπτακοσίους καὶ πρόβατα ἑπτακισχίλια
12 καὶ διῆλθεν ἐν διαθήκῃ ζητῆσαι κύριον θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς
13 καὶ πᾶς ὃς ἐὰν μὴ ἐκζητήσῃ κύριον θεὸν Ισραηλ ἀποθανεῖται ἀπὸ νεωτέρου ἕως πρεσβυτέρου ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς ἕως γυναικός
14 καὶ ὤμοσαν ἐν τῷ κυρίῳ ἐν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ καὶ ἐν σάλπιγξιν καὶ ἐν κερατίναις

16 καὶ τὴν Μααχα τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ μετέστησεν τοῦ μὴ εἶναι τῇ Ἀστάρτῃ λειτουργοῦσαν καὶ κατέκοψεν τὸ εἴδωλον καὶ κατέκαυσεν ἐν χειμάρρῳ Κεδρων
17 πλὴν τὰ ὑψηλὰ οὐκ ἀπέστησαν ἔτι ὑπῆρχεν ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ ἀλ{L'} ἢ καρδία Ασα ἐγένετο πλήρης πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας αὐτοῦ
18 καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν τὰ ἅγια Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ ἅγια οἴκου κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ σκεύη
19 καὶ πόλεμος οὐκ ἦν με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἕως τοῦ πέμπτου καὶ τριακοστοῦ ἔτους τῆς βασιλείας Ασα
