# Second Book of Chronicles 8 (RSVCE)

### Various Activities of Solomon
1 At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of theLordand his own house,
2 Solomon rebuilt the cities which Huram had given to him, and settled the people of Israel in them.
3 And Solomon went to Haʹmath-zoʹbah, and took it.
4 He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store-cities which he built in Hamath.
5 He also built Upper Beth-horʹon and Lower Beth-horʹon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,
6 and Baʹalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
7 All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perʹizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebʹusites, who were not of Israel,
8 from their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed—these Solomon made a forced levy and so they are to this day.
9 But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.
10 And these were the chief officers of King Solomon, two hundred and fifty, who exercised authority over the people.
11 Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the city of David to the house which he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of theLordhas come are holy.”
12 Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to theLordupon the altar of theLordwhich he had built before the vestibule,
13 as the duty of each day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses for the sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual feasts—the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tabernacles.
14 According to the ordinance of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their offices of praise and ministry before the priests as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers in their divisions for the several gates; for so David the man of God had commanded.
15 And they did not turn aside from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries.
16 Thus was accomplished all the work of Solomon from the day the foundation of the house of theLordwas laid until it was finished. So the house of theLordwas completed.
17 Then Solomon went to Eʹzion-geʹber and Eloth on the shore of the sea, in the land of Edom.
18 And Huram sent him by his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea, and they went to Ophir together with the servants of Solomon, and fetched from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 8 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Expletis autem viginti annis postquam ædificavit Salomon domum Domini et domum suam,
2 civitates quas dederat Hiram Salomoni, ædificavit, et habitare ibi fecit filios Israël.
3 Abiit quoque in Emath Suba, et obtinuit eam.
4 Et ædificavit Palmyram in deserto, et alias civitates munitissimas ædificavit in Emath.
5 Exstruxitque Bethoron superiorem, et Bethoron inferiorem, civitates muratas habentes portas et vectes et seras:
6 Balaath etiam et omnes urbes firmissimas quæ fuerunt Salomonis, cunctasque urbes quadrigarum, et urbes equitum. Omnia quæcumque voluit Salomon atque disposuit, ædificavit in Jerusalem, et in Libano, et in universa terra potestatis suæ.
7 Omnem populum qui derelictus fuerat de Hethæis, et Amorrhæis, et Pherezæis, et Hevæis, et Jebusæis, qui non erant de stirpe Israël,
8 de filiis eorum, et de posteris, quos non interfecerant filii Israël, subjugavit Salomon in tributarios, usque in diem hanc.
9 Porro de filiis Israël non posuit ut servirent operibus regis: ipsi enim erant viri bellatores, et duces primi, et principes quadrigarum et equitum ejus.
10 Omnes autem principes exercitus regis Salomonis fuerunt ducenti quinquaginta, qui erudiebant populum.
11 Filiam vero Pharaonis transtulit de civitate David in domum quam ædificaverat ei. Dixit enim rex: Non habitabit uxor mea in domo David regis Israël, eo quod sanctificata sit: quia ingressa est in eam arca Domini.

12 Tunc obtulit Salomon holocausta Domino super altare Domini, quod exstruxerat ante porticum,
13 ut per singulos dies offerretur in eo juxta præceptum Moysi in sabbatis et in calendis, et in festis diebus, ter per annum, id est, in solemnitate azymorum, et in solemnitatem hebdomadarum, et in solemnitate tabernaculorum.
14 Et constituit juxta dispositionem David patris sui officia sacerdotum in ministeriis suis, et Levitas in ordine suo, ut laudarent et ministrarent coram sacerdotibus juxta ritum uniuscujusque diei, et janitores in divisionibus suis per portam et portam: sic enim præceperat David homo Dei.
15 Nec prætergressi sunt de mandatis regis tam sacerdotes quam Levitæ, ex omnibus quæ præceperat, et in custodiis thesaurorum.

16 Omnes impensas præparatas habuit Salomon ex eo die quo fundavit domum Domini usque in diem quo perfecit eam.
17 Tunc abiit Salomon in Asiongaber, et in Ailath ad oram maris Rubri, quæ est in terra Edom.
18 Misit autem ei Hiram per manus servorum suorum naves, et nautas gnaros maris, et abierunt cum servis Salomonis in Ophir, tuleruntque inde quadringenta quinquaginta talenta auri, et attulerunt ad regem Salomonem.


# Παραλειπομένων Βʹ 8 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ εἴκοσι ἔτη ἐν οἷς ᾠκοδόμησεν Σαλωμων τὸν οἶκον κυρίου καὶ τὸν οἶκον ἑαυτοῦ
2 καὶ τὰς πόλεις ἃς ἔδωκεν Χιραμ τῷ Σαλωμων ᾠκοδόμησεν αὐτὰς Σαλωμων καὶ κατῴκισεν ἐκεῖ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ
3 καὶ ἦλθεν Σαλωμων εἰς Αιμαθ Σωβα καὶ κατίσχυσεν αὐτήν
4 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν τὴν Θεδμορ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὀχυράς ἃς ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν Ημαθ
5 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν τὴν Βαιθωρων τὴν ἄνω καὶ τὴν Βαιθωρων τὴν κάτω πόλεις ὀχυράς τείχη πύλαι καὶ μοχλοί
6 καὶ τὴν Βααλαθ καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὀχυράς αἳ ἦσαν τῷ Σαλωμων καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τῶν ἁρμάτων καὶ τὰς πόλεις τῶν ἱππέων καὶ ὅσα ἐπεθύμησεν Σαλωμων κατὰ τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ
7 πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ καταλειφθεὶς ἀπὸ τοῦ Χετταίου καὶ τοῦ Αμορραίου καὶ τοῦ Φερεζαίου καὶ τοῦ Ευαίου καὶ τοῦ Ιεβουσαίου οἳ οὔκ εἰσιν ἐκ τοῦ Ισραηλ
8 ἦσαν ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτῶν τῶν καταλειφθέντων με{T'} αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ γῇ οὓς οὐκ ἐξωλέθρευσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἀνήγαγεν αὐτοὺς Σαλωμων εἰς φόρον ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
9 καὶ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ οὐκ ἔδωκεν Σαλωμων εἰς παῖδας τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἄνδρες πολεμισταὶ καὶ ἄρχοντες καὶ δυνατοὶ καὶ ἄρχοντες ἁρμάτων καὶ ἱππέων
10 καὶ οὗτοι ἄρχοντες τῶν προστατῶν βασιλέως Σαλωμων πεντήκοντα καὶ διακόσιοι ἐργοδιωκτοῦντες ἐν τῷ λαῷ
11 καὶ τὴν θυγατέρα Φαραω Σαλωμων ἀνήγαγεν ἐκ πόλεως Δαυιδ εἰς τὸν οἶκον ὃν ᾠκοδόμησεν αὐτῇ ὅτι εἶπεν οὐ κατοικήσει ἡ γυνή μου ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ τοῦ βασιλέως Ισραηλ ὅτι ἅγιός ἐστιν οὗ εἰσῆλθεν ἐκεῖ κιβωτὸς κυρίου

12 τότε ἀνήνεγκεν Σαλωμων ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ κυρίῳ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ὃ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἀπέναντι τοῦ ναοῦ
13 καὶ κατὰ τὸν λόγον ἡμέρας ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ ἀναφέρειν κατὰ τὰς ἐντολὰς Μωυσῆ ἐν τοῖς σαββάτοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς μησὶν καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς τρεῖς καιροὺς τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ τῶν ἀζύμων καὶ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ τῶν ἑβδομάδων καὶ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ τῶν σκηνῶν
14 καὶ ἔστησεν κατὰ τὴν κρίσιν Δαυιδ τὰς διαιρέσεις τῶν ἱερέων κατὰ τὰς λειτουργίας αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐπὶ τὰς φυλακὰς αὐτῶν τοῦ αἰνεῖν καὶ λειτουργεῖν κατέναντι τῶν ἱερέων κατὰ τὸν λόγον ἡμέρας ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ καὶ οἱ πυλωροὶ κατὰ τὰς διαιρέσεις αὐτῶν εἰς πύλην καὶ πύλην ὅτι οὕτως ἐντολαὶ Δαυιδ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ
15 οὐ παρῆλθον τὰς ἐντολὰς τοῦ βασιλέως περὶ τῶν ἱερέων καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν εἰς πάντα λόγον καὶ εἰς τοὺς θησαυρούς

16 καὶ ἡτοιμάσθη πᾶσα ἡ ἐργασία ἀ{F'} ἧς ἡμέρας ἐθεμελιώθη ἕως οὗ ἐτελείωσεν Σαλωμων τὸν οἶκον κυρίου
17 τότε ᾤχετο Σαλωμων εἰς Γασιωνγαβερ καὶ εἰς τὴν Αιλαθ τὴν παραθαλασσίαν ἐν γῇ Ιδουμαίᾳ
18 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Χιραμ ἐν χειρὶ παίδων αὐτοῦ πλοῖα καὶ παῖδας εἰδότας θάλασσαν καὶ ᾤχοντο μετὰ τῶν παίδων Σαλωμων εἰς Σωφιρα καὶ ἔλαβον ἐκεῖθεν τετρακόσια καὶ πεντήκοντα τάλαντα χρυσίου καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Σαλωμων
