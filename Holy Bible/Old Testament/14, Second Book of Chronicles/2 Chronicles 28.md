# Second Book of Chronicles 28 (RSVCE)

### Reign of Ahaz
1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the eyes of theLord, like his father David,
2 but walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made molten images for the Baʹals;
3 and he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned his sons as an offering, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom theLorddrove out before the people of Israel.
4 And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
### Aram and Israel Defeat Judah
5 Therefore theLordhis God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who defeated him with great slaughter.
6 For Pekah the son of Remaliʹah slew a hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all of them men of valor, because they had forsaken theLord, the God of their fathers.
7 And Zichri, a mighty man of Eʹphraim, slew Ma-aseiʹah the king’s son and Azriʹkam the commander of the palace and Elkaʹnah the next in authority to the king.
### Intervention of Oded
8 The men of Israel took captive two hundred thousand of their kinsfolk, women, sons, and daughters; they also took much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samarʹia.
9 But a prophet of theLordwas there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the army that came to Samarʹia, and said to them, “Behold, because theLord, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand, but you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.
10 And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, as your slaves. Have you not sins of your own against theLordyour God?
11 Now hear me, and send back the captives from your kinsfolk whom you have taken, for the fierce wrath of theLordis upon you.”
12 Certain chiefs also of the men of Eʹphraim, Azariʹah the son of Johaʹnan, Berechiʹah the son of Meshilʹlemoth, Jehizkiʹah the son of Shallum, and Amaʹsa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were coming from the war,
13 and said to them, “You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose to bring upon us guilt against theLordin addition to our present sins and guilt. For our guilt is already great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.”
14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.
15 And the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the captives, and with the spoil they clothed all that were naked among them; they clothed them, gave them sandals, provided them with food and drink, and anointed them; and carrying all the feeble among them on asses, they brought them to their kinsfolk at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samarʹia.
### Assyria Refuses to Help Judah
16 At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help.
17 For the Eʹdomites had again invaded and defeated Judah, and carried away captives.
18 And the Philistines had made raids on the cities in the Shepheʹlah and the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-sheʹmesh, Aiʹjalon, Gedeʹroth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they settled there.
19 For theLordbrought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had dealt wantonly in Judah and had been faithless to theLord.
20 So Tilʹgath-pilneʹser king of Assyria came against him, and afflicted him instead of strengthening him.
21 For Ahaz took from the house of theLordand the house of the king and of the princes, and gave tribute to the king of Assyria; but it did not help him.
### Apostasy and Death of Ahaz
22 In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to theLord—this same King Ahaz.
23 For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, and said, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
24 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and he shut up the doors of the house of theLord; and he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
25 In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, provoking to anger theLord, the God of his fathers.
26 Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
27 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiʹah his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 28 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Viginti annorum erat Achaz cum regnare cœpisset, et sedecim annis regnavit in Jerusalem. Non fecit rectum in conspectu Domini sicut David pater ejus,
2 sed ambulavit in viis regum Israël, insuper et statuas fudit Baalim.
3 Ipse est qui adolevit incensum in valle Benennom, et lustravit filios suos in igne juxta ritum gentium quas interfecit Dominus in adventu filiorum Israël.
4 Sacrificabat quoque, et thymiama succendebat in excelsis, et in collibus, et sub omni ligno frondoso.

5 Tradiditque eum Dominus Deus ejus in manu regis Syriæ, qui percussit eum, magnamque prædam cepit de ejus imperio, et adduxit in Damascum: manibus quoque regis Israël traditus est, et percussus plaga grandi.
6 Occiditque Phacee filius Romeliæ, de Juda centum viginti millia in die uno, omnes viros bellatores: eo quod reliquissent Dominum Deum patrum suorum.
7 Eodem tempore occidit Zechri, vir potens ex Ephraim, Maasiam filium regis, et Ezricam ducem domus ejus, Elcanam quoque secundum a rege.

8 Ceperuntque filii Israël de fratribus suis ducenta millia mulierum, puerorum, et puellarum, et infinitam prædam: pertuleruntque eam in Samariam.
9 Ea tempestate erat ibi propheta Domini, nomine Oded: qui egressus obviam exercitui venienti in Samariam, dixit eis: Ecce iratus Dominus Deus patrum vestrorum contra Juda, tradidit eos in manibus vestris, et occidistis eos atrociter, ita ut ad cælum pertingeret vestra crudelitas.
10 Insuper filios Juda et Jerusalem vultis vobis subjicere in servos et ancillas: quod nequaquam facto opus est: peccastis enim super hoc Domino Deo vestro.
11 Sed audite consilium meum, et reducite captivos quos adduxistis de fratribus vestris, quia magnus furor Domini imminet vobis.
12 Steterunt itaque viri de principibus filiorum Ephraim, Azarias filius Johanan, Barachias filius Mosollamoth, Ezechias filius Sellum, et Amasa filius Adali, contra eos qui veniebant de prælio,
13 et dixerunt eis: Non introducetis huc captivos, ne peccemus Domino. Quare vultis adjicere super peccata nostra, et vetera cumulare delicta? grande quippe peccatum est, et ira furoris Domini imminet super Israël.
14 Dimiseruntque viri bellatores prædam, et universa quæ ceperant, coram principibus, et omni multitudine.
15 Steteruntque viri quos supra memoravimus, et apprehendentes captivos, omnesque qui nudi erant, vestierunt de spoliis: cumque vestissent eos, et calceassent, et refecissent cibo ac potu, unxissentque propter laborem, et adhibuissent eis curam: quicumque ambulare non poterant, et erant imbecillo corpore, imposuerunt eos jumentis, et adduxerunt Jericho civitatem palmarum ad fratres eorum, ipsique reversi sunt in Samariam.

16 Tempore illo misit rex Achaz ad regem Assyriorum, postulans auxilium.
17 Veneruntque Idumæi, et percusserunt multos ex Juda, et ceperunt prædam magnam.
18 Philisthiim quoque diffusi sunt per urbes campestres, et ad meridiem Juda: ceperuntque Bethsames, et Ajalon, et Gaderoth, Socho quoque, et Thamnan, et Gamzo, cum viculis suis, et habitaverunt in eis.
19 Humiliaverat enim Dominus Judam propter Achaz regem Juda, eo quod nudasset eum auxilio, et contemptui habuisset Dominum.
20 Adduxitque contra eum Thelgathphalnasar regem Assyriorum, qui et afflixit eum, et nullo resistente vastavit.
21 Igitur Achaz, spoliata domo Domini, et domo regum ac principum, dedit regi Assyriorum munera, et tamen nihil ei profuit.
22 Insuper et tempore angustiæ suæ auxit contemptum in Dominum, ipse per se rex Achaz,
23 immolavit diis Damasci victimas percussoribus suis, et dixit: Dii regum Syriæ auxiliantur eis, quos ego placabo hostiis, et aderunt mihi: cum e contrario ipsi fuerint ruinæ ei, et universo Israël.
24 Direptis itaque Achaz omnibus vasis domus Dei, atque confractis, clausit januas templi Dei, et fecit sibi altaria in universis angulis Jerusalem.
25 In omnibus quoque urbibus Juda exstruxit aras ad cremandum thus, atque ad iracundiam provocavit Dominum Deum patrum suorum.
26 Reliqua autem sermonum ejus, et omnium operum suorum priorum et novissimorum, scripta sunt in libro regum Juda et Israël.
27 Dormivitque Achaz cum patribus suis, et sepelierunt eum in civitate Jerusalem: neque enim receperunt eum in sepulchra regum Israël. Regnavitque Ezechias filius ejus pro eo.

1 υἱὸς εἴκοσι ἐτῶν Αχαζ ἐν τῷ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτὸν καὶ δέκα ἓξ ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησεν τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον κυρίου ὡς Δαυιδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ ἐπορεύθη κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς βασιλέων Ισραηλ καὶ γὰρ γλυπτὰ ἐποίησεν τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν
3 καὶ ἔθυεν ἐν Γαιβενενομ καὶ διῆγεν τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ διὰ πυρὸς κατὰ τὰ βδελύγματα τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν ἐξωλέθρευσεν κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου υἱῶν Ισραηλ
4 καὶ ἐθυμία ἐπὶ τῶν ὑψηλῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων καὶ ὑποκάτω παντὸς ξύλου ἀλσώδους

8 καὶ ᾐχμαλώτισαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν τριακοσίας χιλιάδας γυναῖκας υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας καὶ σκῦλα πολλὰ ἐσκύλευσαν ἐξ αὐτῶν καὶ ἤνεγκαν τὰ σκῦλα εἰς Σαμάρειαν
9 καὶ ἐκεῖ ἦν ὁ προφήτης τοῦ κυρίου Ωδηδ ὄνομα αὐτῷ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν τῆς δυνάμεως τῶν ἐρχομένων εἰς Σαμάρειαν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἰδοὺ ὀργὴ κυρίου θεοῦ τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τὸν Ιουδαν καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν καὶ ἀπεκτείνατε ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐν ὀργῇ ἕως τῶν οὐρανῶν ἔφθακεν

12 καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἄρχοντες ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Εφραιμ Ουδια ὁ τοῦ Ιωανου καὶ Βαραχιας ὁ τοῦ Μοσολαμωθ καὶ Εζεκιας ὁ τοῦ Σελλημ καὶ Αμασιας ὁ τοῦ Χοδλι ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐρχομένους ἀπὸ τοῦ πολέμου
13 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς οὐ μὴ εἰσαγάγητε τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν ὧδε πρὸς ἡμᾶς ὅτι εἰς τὸ ἁμαρτάνειν τῷ κυρίῳ ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς ὑμεῖς λέγετε προσθεῖναι ἐπὶ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ἡμῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν ἄγνοιαν ὅτι πολλὴ ἡ ἁμαρτία ἡμῶν καὶ ὀργὴ θυμοῦ κυρίου ἐπὶ τὸν Ισραηλ
14 καὶ ἀφῆκαν οἱ πολεμισταὶ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν καὶ τὰ σκῦλα ἐναντίον τῶν ἀρχόντων καὶ πάσης τῆς ἐκκλησίας
15 καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἄνδρες οἳ ἐπεκλήθησαν ἐν ὀνόματι καὶ ἀντελάβοντο τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας καὶ πάντας τοὺς γυμνοὺς περιέβαλον ἀπὸ τῶν σκύλων καὶ ἐνέδυσαν αὐτοὺς καὶ ὑπέδησαν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἔδωκαν φαγεῖν καὶ ἀλείψασθαι καὶ ἀντελάβοντο ἐν ὑποζυγίοις παντὸς ἀσθενοῦντος καὶ κατέστησαν αὐτοὺς εἰς Ιεριχω πόλιν φοινίκων πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς Σαμάρειαν

16 ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀπέστειλεν Αχαζ πρὸς βασιλέα Ασσουρ βοηθῆσαι αὐτῷ
17 καὶ ἐν τούτῳ ὅτι Ιδουμαῖοι ἐπέθεντο καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἐν Ιουδα καὶ ᾐχμαλώτισαν αἰχμαλωσίαν
18 καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπέθεντο ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις τῆς πεδινῆς καὶ ἀπὸ λιβὸς τοῦ Ιουδα καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν Βαιθσαμυς καὶ τὴν Αιλων καὶ τὴν Γαδηρωθ καὶ τὴν Σωχω καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς καὶ τὴν Θαμνα καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς καὶ τὴν Γαμζω καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐκεῖ

20 καὶ ἦλθεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν Θαγλαθφελλασαρ βασιλεὺς Ασσουρ καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτόν
21 καὶ ἔλαβεν Αχαζ τὰ ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου καὶ τὰ ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων καὶ ἔδωκεν τῷ βασιλεῖ Ασσουρ καὶ οὐκ εἰς βοήθειαν αὐτῷ
22 ἀλ{L'} ἢ τῷ θλιβῆναι αὐτὸν καὶ προσέθηκεν τοῦ ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ κυρίου καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς
