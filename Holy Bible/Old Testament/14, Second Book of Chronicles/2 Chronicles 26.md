# Second Book of Chronicles 26 (RSVCE)

### Reign of Uzziah
1 And all the people of Judah took Uzziʹah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziʹah.
2 He built Eloth and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
3 Uzziʹah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliʹah of Jerusalem.
4 And he did what was right in the eyes of theLord, according to all that his father Amaziʹah had done.
5 He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariʹah, who instructed him in the fear of God; and as long as he sought theLord, God made him prosper.
6 He went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.
7 God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabs that dwelt in Gurbaʹal, and against the Me-uʹnites.
8 The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziʹah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong.
9 Moreover Uzziʹah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them.
10 And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shepheʹlah and in the plain, and he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.
11 Moreover Uzziʹah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by Je-iʹel the secretary and Ma-aseiʹah the officer, under the direction of Hananiʹah, one of the king’s commanders.
12 The whole number of the heads of fathers’ houses of mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.
13 Under their command was an army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
14 And Uzziʹah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.
15 In Jerusalem he made engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.
### Pride and Apostasy
16 But when he was strong he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was false to theLordhis God, and entered the temple of theLordto burn incense on the altar of incense.
17 But Azariʹah the priest went in after him, with eighty priests of theLordwho were men of valor;
18 and they withstood King Uzziʹah, and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziʹah, to burn incense to theLord, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary; for you have done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from theLordGod.”
19 Then Uzziʹah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and when he became angry with the priests leprosy broke out on his forehead, in the presence of the priests in the house of theLord, by the altar of incense.
20 And Azariʹah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead! And they thrust him out quickly, and he himself hastened to go out, because theLordhad smitten him.
21 And King Uzziʹah was a leper to the day of his death, and being a leper dwelt in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of theLord. And Jotham his son was over the king’s household, governing the people of the land.
22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziʹah, from first to last, Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz wrote.
23 And Uzziʹah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the burial field which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 26 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Omnis autem populus Juda filium ejus Oziam, annorum sedecim, constituit regem pro Amasia patre suo.
2 Ipse ædificavit Ailath, et restituit eam ditioni Juda, postquam dormivit rex cum patribus suis.
3 Sedecim annorum erat Ozias cum regnare cœpisset, et quinquaginta duobus annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Jechelia de Jerusalem.
4 Fecitque quod erat rectum in oculis Domini, juxta omnia quæ fecerat Amasias pater ejus.
5 Et exquisivit Dominum in diebus Zachariæ intelligentis et videntis Deum: cumque requireret Dominum, direxit eum in omnibus.

6 Denique egressus est, et pugnavit contra Philisthiim, et destruxit murum Geth, et murum Jabniæ, murumque Azoti: ædificavit quoque oppida in Azoto et in Philisthiim.
7 Et adjuvit eum Deus contra Philisthiim, et contra Arabes qui habitabant in Gurbaal, et contra Ammonitas.
8 Appendebantque Ammonitæ munera Oziæ: et divulgatum est nomen ejus usque ad introitum Ægypti propter crebras victorias.
9 Ædificavitque Ozias turres in Jerusalem super portam anguli, et super portam vallis, et reliquas in eodem muri latere, firmavitque eas.
10 Exstruxit etiam turres in solitudine, et effodit cisternas plurimas, eo quod haberet multa pecora tam in campestribus quam in eremi vastitate: vineas quoque habuit et vinitores, in montibus et in Carmelo: erat quippe homo agriculturæ deditus.

11 Fuit autem exercitus bellatorum ejus, qui procedebant ad prælia sub manu Jehiel scribæ, Maasiæque doctoris, et sub manu Hananiæ, qui erat de ducibus regis.
12 Omnisque numerus principum per familias, virorum fortium duorum millium sexcentorum.
13 Et sub eis universus exercitus trecentorum et septem millium quingentorum, qui erant apti ad bella, et pro rege contra adversarios dimicabant.
14 Præparavit quoque eis Ozias, id est, cuncto exercitui, clypeos, et hastas, et galeas, et loricas, arcusque et fundas ad jaciendos lapides.
15 Et fecit in Jerusalem diversi generis machinas, quas in turribus collocavit et in angulis murorum, ut mitterent sagittas, et saxa grandia: egressumque est nomen ejus procul, eo quod auxiliaretur ei Dominus, et corroborasset illum.

16 Sed cum roboratus esset, elevatum est cor ejus in interitum suum, et neglexit Dominum Deum suum: ingressusque templum Domini, adolere voluit incensum super altare thymiamatis.
17 Statimque ingressus post eum Azarias sacerdos, et cum eo sacerdotes Domini octoginta, viri fortissimi,
18 restiterunt regi, atque dixerunt: Non est tui officii, Ozia, ut adoleas incensum Domino, sed sacerdotum, hoc est, filiorum Aaron, qui consecrati sunt ad hujuscemodi ministerium: egredere de sanctuario, ne contempseris: quia non reputabitur tibi in gloriam hoc a Domino Deo.
19 Iratusque Ozias, tenens in manu thuribulum ut adoleret incensum, minabatur sacerdotibus. Statimque orta est lepra in fronte ejus coram sacerdotibus, in domo Domini super altare thymiamatis.
20 Cumque respexisset eum Azarias pontifex, et omnes reliqui sacerdotes, viderunt lepram in fronte ejus, et festinato expulerunt eum. Sed et ipse perterritus, acceleravit egredi, eo quod sensisset illico plagam Domini.

21 Fuit igitur Ozias rex leprosus usque ad diem mortis suæ, et habitavit in domo separata plenus lepra, ob quam ejectus fuerat de domo Domini. Porro Joatham filius ejus rexit domum regis, et judicabat populum terræ.
22 Reliqua autem sermonum Oziæ priorum et novissimorum scripsit Isaias filius Amos propheta.
23 Dormivitque Ozias cum patribus suis, et sepelierunt eum in agro regalium sepulchrorum, eo quod esset leprosus: regnavitque Joatham filius ejus pro eo.

1 καὶ ἔλαβεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τὸν Οζιαν καὶ αὐτὸς δέκα καὶ ἓξ ἐτῶν καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν αὐτὸν ἀντὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Αμασιου
2 αὐτὸς ᾠκοδόμησεν τὴν Αιλαθ αὐτὸς ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτὴν τῷ Ιουδα μετὰ τὸ κοιμηθῆναι τὸν βασιλέα μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ
3 υἱὸς δέκα ἓξ ἐτῶν ἐβασίλευσεν Οζιας καὶ πεντήκοντα καὶ δύο ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Χαλια ἀπὸ Ιερουσαλημ
4 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον κυρίου κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Αμασιας ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ
5 καὶ ἦν ἐκζητῶν τὸν κύριον ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ζαχαριου τοῦ συνίοντος ἐν φόβῳ κυρίου καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἐζήτησεν τὸν κύριον καὶ εὐόδωσεν αὐτῷ κύριος

6 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν καὶ ἐπολέμησεν πρὸς τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους καὶ κατέσπασεν τὰ τείχη Γεθ καὶ τὰ τείχη Ιαβνη καὶ τὰ τείχη Ἀζώτου καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν πόλεις Ἀζώτου καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις
7 καὶ κατίσχυσεν αὐτὸν κύριος ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἄραβας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐπὶ τῆς πέτρας καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς Μιναίους
8 καὶ ἔδωκαν οἱ Μιναῖοι δῶρα τῷ Οζια καὶ ἦν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἕως εἰσόδου Αἰγύπτου ὅτι κατίσχυσεν ἕως ἄνω
9 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν Οζιας πύργους ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τῆς γωνίας καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τῆς φάραγγος καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν γωνιῶν καὶ κατίσχυσεν
10 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν πύργους ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ καὶ ἐλατόμησεν λάκκους πολλούς ὅτι κτήνη πολλὰ ὑπῆρχεν αὐτῷ ἐν Σεφηλα καὶ ἐν τῇ πεδινῇ καὶ ἀμπελουργοὶ ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ καὶ ἐν τῷ Καρμήλῳ ὅτι φιλογέωργος ἦν

11 καὶ ἐγένετο τῷ Οζια δυνάμεις ποιοῦσαι πόλεμον καὶ ἐκπορευόμεναι εἰς παράταξιν εἰς ἀριθμόν καὶ ὁ ἀριθμὸς αὐτῶν διὰ χειρὸς Ιιηλ τοῦ γραμματέως καὶ Μαασαιου τοῦ κριτοῦ διὰ χειρὸς Ανανιου τοῦ διαδόχου τοῦ βασιλέως
12 πᾶς ὁ ἀριθμὸς τῶν πατριαρχῶν τῶν δυνατῶν εἰς πόλεμον δισχίλιοι ἑξακόσιοι
13 καὶ με{T'} αὐτῶν δύναμις πολεμικὴ τριακόσιαι χιλιάδες καὶ ἑπτακισχίλιοι πεντακόσιοι οὗτοι οἱ ποιοῦντες πόλεμον ἐν δυνάμει ἰσχύος βοηθῆσαι τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐπὶ τοὺς ὑπεναντίους
14 καὶ ἡτοίμαζεν αὐτοῖς Οζιας πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει θυρεοὺς καὶ δόρατα καὶ περικεφαλαίας καὶ θώρακας καὶ τόξα καὶ σφενδόνας εἰς λίθους
15 καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ μηχανὰς μεμηχανευμένας λογιστοῦ τοῦ εἶναι ἐπὶ τῶν πύργων καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν γωνιῶν βάλλειν βέλεσιν καὶ λίθοις μεγάλοις καὶ ἠκούσθη ἡ κατασκευὴ αὐτῶν ἕως πόρρω ὅτι ἐθαυμαστώθη τοῦ βοηθηθῆναι ἕως οὗ κατίσχυσεν

16 καὶ ὡς κατίσχυσεν ὑψώθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ τοῦ καταφθεῖραι καὶ ἠδίκησεν ἐν κυρίῳ θεῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν ναὸν κυρίου θυμιάσαι ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῶν θυμιαμάτων
17 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ Αζαριας ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἱερεῖς τοῦ κυρίου ὀγδοήκοντα υἱοὶ δυνατοὶ
18 καὶ ἔστησαν ἐπὶ Οζιαν τὸν βασιλέα καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ οὐ σοί Οζια θυμιάσαι τῷ κυρίῳ ἀλ{L'} ἢ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν υἱοῖς Ααρων τοῖς ἡγιασμένοις θυμιάσαι ἔξελθε ἐκ τοῦ ἁγιάσματος ὅτι ἀπέστης ἀπὸ κυρίου καὶ οὐκ ἔσται σοι τοῦτο εἰς δόξαν παρὰ κυρίου θεοῦ
19 καὶ ἐθυμώθη Οζιας καὶ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὸ θυμιατήριον τοῦ θυμιάσαι ἐν τῷ ναῷ καὶ ἐν τῷ θυμωθῆναι αὐτὸν πρὸς τοὺς ἱερεῖς καὶ ἡ λέπρα ἀνέτειλεν ἐν τῷ μετώπῳ αὐτοῦ ἐναντίον τῶν ἱερέων ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου ἐπάνω τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τῶν θυμιαμάτων
20 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ πρῶτος καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς λεπρὸς ἐν τῷ μετώπῳ καὶ κατέσπευσαν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖθεν καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἔσπευσεν ἐξελθεῖν ὅτι ἤλεγξεν αὐτὸν κύριος

21 καὶ ἦν Οζιας ὁ βασιλεὺς λεπρὸς ἕως ἡμέρας τῆς τελευτῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν οἴκῳ αφφουσωθ ἐκάθητο λεπρός ὅτι ἀπεσχίσθη ἀπὸ οἴκου κυρίου καὶ Ιωαθαμ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ κρίνων τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς
22 καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ λόγοι Οζιου οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι γεγραμμένοι ὑπὸ Ιεσσιου τοῦ προφήτου
23 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Οζιας μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ τῆς ταφῆς τῶν βασιλέων ὅτι εἶπαν ὅτι λεπρός ἐστιν καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωαθαμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
