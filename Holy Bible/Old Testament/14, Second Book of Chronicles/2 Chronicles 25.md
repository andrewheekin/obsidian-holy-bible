# Second Book of Chronicles 25 (RSVCE)

### Reign of Amaziah
1 Amaziʹah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jeho-adʹdan of Jerusalem.
2 And he did what was right in the eyes of theLord, yet not with a blameless heart.
3 And as soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand he killed his servants who had slain the king his father.
4 But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the law, in the book of Moses, where theLordcommanded, “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, or the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.”
### Slaughter of the Edomites
5 Then Amaziʹah assembled the men of Judah, and set them by fathers’ houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those twenty years old and upward, and found that they were three hundred thousand picked men, fit for war, able to handle spear and shield.
6 He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
7 But a man of God came to him and said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for theLordis not with Israel, with all these Eʹphraimites.
8 But if you suppose that in this way you will be strong for war, God will cast you down before the enemy; for God has power to help or to cast down.”
9 And Amaziʹah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?” The man of God answered, “TheLordis able to give you much more than this.”
10 Then Amaziʹah discharged the army that had come to him from Eʹphraim, to go home again. And they became very angry with Judah, and returned home in fierce anger.
11 But Amaziʹah took courage, and led out his people, and went to the Valley of Salt and smote ten thousand men of Seʹir.
12 The men of Judah captured another ten thousand alive, and took them to the top of a rock and threw them down from the top of the rock; and they were all dashed to pieces.
13 But the men of the army whom Amaziʹah sent back, not letting them go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samarʹia to Beth-horʹon, and killed three thousand people in them, and took much spoil.
14 After Amaziʹah came from the slaughter of the Eʹdomites, he brought the gods of the men of Seʹir, and set them up as his gods, and worshiped them, making offerings to them.
15 Therefore theLordwas angry with Amaziʹah and sent to him a prophet, who said to him, “Why have you resorted to the gods of a people, which did not deliver their own people from your hand?”
16 But as he was speaking the king said to him, “Have we made you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be put to death?” So the prophet stopped, but said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”
### Israel Defeats Judah
17 Then Amaziʹah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joʹash the son of Jehoʹahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in the face.”
18 And Joʹash the king of Israel sent word to Amaziʹah king of Judah, “A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son for a wife’; and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle.
19 You say, ‘See, I have smitten Edom,’ and your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness. But now stay at home; why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?”
20 But Amaziʹah would not listen; for it was of God, in order that he might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought the gods of Edom.
21 So Joʹash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziʹah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-sheʹmesh, which belongs to Judah.
22 And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
23 And Joʹash king of Israel captured Amaziʹah king of Judah, the son of Joʹash, son of Ahaziʹah, at Beth-sheʹmesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits, from the Eʹphraim Gate to the Corner Gate.
24 And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God, and Oʹbed-eʹdom with them; he seized also the treasuries of the king’s house, and hostages, and he returned to Samarʹia.
### Death of Amaziah
25 Amaziʹah the son of Joʹash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Joʹash the son of Jehoʹahaz, king of Israel.
26 Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziʹah, from first to last, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?
27 From the time when he turned away from theLordthey made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
28 And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 25 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Viginti quinque annorum erat Amasias cum regnare cœpisset, et viginti novem annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Joadan de Jerusalem.
2 Fecitque bonum in conspectu Domini, verumtamen non in corde perfecto.
3 Cumque roboratum sibi videret imperium, jugulavit servos qui occiderant regem patrem suum,
4 sed filios eorum non interfecit, sicut scriptum est in libro legis Moysi, ubi præcepit Dominus, dicens: Non occidentur patres pro filiis, neque filii pro patribus suis, sed unusquisque in suo peccato morietur.

5 Congregavit igitur Amasias Judam, et constituit eos per familias, tribunosque et centuriones in universo Juda et Benjamin: et recensuit a viginti annis supra, invenitque trecenta millia juvenum qui egrederentur ad pugnam, et tenerent hastam et clypeum:
6 mercede quoque conduxit de Israël centum millia robustorum, centum talentis argenti.
7 Venit autem homo Dei ad illum, et ait: O rex, ne egrediatur tecum exercitus Israël: non est enim Dominus cum Israël, et cunctis filiis Ephraim:
8 quod si putas in robore exercitus bella consistere, superari te faciet Deus ab hostibus: Dei quippe est et adjuvare, et in fugam convertere.
9 Dixitque Amasias ad hominem Dei: Quid ergo fiet de centum talentis, quæ dedi militibus Israël? Et respondit ei homo Dei: Habet Dominus unde tibi dare possit multo his plura.
10 Separavit itaque Amasias exercitum qui venerat ad eum ex Ephraim, ut reverteretur in locum suum: at illi contra Judam vehementer irati, reversi sunt in regionem suam.
11 Porro Amasias confidenter eduxit populum suum, et abiit in vallem Salinarum, percussitque filios Seir decem millia:
12 et alia decem millia virorum ceperunt filii Juda, et adduxerunt ad præruptum cujusdam petræ, præcipitaveruntque eos de summo in præceps: qui universi crepuerunt.
13 At ille exercitus quem remiserat Amasias ne secum iret ad prælium, diffusus est in civitatibus Juda, a Samaria usque ad Bethoron, et interfectis tribus millibus, diripuit prædam magnam.

14 Amasias vero post cædem Idumæorum, et allatos deos filiorum Seir, statuit illos in deos sibi, et adorabat eos, et illis adolebat incensum.
15 Quam ob rem iratus Dominus contra Amasiam misit ad illum prophetam, qui diceret ei: Cur adorasti deos qui non liberaverunt populum suum de manu tua?
16 Cumque hæc ille loqueretur, respondit ei: Num consiliarius regis es? quiesce, ne interficiam te. Discedensque propheta: Scio, inquit, quod cogitaverit Deus occidere te quia fecisti hoc malum, et insuper non acquievisti consilio meo.
17 Igitur Amasias rex Juda inito pessimo consilio, misit ad Joas filium Joachaz filii Jehu regem Israël, dicens: Veni, videamus nos mutuo.
18 At ille remisit nuntios, dicens: Carduus qui est in Libano misit ad cedrum Libani, dicens: Da filiam tuam filio meo uxorem: et ecce bestiæ quæ erant in silva Libani, transierunt, et conculcaverunt carduum.
19 Dixisti: Percussi Edom, et idcirco erigitur cor tuum in superbiam: sede in domo tua: cur malum adversum te provocas, ut cadas et tu, et Juda tecum?
20 Noluit audire Amasias, eo quod Domini esset voluntas ut traderetur in manus hostium propter deos Edom.
21 Ascendit igitur Joas rex Israël, et mutuos sibi præbuere conspectus: Amasias autem rex Juda erat in Bethsames Juda:
22 corruitque Juda coram Israël, et fugit in tabernacula sua.
23 Porro Amasiam regem Juda, filium Joas filii Joachaz, cepit Joas rex Israël in Bethsames, et adduxit in Jerusalem: destruxitque murum ejus a porta Ephraim usque ad portam anguli quadringentis cubitis.
24 Omne quoque aurum et argentum, et universa vasa quæ repererat in domo Dei, et apud Obededom in thesauris etiam domus regiæ, necnon et filios obsidum, reduxit in Samariam.

25 Vixit autem Amasias filius Joas rex Juda, postquam mortuus est Joas filius Joachaz rex Israël, quindecim annis.
26 Reliqua autem sermonum Amasiæ priorum et novissimorum scripta sunt in libro regum Juda et Israël.
27 Qui postquam recessit a Domino, tetenderunt ei insidias in Jerusalem. Cumque fugisset in Lachis, miserunt, et interfecerunt eum ibi.
28 Reportantesque super equos, sepelierunt eum cum patribus suis in civitate David.

1 ὢν πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι ἐτῶν ἐβασίλευσεν Αμασιας καὶ εἴκοσι ἐννέα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ιωαδεν ἀπὸ Ιερουσαλημ
2 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον κυρίου ἀλ{L'} οὐκ ἐν καρδίᾳ πλήρει
3 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς κατέστη ἡ βασιλεία ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ τοὺς φονεύσαντας τὸν βασιλέα πατέρα αὐτοῦ
4 καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν οὐκ ἀπέκτεινεν κατὰ τὴν διαθήκην τοῦ νόμου κυρίου καθὼς γέγραπται ὡς ἐνετείλατο κύριος λέγων οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται πατέρες ὑπὲρ τέκνων καὶ υἱοὶ οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται ὑπὲρ πατέρων ἀλ{L'} ἢ ἕκαστος τῇ ἑαυτοῦ ἁμαρτίᾳ ἀποθανοῦνται

5 καὶ συνήγαγεν Αμασιας τὸν οἶκον Ιουδα καὶ ἀνέστησεν αὐτοὺς κα{T'} οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν εἰς χιλιάρχους καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους ἐν παντὶ Ιουδα καὶ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἠρίθμησεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω καὶ εὗρεν αὐτοὺς τριακοσίας χιλιάδας δυνατοὺς ἐξελθεῖν εἰς πόλεμον κρατοῦντας δόρυ καὶ θυρεόν
6 καὶ ἐμισθώσατο ἀπὸ Ισραηλ ἑκατὸν χιλιάδας δυνατοὺς ἰσχύι ἑκατὸν ταλάντων ἀργυρίου
7 καὶ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἦλθεν πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγων βασιλεῦ οὐ πορεύσεται μετὰ σοῦ δύναμις Ισραηλ ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν κύριος μετὰ Ισραηλ πάντων τῶν υἱῶν Εφραιμ
8 ὅτι ἐὰν ὑπολάβῃς κατισχῦσαι ἐν τούτοις καὶ τροπώσεταί σε κύριος ἐναντίον τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὅτι ἔστιν παρὰ κυρίου καὶ ἰσχῦσαι καὶ τροπώσασθαι
9 καὶ εἶπεν Αμασιας τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τί ποιήσω τὰ ἑκατὸν τάλαντα ἃ ἔδωκα τῇ δυνάμει Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἔστιν τῷ κυρίῳ δοῦναί σοι πλεῖστα τούτων
10 καὶ διεχώρισεν Αμασιας τῇ δυνάμει τῇ ἐλθούσῃ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀπὸ Εφραιμ ἀπελθεῖν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῶν καὶ ἐθυμώθησαν σφόδρα ἐπὶ Ιουδαν καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῶν ἐν ὀργῇ θυμοῦ
11 καὶ Αμασιας κατίσχυσεν καὶ παρέλαβεν τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὴν κοιλάδα τῶν ἁλῶν καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐκεῖ τοὺς υἱοὺς Σηιρ δέκα χιλιάδας
12 καὶ δέκα χιλιάδας ἐζώγρησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ιουδα καὶ ἔφερον αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ κρημνοῦ καὶ κατεκρήμνιζον αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἄκρου τοῦ κρημνοῦ καὶ πάντες διερρήγνυντο
13 καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῆς δυνάμεως οὓς ἀπέστρεψεν Αμασιας τοῦ μὴ πορευθῆναι με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἰς πόλεμον καὶ ἐπέθεντο ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις Ιουδα ἀπὸ Σαμαρείας ἕως Βαιθωρων καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἐν αὐτοῖς τρεῖς χιλιάδας καὶ ἐσκύλευσαν σκῦλα πολλά

14 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ ἐλθεῖν Αμασιαν πατάξαντα τὴν Ιδουμαίαν καὶ ἤνεγκεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς τοὺς θεοὺς υἱῶν Σηιρ καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτοὺς ἑαυτῷ εἰς θεοὺς καὶ ἐναντίον αὐτῶν προσεκύνει καὶ αὐτοῖς αὐτὸς ἔθυεν
15 καὶ ἐγένετο ὀργὴ κυρίου ἐπὶ Αμασιαν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ προφήτας καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ τί ἐζήτησας τοὺς θεοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ οἳ οὐκ ἐξείλαντο τὸν λαὸν αὐτῶν ἐκ χειρός σου
16 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ λαλῆσαι αὐτῷ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ μὴ σύμβουλον τοῦ βασιλέως δέδωκά σε πρόσεχε μὴ μαστιγωθῇς καὶ ἐσιώπησεν ὁ προφήτης καὶ εἶπεν ὅτι γινώσκω ὅτι ἐβούλετο ἐπὶ σοὶ τοῦ καταφθεῖραί σε ὅτι ἐποίησας τοῦτο καὶ οὐκ ἐπήκουσας τῆς συμβουλίας μου
17 καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο Αμασιας καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς Ιωας υἱὸν Ιωαχαζ υἱοῦ Ιου βασιλέα Ισραηλ λέγων δεῦρο ὀφθῶμεν προσώποις
18 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιωας βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ πρὸς Αμασιαν βασιλέα Ιουδα λέγων ὁ αχουχ ὁ ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς τὴν κέδρον τὴν ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ λέγων δὸς τὴν θυγατέρα σου τῷ υἱῷ μου εἰς γυναῖκα καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐλεύσεται τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ τὰ ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ καὶ ἦλθαν τὰ θηρία καὶ κατεπάτησαν τὸν αχουχ
19 εἶπας ἰδοὺ ἐπάταξας τὴν Ιδουμαίαν καὶ ἐπαίρει σε ἡ καρδία ἡ βαρεῖα νῦν κάθησο ἐν οἴκῳ σου καὶ ἵνα τί συμβάλλεις ἐν κακίᾳ καὶ πεσῇ σὺ καὶ Ιουδας μετὰ σοῦ
20 καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν Αμασιας ὅτι παρὰ κυρίου ἐγένετο τοῦ παραδοῦναι αὐτὸν εἰς χεῖρας ὅτι ἐξεζήτησεν τοὺς θεοὺς τῶν Ιδουμαίων
21 καὶ ἀνέβη Ιωας βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ ὤφθησαν ἀλλήλοις αὐτὸς καὶ Αμασιας βασιλεὺς Ιουδα ἐν Βαιθσαμυς ἥ ἐστιν τοῦ Ιουδα
22 καὶ ἐτροπώθη Ιουδας κατὰ πρόσωπον Ισραηλ καὶ ἔφυγεν ἕκαστος εἰς τὸ σκήνωμα
23 καὶ τὸν Αμασιαν βασιλέα Ιουδα τὸν τοῦ Ιωας κατέλαβεν Ιωας βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ ἐν Βαιθσαμυς καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ κατέσπασεν ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους Ιερουσαλημ ἀπὸ πύλης Εφραιμ ἕως πύλης γωνίας τετρακοσίους πήχεις
24 καὶ πᾶν τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ εὑρεθέντα ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου καὶ παρὰ τῷ Αβδεδομ καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν συμμίξεων καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς Σαμάρειαν

25 καὶ ἔζησεν Αμασιας ὁ τοῦ Ιωας βασιλεὺς Ιουδα μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν Ιωας τὸν τοῦ Ιωαχαζ βασιλέα Ισραηλ ἔτη δέκα πέντε
26 καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ λόγοι Αμασιου οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι οὐκ ἰδοὺ γεγραμμένοι ἐπὶ βιβλίου βασιλέων Ιουδα καὶ Ισραηλ
27 καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ᾧ ἀπέστη Αμασιας ἀπὸ κυρίου καὶ ἐπέθεντο αὐτῷ ἐπίθεσιν καὶ ἔφυγεν ἀπὸ Ιερουσαλημ εἰς Λαχις καὶ ἀπέστειλαν κατόπισθεν αὐτοῦ εἰς Λαχις καὶ ἐθανάτωσαν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ
28 καὶ ἀνέλαβον αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῶν ἵππων καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ
