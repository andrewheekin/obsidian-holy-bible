# Second Book of Chronicles 14 (RSVCE)

### Asa Reigns
1 So Abiʹjah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land had rest for ten years.
2 And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of theLordhis God.
3 He took away the foreign altars and the high places, and broke down the pillars and hewed down the Asheʹrim,
4 and commanded Judah to seek theLord, the God of their fathers, and to keep the law and the commandment.
5 He also took out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars. And the kingdom had rest under him.
6 He built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest. He had no war in those years, for theLordgave him peace.
7 And he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities, and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars; the land is still ours, because we have sought theLordour God; we have sought him, and he has given us peace on every side.” So they built and prospered.
8 And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah, armed with bucklers and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand men from Benjamin, that carried shields and drew bows; all these were mighty men of valor.
### Ethiopian Invasion Repulsed
9 Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareʹshah.
10 And Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up their lines of battle in the valley of Zephʹathah at Mareʹshah.
11 And Asa cried to theLordhis God, “OLord, there is none like thee to help, between the mighty and the weak. Help us, OLordour God, for we rely on thee, and in thy name we have come against this multitude. OLord, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.”
12 So theLorddefeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.
13 Asa and the people that were with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians fell until none remained alive; for they were broken before theLordand his army. The men of Judah carried away very much booty.
14 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar, for the fear of theLordwas upon them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them.
15 And they smote the tents of those who had cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 14 (Latin Vulgate)

14:1 Dormivit autem Abia cum patribus suis, et sepelierunt eum in civitate David: regnavitque Asa filius ejus pro eo, in cujus diebus quievit terra annis decem.
2 Fecit autem Asa quod bonum et placitum erat in conspectu Dei sui, et subvertit altaria peregrini cultus, et excelsa.
3 Et confregit statuas, lucosque succidit:
4 et præcepit Judæ ut quæreret Dominum Deum patrum suorum, et faceret legem, et universa mandata:
5 et abstulit de cunctis urbibus Juda aras et fana, et regnavit in pace.
6 Ædificavit quoque urbes munitas in Juda, quia quietus erat, et nulla temporibus ejus bella surrexerant, pacem Domino largiente.
7 Dixit autem Judæ: Ædificemus civitates istas, et vallemus muris, et roboremus turribus, et portis, et seris, donec a bellis quieta sunt omnia, eo quod quæsierimus Dominum Deum patrum nostrorum, et dederit nobis pacem per gyrum. Ædificaverunt igitur, et nullum in exstruendo impedimentum fuit.

8 Habuit autem Asa in exercitu suo portantium scuta et hastas de Juda trecenta millia, de Benjamin vero scutariorum et sagittariorum ducenta octoginta millia: omnes isti viri fortissimi.
9 Egressus est autem contra eos Zara Æthiops cum exercitu suo, decies centena millia, et curribus trecentis: et venit usque Maresa.
10 Porro Asa perrexit obviam ei, et instruxit aciem ad bellum in valle Sephata, quæ est juxta Maresa:
11 et invocavit Dominum Deum, et ait: Domine, non est apud te ulla distantia, utrum in paucis auxilieris, an in pluribus. Adjuva nos, Domine Deus noster: in te enim, et in tuo nomine habentes fiduciam, venimus contra hanc multitudinem. Domine, Deus noster tu es: non prævaleat contra te homo.
12 Exterruit itaque Dominus Æthiopes coram Asa et Juda: fugeruntque Æthiopes.
13 Et persecutus est eos Asa, et populus qui cum eo erat, usque Gerara: et ruerunt Æthiopes usque ad internecionem, quia Domino cædente contriti sunt, et exercitu illius præliante. Tulerunt ergo spolia multa,
14 et percusserunt civitates omnes per circuitum Geraræ: grandis quippe cunctos terror invaserat: et diripuerunt urbes, et multam prædam asportaverunt.
15 Sed et caulas ovium destruentes, tulerunt pecorum infinitam multitudinem, et camelorum: reversique sunt in Jerusalem.


# Παραλειπομένων Βʹ 14 (Septuagint)

14:1 καὶ ἀπέθανεν Αβια μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ασα υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ασα ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ Ιουδα ἔτη δέκα
2 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ καλὸν καὶ τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον κυρίου θεοῦ αὐτοῦ
3 καὶ ἀπέστησεν τὰ θυσιαστήρια τῶν ἀλλοτρίων καὶ τὰ ὑψηλὰ καὶ συνέτριψεν τὰς στήλας καὶ ἐξέκοψεν τὰ ἄλση
4 καὶ εἶπεν τῷ Ιουδα ἐκζητῆσαι τὸν κύριον θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν καὶ ποιῆσαι τὸν νόμον καὶ τὰς ἐντολάς
5 καὶ ἀπέστησεν ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν πόλεων Ιουδα τὰ θυσιαστήρια καὶ τὰ εἴδωλα καὶ εἰρήνευσεν
6 πόλεις τειχήρεις ἐν γῇ Ιουδα ὅτι εἰρήνευσεν ἡ γῆ καὶ οὐκ ἦν αὐτῷ πόλεμος ἐν τοῖς ἔτεσιν τούτοις ὅτι κατέπαυσεν αὐτῷ κύριος
7 καὶ εἶπεν τῷ Ιουδα οἰκοδομήσωμεν τὰς πόλεις ταύτας καὶ ποιήσωμεν τείχη καὶ πύργους καὶ πύλας καὶ μοχλοὺς ἐν ᾧ τῆς γῆς κυριεύσομεν ὅτι καθὼς ἐξεζητήσαμεν κύριον θεὸν ἡμῶν ἐξεζήτησεν ἡμᾶς καὶ κατέπαυσεν ἡμᾶς κυκλόθεν καὶ εὐόδωσεν ἡμῖν

8 καὶ ἐγένετο τῷ Ασα δύναμις ὁπλοφόρων αἰρόντων θυρεοὺς καὶ δόρατα ἐν γῇ Ιουδα τριακόσιαι χιλιάδες καὶ ἐν γῇ Βενιαμιν πελτασταὶ καὶ τοξόται διακόσιαι καὶ πεντήκοντα χιλιάδες πάντες οὗτοι πολεμισταὶ δυνάμεως
9 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς Ζαρε ὁ Αἰθίοψ ἐν δυνάμει ἐν χιλίαις χιλιάσιν καὶ ἅρμασιν τριακοσίοις καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως Μαρισα
10 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ασα εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ καὶ παρετάξατο πόλεμον ἐν τῇ φάραγγι κατὰ βορρᾶν Μαρισης
11 καὶ ἐβόησεν Ασα πρὸς κύριον θεὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν κύριε οὐκ ἀδυνατεῖ παρὰ σοὶ σῴζειν ἐν πολλοῖς καὶ ἐν ὀλίγοις κατίσχυσον ἡμᾶς κύριε ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν ὅτι ἐπὶ σοὶ πεποίθαμεν καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί σου ἤλθαμεν ἐπὶ τὸ πλῆθος τὸ πολὺ τοῦτο κύριε ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν μὴ κατισχυσάτω πρὸς σὲ ἄνθρωπος
12 καὶ ἐπάταξεν κύριος τοὺς Αἰθίοπας ἐναντίον Ιουδα καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ Αἰθίοπες
13 καὶ κατεδίωξεν Ασα καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ ἕως Γεδωρ καὶ ἔπεσον Αἰθίοπες ὥστε μὴ εἶναι ἐν αὐτοῖς περιποίησιν ὅτι συνετρίβησαν ἐνώπιον κυρίου καὶ ἐναντίον τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐσκύλευσαν σκῦλα πολλά
14 καὶ ἐξέκοψαν τὰς κώμας αὐτῶν κύκλῳ Γεδωρ ὅτι ἐγενήθη ἔκστασις κυρίου ἐ{P'} αὐτούς καὶ ἐσκύλευσαν πάσας τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν ὅτι πολλὰ σκῦλα ἐγενήθη αὐτοῖς
15 καί γε σκηνὰς κτήσεων τοὺς Αμαζονεῖς ἐξέκοψαν καὶ ἔλαβον πρόβατα πολλὰ καὶ καμήλους καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ
