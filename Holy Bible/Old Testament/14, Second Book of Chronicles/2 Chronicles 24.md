# Second Book of Chronicles 24 (RSVCE)

### Joash Repairs the Temple
1 Joʹash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; his mother’s name was Zibʹiah of Beer-sheba.
2 And Joʹash did what was right in the eyes of theLordall the days of Jehoiʹada the priest.
3 Jehoiʹada got for him two wives, and he had sons and daughters.
4 After this Joʹash decided to restore the house of theLord.
5 And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that you hasten the matter.” But the Levites did not hasten it.
6 So the king summoned Jehoiʹada the chief, and said to him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses, the servant of theLord, on the congregation of Israel for the tent of testimony?”
7 For the sons of Athaliʹah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God; and had also used all the dedicated things of the house of theLordfor the Baʹals.
8 So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside the gate of the house of theLord.
9 And proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for theLordthe tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought their tax and dropped it into the chest until they had finished.
11 And whenever the chest was brought to the king’s officers by the Levites, when they saw that there was much money in it, the king’s secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and take it and return it to its place. Thus they did day after day, and collected money in abundance.
12 And the king and Jehoiʹada gave it to those who had charge of the work of the house of theLord, and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of theLord, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of theLord.
13 So those who were engaged in the work labored, and the repairing went forward in their hands, and they restored the house of God to its proper condition and strengthened it.
14 And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiʹada, and with it were made utensils for the house of theLord, both for the service and for the burnt offerings, and dishes for incense, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of theLordcontinually all the days of Jehoiʹada.
### Apostasy of Joash
15 But Jehoiʹada grew old and full of days, and died; he was a hundred and thirty years old at his death.
16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.
17 Now after the death of Jehoiʹada the princes of Judah came and did obeisance to the king; then the king harkened to them.
18 And they forsook the house of theLord, the God of their fathers, and served the Asheʹrim and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt.
19 Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to theLord; these testified against them, but they would not give heed.
20 Then the Spirit of God took possession of Zechariʹah the son of Jehoiʹada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them, “Thus says God, ‘Why do you transgress the commandments of theLord, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken theLord, he has forsaken you.’ ”
21 But they conspired against him, and by command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of theLord.
22 Thus Joʹash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiʹada, Zechariʹah’s father, had shown him, but killed his son. And when he was dying, he said, “May theLordsee and avenge!”
### Death of Joash
23 At the end of the year the army of the Syrians came up against Joʹash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.
24 Though the army of the Syrians had come with few men, theLorddelivered into their hand a very great army, because they had forsaken theLord, the God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment on Joʹash.
25 When they had departed from him, leaving him severely wounded, his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiʹada the priest, and slew him on his bed. So he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.
26 Those who conspired against him were Zabad the son of Shimʹe-ath the Ammonitess, and Jehoʹzabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
27 Accounts of his sons, and of the many oracles against him, and of the rebuilding of the house of God are written in the Commentary on the Book of the Kings. And Amaziʹah his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 24 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Septem annorum erat Joas cum regnare cœpisset, et quadraginta annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Sebia de Bersabee.
2 Fecitque quod bonum est coram Domino cunctis diebus Jojadæ sacerdotis.
3 Accepit autem ei Jojada uxores duas, e quibus genuit filios et filias.

4 Post quæ placuit Joas ut instauraret domum Domini.
5 Congregavitque sacerdotes et Levitas, et dixit eis: Egredimini ad civitates Juda, et colligite de universo Israël pecuniam ad sartatecta templi Dei vestri per singulos annos, festinatoque hoc facite. Porro Levitæ egere negligentius.
6 Vocavitque rex Jojadam principem, et dixit ei: Quare tibi non fuit curæ, ut cogeres Levitas inferre de Juda et de Jerusalem pecuniam quæ constituta est a Moyse servo Domini, ut inferret eam omnis multitudo Israël in tabernaculum testimonii?
7 Athalia enim impiissima, et filii ejus, destruxerunt domum Dei, et de universis quæ sanctificata fuerant in templo Domini, ornaverunt fanum Baalim.
8 Præcepit ergo rex, et fecerunt arcam: posueruntque eam juxta portam domus Domini forinsecus.
9 Et prædicatum est in Juda et Jerusalem ut deferrent singuli pretium Domino, quod constituit Moyses servus Dei super omnem Israël in deserto.
10 Lætatique sunt cuncti principes, et omnis populus, et ingressi contulerunt in arcam Domini, atque miserunt ita ut impleretur.
11 Cumque tempus esset ut deferrent arcam coram rege per manus Levitarum (videbant enim multam pecuniam), ingrediebatur scriba regis, et quem primus sacerdos constituerat, effundebantque pecuniam quæ erat in arca, porro arcam reportabant ad locum suum: sicque faciebant per singulos dies. Et congregata est infinita pecunia,
12 quam dederunt rex et Jojada his qui præerant operibus domus Domini: at illi conducebant ex ea cæsores lapidum, et artifices operum singulorum ut instaurarent domum Domini: fabros quoque ferri et æris, ut quod cadere cœperat, fulciretur.
13 Egeruntque hi qui operabantur industrie, et obducebatur parietum cicatrix per manus eorum, ac suscitaverunt domum Domini in statum pristinum, et firmiter eam stare fecerunt.
14 Cumque complessent omnia opera, detulerunt coram rege et Jojada reliquam partem pecuniæ: de qua facta sunt vasa templi in ministerium, et ad holocausta, phialæ quoque, et cetera vasa aurea et argentea: offerebantur holocausta in domo Domini jugiter cunctis diebus Jojadæ.
15 Senuit autem Jojada plenus dierum, et mortuus est cum esset centum triginta annorum:
16 sepelieruntque eum in civitate David cum regibus, eo quod fecisset bonum cum Israël, et cum domo ejus.
17 Postquam autem obiit Jojada, ingressi sunt principes Juda, et adoraverunt regem: qui delinitus obsequiis eorum, acquievit eis.
18 Et dereliquerunt templum Domini Dei patrum suorum, servieruntque lucis et sculptilibus: et facta est ira contra Judam et Jerusalem propter hoc peccatum.
19 Mittebatque eis prophetas ut reverterentur ad Dominum, quos protestantes illi audire nolebant.
20 Spiritus itaque Dei induit Zachariam filium Jojadæ sacerdotem, et stetit in conspectu populi, et dixit eis: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus: Quare transgredimini præceptum Domini, quod vobis non proderit, et dereliquistis Dominum ut derelinqueret vos?
21 Qui congregati adversus eum, miserunt lapides juxta regis imperium in atrio domus Domini.
22 Et non est recordatus Joas rex misericordiæ quam fecerat Jojada pater illius secum, sed interfecit filium ejus. Qui cum moreretur, ait: Videat Dominus, et requirat.

23 Cumque evolutus esset annus, ascendit contra eum exercitus Syriæ: venitque in Judam et Jerusalem, et interfecit cunctos principes populi, atque universam prædam miserunt regi in Damascum.
24 Et certe cum permodicus venisset numerus Syrorum, tradidit Dominus in manibus eorum infinitam multitudinem, eo quod dereliquissent Dominum Deum patrum suorum: in Joas quoque ignominiosa exercuere judicia.
25 Et abeuntes dimiserunt eum in languoribus magnis: surrexerunt autem contra eum servi sui in ultionem sanguinis filii Jojadæ sacerdotis, et occiderunt eum in lectulo suo, et mortuus est: sepelieruntque eum in civitate David, sed non in sepulchris regum.
26 Insidiati vero sunt ei Zabad filius Semaath Ammanitidis, et Jozabad filius Semmarith Moabitidis.
27 Porro filii ejus, ac summa pecuniæ quæ adunata fuerat sub eo, et instauratio domus Dei, scripta sunt diligentius in libro regum: regnavit autem Amasias filius ejus pro eo.

1 ὢν ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν Ιωας ἐν τῷ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτὸν καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Σαβια ἐκ Βηρσαβεε
2 καὶ ἐποίησεν Ιωας τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον κυρίου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Ιωδαε τοῦ ἱερέως
3 καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτῷ Ιωδαε γυναῖκας δύο καὶ ἐγέννησεν υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας

4 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπὶ καρδίαν Ιωας ἐπισκευάσαι τὸν οἶκον κυρίου
5 καὶ συνήγαγεν τοὺς ἱερεῖς καὶ τοὺς Λευίτας καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἐξέλθατε εἰς τὰς πόλεις Ιουδα καὶ συναγάγετε ἀπὸ παντὸς Ισραηλ ἀργύριον κατισχῦσαι τὸν οἶκον κυρίου ἐνιαυτὸν κα{T'} ἐνιαυτὸν καὶ σπεύσατε λαλῆσαι καὶ οὐκ ἔσπευσαν οἱ Λευῖται
6 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ιωας τὸν Ιωδαε τὸν ἄρχοντα καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ διὰ τί οὐκ ἐπεσκέψω περὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν τοῦ εἰσενέγκαι ἀπὸ Ιουδα καὶ Ιερουσαλημ τὸ κεκριμένον ὑπὸ Μωυσῆ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ ὅτε ἐξεκκλησίασεν τὸν Ισραηλ εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου
7 ὅτι Γοθολια ἦν ἡ ἄνομος καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῆς κατέσπασαν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ γὰρ τὰ ἅγια οἴκου κυρίου ἐποίησαν ταῖς Βααλιμ
8 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς γενηθήτω γλωσσόκομον καὶ τεθήτω ἐν πύλῃ οἴκου κυρίου ἔξω
9 καὶ κηρυξάτωσαν ἐν Ιουδα καὶ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ εἰσενέγκαι κυρίῳ καθὼς εἶπεν Μωυσῆς παῖς τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν Ισραηλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ
10 καὶ ἔδωκαν πάντες ἄρχοντες καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς καὶ εἰσέφερον καὶ ἐνέβαλλον εἰς τὸ γλωσσόκομον ἕως οὗ ἐπληρώθη
11 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἰσέφερον τὸ γλωσσόκομον πρὸς τοὺς προστάτας τοῦ βασιλέως διὰ χειρὸς τῶν Λευιτῶν καὶ ὡς εἶδον ὅτι ἐπλεόνασεν τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ γραμματεὺς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ὁ προστάτης τοῦ ἱερέως τοῦ μεγάλου καὶ ἐξεκένωσαν τὸ γλωσσόκομον καὶ κατέστησαν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ οὕτως ἐποίουν ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας καὶ συνήγαγον ἀργύριον πολύ
12 καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ Ιωδαε ὁ ἱερεὺς τοῖς ποιοῦσιν τὰ ἔργα εἰς τὴν ἐργασίαν οἴκου κυρίου καὶ ἐμισθοῦντο λατόμους καὶ τέκτονας ἐπισκευάσαι τὸν οἶκον κυρίου καὶ χαλκεῖς σιδήρου καὶ χαλκοῦ ἐπισκευάσαι τὸν οἶκον κυρίου
13 καὶ ἐποίουν οἱ ποιοῦντες τὰ ἔργα καὶ ἀνέβη μῆκος τῶν ἔργων ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνέστησαν τὸν οἶκον κυρίου ἐπὶ τὴν στάσιν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐνίσχυσαν
14 καὶ ὡς συνετέλεσαν ἤνεγκαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ πρὸς Ιωδαε τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ ἀργυρίου καὶ ἐποίησαν σκεύη εἰς οἶκον κυρίου σκεύη λειτουργικὰ ὁλοκαυτωμάτων καὶ θυίσκας χρυσᾶς καὶ ἀργυρᾶς καὶ ἀνήνεγκαν ὁλοκαυτώσεις ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου διὰ παντὸς πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Ιωδαε
15 καὶ ἐγήρασεν Ιωδαε πλήρης ἡμερῶν καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν ὢν ἑκατὸν καὶ τριάκοντα ἐτῶν ἐν τῷ τελευτᾶν αὐτόν
16 καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ μετὰ τῶν βασιλέων ὅτι ἐποίησεν ἀγαθωσύνην μετὰ Ισραηλ καὶ μετὰ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὴν τελευτὴν Ιωδαε εἰσῆλθον οἱ ἄρχοντες Ιουδα καὶ προσεκύνησαν τὸν βασιλέα τότε ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς
18 καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον τὸν κύριον θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν καὶ ἐδούλευον ταῖς Ἀστάρταις καὶ τοῖς εἰδώλοις καὶ ἐγένετο ὀργὴ ἐπὶ Ιουδαν καὶ ἐπὶ Ιερουσαλημ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ
19 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς προφήτας ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς κύριον καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν καὶ διεμαρτύραντο αὐτοῖς καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν
20 καὶ πνεῦμα θεοῦ ἐνέδυσεν τὸν Αζαριαν τὸν τοῦ Ιωδαε τὸν ἱερέα καὶ ἀνέστη ἐπάνω τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ εἶπεν τάδε λέγει κύριος τί παραπορεύεσθε τὰς ἐντολὰς κυρίου καὶ οὐκ εὐοδωθήσεσθε ὅτι ἐγκατελίπετε τὸν κύριον καὶ ἐγκαταλείψει ὑμᾶς
21 καὶ ἐπέθεντο αὐτῷ καὶ ἐλιθοβόλησαν αὐτὸν δ{I'} ἐντολῆς Ιωας τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν αὐλῇ οἴκου κυρίου
22 καὶ οὐκ ἐμνήσθη Ιωας τοῦ ἐλέους οὗ ἐποίησεν με{T'} αὐτοῦ Ιωδαε ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ὡς ἀπέθνῃσκεν εἶπεν ἴδοι κύριος καὶ κρινάτω

23 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὴν συντέλειαν τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἀνέβη ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν δύναμις Συρίας καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ Ιουδαν καὶ ἐπὶ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ κατέφθειραν πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν τῷ λαῷ καὶ πάντα τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν ἀπέστειλαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Δαμασκοῦ
24 ὅτι ἐν ὀλίγοις ἀνδράσιν παρεγένετο δύναμις Συρίας καὶ ὁ θεὸς παρέδωκεν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν δύναμιν πολλὴν σφόδρα ὅτι ἐγκατέλιπον κύριον θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν καὶ μετὰ Ιωας ἐποίησεν κρίματα
