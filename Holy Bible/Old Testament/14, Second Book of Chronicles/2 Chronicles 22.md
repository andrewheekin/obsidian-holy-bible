# Second Book of Chronicles 22 (RSVCE)

### Ahaziah’s Reign
1 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziʹah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabs to the camp had slain all the older sons. So Ahaziʹah the son of Jehorʹam king of Judah reigned.
2 Ahaziʹah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliʹah, the granddaughter of Omri.
3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in doing wickedly.
4 He did what was evil in the sight of theLord, as the house of Ahab had done; for after the death of his father they were his counselors, to his undoing.
5 He even followed their counsel, and went with Jehorʹam the son of Ahab king of Israel to make war against Hazʹael king of Syria at Raʹmoth-gilʹead. And the Syrians wounded Joram,
6 and he returned to be healed in Jezreʹel of the wounds which he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazʹael king of Syria. And Ahaziʹah the son of Jehorʹam king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreʹel, because he was sick.
7 But it was ordained by God that the downfall of Ahaziʹah should come about through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there he went out with Jehorʹam to meet Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom theLordhad anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
8 And when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, he met the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziʹah’s brothers, who attended Ahaziʹah, and he killed them.
9 He searched for Ahaziʹah, and he was captured while hiding in Samarʹia, and he was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He is the grandson of Jehoshʹaphat, who sought theLordwith all his heart.” And the house of Ahaziʹah had no one able to rule the kingdom.
### Athaliah Seizes the Throne
10 Now when Athaliʹah the mother of Ahaziʹah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family of the house of Judah.
11 But Jeho-shabʹe-ath, the daughter of the king, took Joʹash the son of Ahaziʹah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were about to be slain, and she put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. Thus Jeho-shabʹe-ath, the daughter of King Jehorʹam and wife of Jehoiʹada the priest, because she was a sister of Ahaziʹah, hid him from Athaliʹah, so that she did not slay him;
12 and he remained with them six years, hid in the house of God, while Athaliʹah reigned over the land.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 22 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Constituerunt autem habitatores Jerusalem Ochoziam filium ejus minimum regem pro eo: omnes enim majores natu, qui ante eum fuerant, interfecerant latrones Arabum qui irruerant in castra: regnavitque Ochozias filius Joram regis Juda.
2 Quadraginta duorum annorum erat Ochozias cum regnare cœpisset, et uno anno regnavit in Jerusalem: et nomen matris ejus Athalia filia Amri.
3 Sed et ipse ingressus est per vias domus Achab: mater enim ejus impulit eum ut impie ageret.
4 Fecit igitur malum in conspectu Domini, sicut domus Achab: ipsi enim fuerunt ei consiliarii post mortem patris sui, in interitum ejus:

5 ambulavitque in consiliis eorum. Et perrexit cum Joram filio Achab rege Israël in bellum contra Hazaël regem Syriæ in Ramoth Galaad: vulneraveruntque Syri Joram.
6 Qui reversus est ut curaretur in Jezrahel: multas enim plagas acceperat in supradicto certamine. Igitur Ochozias filius Joram rex Juda descendit ut inviseret Joram filium Achab in Jezrahel ægrotantem.
7 Voluntatis quippe fuit Dei adversus Ochoziam, ut veniret ad Joram: et cum venisset, et egrederetur cum eo adversum Jehu filium Namsi, quem unxit Dominus ut deleret domum Achab.
8 Cum ergo everteret Jehu domum Achab, invenit principes Juda, et filios fratrum Ochoziæ, qui ministrabant ei, et interfecit illos.
9 Ipsum quoque perquirens Ochoziam, comprehendit latitantem in Samaria: adductumque ad se, occidit: et sepelierunt eum, eo quod esset filius Josaphat, qui quæsierat Dominum in toto corde suo.Nec erat ultra spes aliqua ut de stirpe quis regnaret Ochoziæ:
10 siquidem Athalia mater ejus, videns quod mortuus esset filius suus, surrexit, et interfecit omnem stirpem regiam domus Joram.
11 Porro Josabeth filia regis tulit Joas filium Ochoziæ, et furata est eum de medio filiorum regis, cum interficerentur: absconditque eum cum nutrice sua in cubiculo lectulorum: Josabeth autem, quæ absconderat eum, erat filia regis Joram, uxor Jojadæ pontificis, soror Ochoziæ: et idcirco Athalia non interfecit eum.
12 Fuit ergo cum eis in domo Dei absconditus sex annis, quibus regnavit Athalia super terram.

1 καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τὸν Οχοζιαν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν μικρὸν ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ ὅτι πάντας τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ἀπέκτεινεν τὸ λῃστήριον τὸ ἐπελθὸν ἐ{P'} αὐτούς οἱ Ἄραβες καὶ οἱ Αλιμαζονεῖς καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Οχοζιας υἱὸς Ιωραμ βασιλέως Ιουδα
2 ὢν εἴκοσι ἐτῶν Οχοζιας ἐβασίλευσεν καὶ ἐνιαυτὸν ἕνα ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Γοθολια θυγάτηρ Αμβρι
3 καὶ οὗτος ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ οἴκου Αχααβ ὅτι μήτηρ αὐτοῦ ἦν σύμβουλος τοῦ ἁμαρτάνειν
4 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον κυρίου ὡς οἶκος Αχααβ ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἦσαν αὐτῷ μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ σύμβουλοι τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι αὐτόν

5 καὶ ἐν ταῖς βουλαῖς αὐτῶν ἐπορεύθη καὶ ἐπορεύθη μετὰ Ιωραμ υἱοῦ Αχααβ εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ Αζαηλ βασιλέα Συρίας εἰς Ραμα Γαλααδ καὶ ἐπάταξαν οἱ τοξόται τὸν Ιωραμ
6 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ιωραμ τοῦ ἰατρευθῆναι εἰς Ιεζραελ ἀπὸ τῶν πληγῶν ὧν ἐπάταξαν αὐτὸν οἱ Σύροι ἐν Ραμα ἐν τῷ πολεμεῖν αὐτὸν πρὸς Αζαηλ βασιλέα Συρίας καὶ Οχοζιας υἱὸς Ιωραμ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα κατέβη θεάσασθαι τὸν Ιωραμ υἱὸν Αχααβ εἰς Ιεζραελ ὅτι ἠρρώστει
7 καὶ παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐγένετο καταστροφὴ Οχοζια ἐλθεῖν πρὸς Ιωραμ καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν αὐτὸν ἐξῆλθεν με{T'} αὐτοῦ Ιωραμ πρὸς Ιου υἱὸν Ναμεσσι χριστὸν κυρίου τὸν οἶκον Αχααβ
8 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξεδίκησεν Ιου τὸν οἶκον Αχααβ καὶ εὗρεν τοὺς ἄρχοντας Ιουδα καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς Οχοζια λειτουργοῦντας τῷ Οχοζια καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτούς
9 καὶ εἶπεν τοῦ ζητῆσαι τὸν Οχοζιαν καὶ κατέλαβον αὐτὸν ἰατρευόμενον ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν πρὸς Ιου καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτόν καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτόν ὅτι εἶπαν υἱὸς Ιωσαφατ ἐστίν ὃς ἐζήτησεν τὸν κύριον ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν οἴκῳ Οχοζια κατισχῦσαι δύναμιν περὶ τῆς βασιλείας
10 καὶ Γοθολια ἡ μήτηρ Οχοζια εἶδεν ὅτι τέθνηκεν αὐτῆς ὁ υἱός καὶ ἠγέρθη καὶ ἀπώλεσεν πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα τῆς βασιλείας ἐν οἴκῳ Ιουδα
11 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ιωσαβεθ ἡ θυγάτηρ τοῦ βασιλέως τὸν Ιωας υἱὸν Οχοζια καὶ ἔκλεψεν αὐτὸν ἐκ μέσου υἱῶν τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν θανατουμένων καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν καὶ τὴν τροφὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς ταμίειον τῶν κλινῶν καὶ ἔκρυψεν αὐτὸν Ιωσαβεθ θυγάτηρ τοῦ βασιλέως Ιωραμ ἀδελφὴ Οχοζιου γυνὴ Ιωδαε τοῦ ἱερέως καὶ ἔκρυψεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ προσώπου Γοθολιας καὶ οὐκ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτόν
12 καὶ ἦν με{T'} αὐτῆς ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ θεοῦ κατακεκρυμμένος ἓξ ἔτη καὶ Γοθολια ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
