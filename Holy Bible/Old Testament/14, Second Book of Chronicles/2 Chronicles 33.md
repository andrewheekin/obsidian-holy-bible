# Second Book of Chronicles 33 (RSVCE)

### Reign of Manasseh
1 Manasʹseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
2 He did what was evil in the sight of theLord, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom theLorddrove out before the people of Israel.
3 For he rebuilt the high places which his father Hezekiʹah had broken down, and erected altars to the Baʹals, and made Asheʹrahs, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
4 And he built altars in the house of theLord, of which theLordhad said, “In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.”
5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of theLord.
6 And he burned his sons as an offering in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and practiced soothsaying and augury and sorcery, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. He did much evil in the sight of theLord, provoking him to anger.
7 And the image of the idol which he had made he set in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever;
8 and I will no more remove the foot of Israel from the land which I appointed for your fathers, if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them, all the law, the statutes, and the ordinances given through Moses.”
9 Manasʹseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil than the nations whom theLorddestroyed before the people of Israel.
### Manasseh Restored after Repentance
10 TheLordspoke to Manasʹseh and to his people, but they gave no heed.
11 Therefore theLordbrought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasʹseh with hooks and bound him with fetters of bronze and brought him to Babylon.
12 And when he was in distress he entreated the favor of theLordhis God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
13 He prayed to him, and God received his entreaty and heard his supplication and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasʹseh knew that theLordwas God.
14 Afterwards he built an outer wall for the city of David west of Gihon, in the valley, and for the entrance into the Fish Gate, and carried it round Ophel, and raised it to a very great height; he also put commanders of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah.
15 And he took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of theLord, and all the altars that he had built on the mountain of the house of theLordand in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside of the city.
16 He also restored the altar of theLordand offered upon it sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving; and he commanded Judah to serve theLordthe God of Israel.
17 Nevertheless the people still sacrificed at the high places, but only to theLordtheir God.
### Death of Manasseh
18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasʹseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of theLordthe God of Israel, behold, they are in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
19 And his prayer, and how God received his entreaty, and all his sin and his faithlessness, and the sites on which he built high places and set up the Asheʹrim and the images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the Chronicles of the Seers.
20 So Manasʹseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his house; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
### Amon’s Reign and Death
21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
22 He did what was evil in the sight of theLord, as Manasʹseh his father had done. Amon sacrificed to all the images that Manasʹseh his father had made, and served them.
23 And he did not humble himself before theLord, as Manasʹseh his father had humbled himself, but this Amon incurred guilt more and more.
24 And his servants conspired against him and killed him in his house.
25 But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiʹah his son king in his stead.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 33 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Duodecim annorum erat Manasses cum regnare cœpisset, et quinquaginta quinque annis regnavit in Jerusalem.
2 Fecit autem malum coram Domino, juxta abominationes gentium quas subvertit Dominus coram filiis Israël:
3 et conversus instauravit excelsa quæ demolitus fuerat Ezechias pater ejus: construxitque aras Baalim, et fecit lucos, et adoravit omnem militiam cæli, et coluit eam.
4 Ædificavit quoque altaria in domo Domini, de qua dixerat Dominus: In Jerusalem erit nomen meum in æternum.
5 Ædificavit autem ea cuncto exercitui cæli in duobus atriis domus Domini.
6 Transireque fecit filios suos per ignem in valle Benennom: observabat somnia, sectabatur auguria, maleficis artibus inserviebat, habebat secum magos et incantatores, multaque mala operatus est coram Domino ut irritaret eum.
7 Sculptile quoque et conflatile signum posuit in domo Dei, de qua locutus est Deus ad David, et ad Salomonem filium ejus, dicens: In domo hac, et in Jerusalem quam elegi de cunctis tribubus Israël, ponam nomen meum in sempiternum.
8 Et moveri non faciam pedem Israël de terra quam tradidi patribus eorum: ita dumtaxat si custodierint facere quæ præcepi eis, cunctamque legem, et cæremonias atque judicia, per manum Moysi.
9 Igitur Manasses seduxit Judam, et habitatores Jerusalem, ut facerent malum super omnes gentes quas subverterat Dominus a facie filiorum Israël.
10 Locutusque est Dominus ad eum, et ad populum illius, et attendere noluerunt.
11 Idcirco superinduxit eis principes exercitus regis Assyriorum: ceperuntque Manassen, et vinctum catenis atque compedibus duxerunt in Babylonem.
12 Qui postquam coangustatus est, oravit Dominum Deum suum: et egit pœnitentiam valde coram Deo patrum suorum.
13 Deprecatusque est eum, et obsecravit intente: et exaudivit orationem ejus, reduxitque eum Jerusalem in regnum suum, et cognovit Manasses quod Dominus ipse esset Deus.

14 Post hæc ædificavit murum extra civitatem David ad occidentem Gihon in convalle, ab introitu portæ piscium per circuitum usque ad Ophel, et exaltavit illum vehementer: constituitque principes exercitus in cunctis civitatibus Juda munitis:
15 et abstulit deos alienos, et simulacrum de domo Domini: aras quoque, quas fecerat in monte domus Domini et in Jerusalem: et projecit omnia extra urbem.
16 Porro instauravit altare Domini, et immolavit super illud victimas, et pacifica, et laudem: præcepitque Judæ ut serviret Domino Deo Israël.
17 Attamen adhuc populus immolabat in excelsis Domino Deo suo.
18 Reliqua autem gestorum Manasse, et obsecratio ejus ad Deum suum, verba quoque videntium qui loquebantur ad eum in nomine Domini Dei Israël, continentur in sermonibus regum Israël.
19 Oratio quoque ejus et exauditio, et cuncta peccata atque contemptus, loca etiam in quibus ædificavit excelsa, et fecit lucos et statuas antequam ageret pœnitentiam, scripta sunt in sermonibus Hozai.
20 Dormivit ergo Manasses cum patribus suis, et sepelierunt eum in domo sua: regnavitque pro eo filius ejus Amon.

21 Viginti duorum annorum erat Amon cum regnare cœpisset, et duobus annis regnavit in Jerusalem.
22 Fecitque malum in conspectu Domini, sicut fecerat Manasses pater ejus: et cunctis idolis quæ Manasses fuerat fabricatus, immolavit atque servivit.
23 Et non est reveritus faciem Domini, sicut reveritus est Manasses pater ejus, et multo majora deliquit.
24 Cumque conjurassent adversus eum servi sui, interfecerunt eum in domo sua.
25 Porro reliqua populi multitudo, cæsis iis qui Amon percusserant, constituit regem Josiam filium ejus pro eo.

1 ὢν δέκα δύο ἐτῶν Μανασσης ἐν τῷ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτὸν καὶ πεντήκοντα πέντε ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
2 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον κυρίου ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν βδελυγμάτων τῶν ἐθνῶν οὓς ἐξωλέθρευσεν κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ
3 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν τὰ ὑψηλά ἃ κατέσπασεν Εζεκιας ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔστησεν στήλας ταῖς Βααλιμ καὶ ἐποίησεν ἄλση καὶ προσεκύνησεν πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἐδούλευσεν αὐτοῖς
4 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν θυσιαστήρια ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου οὗ εἶπεν κύριος ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά μου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
5 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν θυσιαστήρια πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐν ταῖς δυσὶν αὐλαῖς οἴκου κυρίου
6 καὶ αὐτὸς διήγαγεν τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ ἐν πυρὶ ἐν Γα{I-}βανα{I-}εννομ καὶ ἐκληδονίζετο καὶ οἰωνίζετο καὶ ἐφαρμακεύετο καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐγγαστριμύθους καὶ ἐπαοιδούς ἐπλήθυνεν τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον κυρίου τοῦ παροργίσαι αὐτόν
7 καὶ ἔθηκεν τὸ γλυπτὸν καὶ τὸ χωνευτόν εἰκόνα ἣν ἐποίησεν ἐν οἴκῳ θεοῦ οὗ εἶπεν ὁ θεὸς πρὸς Δαυιδ καὶ πρὸς Σαλωμων υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ καὶ Ιερουσαλημ ἣν ἐξελεξάμην ἐκ πασῶν φυλῶν Ισραηλ θήσω τὸ ὄνομά μου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
8 καὶ οὐ προσθήσω σαλεῦσαι τὸν πόδα Ισραηλ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἧς ἔδωκα τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν πλὴν ἐὰν φυλάσσωνται τοῦ ποιῆσαι πάντα ἃ ἐνετειλάμην αὐτοῖς κατὰ πάντα τὸν νόμον καὶ τὰ προστάγματα καὶ τὰ κρίματα ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ
9 καὶ ἐπλάνησεν Μανασσης τὸν Ιουδαν καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ὑπὲρ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἃ ἐξῆρεν κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου υἱῶν Ισραηλ
10 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος ἐπὶ Μανασση καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐπήκουσαν
11 καὶ ἤγαγεν κύριος ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς δυνάμεως βασιλέως Ασσουρ καὶ κατέλαβον τὸν Μανασση ἐν δεσμοῖς καὶ ἔδησαν αὐτὸν ἐν πέδαις καὶ ἤγαγον εἰς Βαβυλῶνα
12 καὶ ὡς ἐθλίβη ἐζήτησεν τὸ πρόσωπον κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐταπεινώθη σφόδρα ἀπὸ προσώπου θεοῦ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ προσηύξατο πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπήκουσεν τῆς βοῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτὸν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔγνω Μανασσης ὅτι κύριος αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ θεός

14 καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ᾠκοδόμησεν τεῖχος ἔξω τῆς πόλεως Δαυιδ ἀπὸ λιβὸς κατὰ Γιων ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ καὶ ἐκπορευομένων τὴν πύλην τὴν κυκλόθεν καὶ εἰς τὸ Οφλα καὶ ὕψωσεν σφόδρα καὶ κατέστησεν ἄρχοντας τῆς δυνάμεως ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσιν ταῖς τειχήρεσιν ἐν Ιουδα
15 καὶ περιεῖλεν τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους καὶ τὸ γλυπτὸν ἐξ οἴκου κυρίου καὶ πάντα τὰ θυσιαστήρια ἃ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν ὄρει οἴκου κυρίου καὶ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἔξω τῆς πόλεως
16 καὶ κατώρθωσεν τὸ θυσιαστήριον κυρίου καὶ ἐθυσίασεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸ θυσίαν σωτηρίου καὶ αἰνέσεως καὶ εἶπεν τῷ Ιουδα τοῦ δουλεύειν κυρίῳ θεῷ Ισραηλ
17 πλὴν ὁ λαὸς ἔτι ἐπὶ τῶν ὑψηλῶν πλὴν κύριος ὁ θεὸς αὐτῶν
18 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Μανασση καὶ ἡ προσευχὴ αὐτοῦ ἡ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν καὶ λόγοι τῶν ὁρώντων λαλούντων πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐ{P'} ὀνόματι κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ ἰδοὺ ἐπὶ λόγων
19 προσευχῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ὡς ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ ἀποστάσεις αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ τόποι ἐ{F'} οἷς ᾠκοδόμησεν τὰ ὑψηλὰ καὶ ἔστησεν ἐκεῖ ἄλση καὶ γλυπτὰ πρὸ τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι ἰδοὺ γέγραπται ἐπὶ τῶν λόγων τῶν ὁρώντων
20 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Μανασσης μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν παραδείσῳ οἴκου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ Αμων υἱὸς αὐτοῦ

21 ὢν εἴκοσι καὶ δύο ἐτῶν Αμων ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ δύο ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
22 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον κυρίου ὡς ἐποίησεν Μανασσης ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς εἰδώλοις οἷς ἐποίησεν Μανασσης ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἔθυεν Αμων καὶ ἐδούλευσεν αὐτοῖς
23 καὶ οὐκ ἐταπεινώθη ἐναντίον κυρίου ὡς ἐταπεινώθη Μανασσης ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ὅτι υἱὸς αὐτοῦ Αμων ἐπλήθυνεν πλημμέλειαν
24 καὶ ἐπέθεντο αὐτῷ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτὸν ἐν οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ
25 καὶ ἐπάταξεν ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τοὺς ἐπιθεμένους ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Αμων καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τὸν Ιωσιαν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
