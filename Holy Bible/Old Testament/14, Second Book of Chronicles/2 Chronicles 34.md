# Second Book of Chronicles 34 (RSVCE)

### Reign of Josiah
1 Josiʹah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
2 He did what was right in the eyes of theLord, and walked in the ways of David his father; and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.
3 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet a boy, he began to seek the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asheʹrim, and the graven and the molten images.
4 And they broke down the altars of the Baʹals in his presence; and he hewed down the incense altars which stood above them; and he broke in pieces the Asheʹrim and the graven and the molten images, and he made dust of them and strewed it over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
5 He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.
6 And in the cities of Manasʹseh, Eʹphraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naphʹtali, in their ruins round about,
7 he broke down the altars, and beat the Asheʹrim and the images into powder, and hewed down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
### Discovery of the Book of the Law
8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliʹah, and Ma-aseiʹah the governor of the city, and Joʹah the son of Joʹahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of theLordhis God.
9 They came to Hilkiʹah the high priest and delivered the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had collected from Manasʹseh and Eʹphraim and from all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
10 They delivered it to the workmen who had the oversight of the house of theLord; and the workmen who were working in the house of theLordgave it for repairing and restoring the house.
11 They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone, and timber for binders and beams for the buildings which the kings of Judah had let go to ruin.
12 And the men did the work faithfully. Over them were set Jahath and Obadiʹah the Levites, of the sons of Merarʹi, and Zechariʹah and Meshulʹlam, of the sons of the Koʹhathites, to have oversight. The Levites, all who were skilful with instruments of music,
13 were over the burden bearers and directed all who did work in every kind of service; and some of the Levites were scribes, and officials, and gatekeepers.
14 While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of theLord, Hilkiʹah the priest found the book of the law of theLordgiven through Moses.
15 Then Hilkiʹah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of theLord”; and Hilkiʹah gave the book to Shaphan.
16 Shaphan brought the book to the king, and further reported to the king, “All that was committed to your servants they are doing.
17 They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of theLordand have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.”
18 Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, “Hilkiʹah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king.
19 When the king heard the words of the law he rent his clothes.
20 And the king commanded Hilkiʹah, Ahiʹkam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiʹah the king’s servant, saying,
21 “Go, inquire of theLordfor me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that has been found; for great is the wrath of theLordthat is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of theLord, to do according to all that is written in this book.”
### The Prophet Huldah Consulted
22 So Hilkiʹah and those whom the king had sent went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter) and spoke to her to that effect.
23 And she said to them, “Thus says theLord, the God of Israel: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,
24 Thus says theLord, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book which was read before the king of Judah.
25 Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath will be poured out upon this place and will not be quenched.
26 But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of theLord, thus shall you say to him, Thus says theLord, the God of Israel: Regarding the words which you have heard,
27 because your heart was penitent and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and you have humbled yourself before me, and have rent your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, says theLord.
28 Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants.’ ” And they brought back word to the king.
### The Covenant Renewed
29 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
30 And the king went up to the house of theLord, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites, all the people both great and small; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of theLord.
31 And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before theLord, to walk after theLordand to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
32 Then he made all who were present in Jerusalem and in Benjamin stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
33 And Josiʹah took away all the abominations from all the territory that belonged to the people of Israel, and made all who were in Israel serve theLordtheir God. All his days they did not turn away from following theLordthe God of their fathers.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 34 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Octo annorum erat Josias cum regnare cœpisset, et triginta et uno anno regnavit in Jerusalem.
2 Fecitque quod erat rectum in conspectu Domini, et ambulavit in viis David patris sui: non declinavit neque ad dextram, neque ad sinistram.
3 Octavo autem anno regni sui, cum adhuc esset puer, cœpit quærere Deum patris sui David: et duodecimo anno postquam regnare cœperat, mundavit Judam et Jerusalem ab excelsis, et lucis, simulacrisque et sculptilibus.
4 Destruxeruntque coram eo aras Baalim, et simulacra quæ superposita fuerant, demoliti sunt: lucos etiam et sculptilia succidit atque comminuit, et super tumulos eorum qui eis immolare consueverant, fragmenta dispersit.
5 Ossa præterea sacerdotum combussit in altaribus idolorum, mundavitque Judam et Jerusalem.
6 Sed et in urbibus Manasse, et Ephraim, et Simeon, usque Nephthali, cuncta subvertit.
7 Cumque altaria dissipasset, et lucos et sculptilia contrivisset in frustra, cunctaque delubra demolitus esset de universa terra Israël, reversus est in Jerusalem.

8 Igitur anno octavodecimo regni sui, mundata jam terra et templo Domini, misit Saphan filium Eseliæ, et Maasiam principem civitatis, et Joha filium Joachaz a commentariis, ut instaurarent domum Domini Dei sui.
9 Qui venerunt ad Helciam sacerdotem magnum: acceptamque ab eo pecuniam quæ illata fuerat in domum Domini, et quam congregaverant Levitæ, et janitores de Manasse, et Ephraim, et universis reliquiis Israël, ab omni quoque Juda, et Benjamin, et habitatoribus Jerusalem,
10 tradiderunt in manibus eorum qui præerant operariis in domo Domini, ut instaurarent templum, et infirma quæque sarcirent.
11 At illi dederunt eam artificibus et cæmentariis, ut emerent lapides de lapicidinis, et ligna ad commissuras ædificii, et ad contignationem domorum quas destruxerant reges Juda.
12 Qui fideliter cuncta faciebant. Erant autem præpositi operantium Jahath et Abdias de filiis Merari, Zacharias et Mosollam de filiis Caath, qui urgebant opus: omnes Levitæ scientes organis canere.
13 Super eos vero qui ad diversos usus onera portabant, erant scribæ, et magistri de Levitis, janitores.

14 Cumque efferrent pecuniam quæ illata fuerat in templum Domini, reperit Helcias sacerdos librum legis Domini per manum Moysi.
15 Et ait ad Saphan scribam: Librum legis inveni in domo Domini: et tradidit ei.
16 At ille intulit volumen ad regem, et nuntiavit ei, dicens: Omnia quæ dedisti in manu servorum tuorum, ecce complentur.
17 Argentum quod repertum est in domo Domini, conflaverunt, datumque est præfectis artificum, et diversa opera fabricantium.
18 Præterea tradidit mihi Helcias sacerdos hunc librum. Quem cum rege præsente recitasset,

19 audissetque ille verba legis, scidit vestimenta sua:
20 et præcepit Helciæ, et Ahicam filio Saphan, et Abdon filio Micha, Saphan quoque scribæ, et Asaæ servo regis, dicens:
21 Ite, et orate Dominum pro me, et pro reliquiis Israël et Juda, super universis sermonibus libri istius, qui repertus est: magnus enim furor Domini stillavit super nos, eo quod non custodierint patres nostri verba Domini ut facerent omnia quæ scripta sunt in isto volumine.
22 Abiit ergo Helcias, et hi qui simul a rege missi fuerant, ad Oldam prophetidem, uxorem Sellum filii Thecuath filii Hasra custodis vestium, quæ habitabat in Jerusalem in Secunda: et locuti sunt ei verba quæ supra narravimus.
23 At illa respondit eis: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Dicite viro qui misit vos ad me:
24 Hæc dicit Dominus: Ecce ego inducam mala super locum istum et super habitatores ejus, cunctaque maledicta quæ scripta sunt in libro hoc, quem legerunt coram rege Juda.
25 Quia dereliquerunt me, et sacrificaverunt diis alienis, ut me ad iracundiam provocarent in cunctis operibus manuum suarum, idcirco stillabit furor meus super locum istum, et non extinguetur.
26 Ad regem autem Juda, qui misit vos pro Domino deprecando, sic loquimini: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Quoniam audisti verba voluminis,
27 atque emollitum est cor tuum, et humiliatus es in conspectu Dei super his quæ dicta sunt contra locum hunc et habitatores Jerusalem, reveritusque faciem meam scidisti vestimenta tua, et flevisti coram me: ego quoque exaudivi te, dicit Dominus.
28 Jam enim colligam te ad patres tuos, et infereris in sepulchrum tuum in pace: nec videbunt oculi tui omne malum quod ego inducturus sum super locum istum, et super habitatores ejus. Retulerunt itaque regi cuncta quæ dixerat.

29 At ille convocatis universis majoribus natu Juda et Jerusalem,
30 ascendit in domum Domini, unaque omnes viri Juda et habitatores Jerusalem, sacerdotes et Levitæ, et cunctus populus a minimo usque ad maximum. Quibus audientibus in domo Domini, legit rex omnia verba voluminis:
31 et stans in tribunali suo, percussit fœdus coram Domino ut ambularet post eum, et custodiret præcepta, et testimonia, et justificationes ejus in toto corde suo, et in tota anima sua, faceretque quæ scripta sunt in volumine illo, quod legerat.
32 Adjuravit quoque super hoc omnes qui reperti fuerant in Jerusalem et Benjamin: et fecerunt habitatores Jerusalem juxta pactum Domini Dei patrum suorum.

33 Abstulit ergo Josias cunctas abominationes de universis regionibus filiorum Israël: et fecit omnes qui residui erant in Israël, servire Domino Deo suo. Cunctis diebus ejus non recesserunt a Domino Deo patrum suorum.

1 ὢν ὀκτὼ ἐτῶν Ιωσιας ἐν τῷ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτὸν καὶ τριάκοντα ἓν ἔτος ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
2 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ εὐθὲς ἐναντίον κυρίου καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδοῖς Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐξέκλινεν δεξιὰ καὶ ἀριστερά
3 καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀγδόῳ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς ἔτι παιδάριον ἤρξατο τοῦ ζητῆσαι κύριον τὸν θεὸν Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τῷ δωδεκάτῳ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ ἤρξατο τοῦ καθαρίσαι τὸν Ιουδαν καὶ τὴν Ιερουσαλημ ἀπὸ τῶν ὑψηλῶν καὶ τῶν ἄλσεων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν χωνευτῶν
4 καὶ κατέσπασεν κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ τὰ θυσιαστήρια τῶν Βααλιμ καὶ τὰ ὑψηλὰ τὰ ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκοψεν τὰ ἄλση καὶ τὰ γλυπτὰ καὶ τὰ χωνευτὰ συνέτριψεν καὶ ἐλέπτυνεν καὶ ἔρριψεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῶν μνημάτων τῶν θυσιαζόντων αὐτοῖς
5 καὶ ὀστᾶ ἱερέων κατέκαυσεν ἐπὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια καὶ ἐκαθάρισεν τὸν Ιουδαν καὶ τὴν Ιερουσαλημ
6 καὶ ἐν πόλεσιν Εφραιμ καὶ Μανασση καὶ Συμεων καὶ Νεφθαλι καὶ τοῖς τόποις αὐτῶν κύκλῳ
7 καὶ κατέσπασεν τὰ ἄλση καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια καὶ τὰ εἴδωλα κατέκοψεν λεπτὰ καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑψηλὰ ἔκοψεν ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς γῆς Ισραηλ καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ

8 καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ τοῦ καθαρίσαι τὴν γῆν καὶ τὸν οἶκον ἀπέστειλεν τὸν Σαφαν υἱὸν Εσελια καὶ τὸν Μαασιαν ἄρχοντα τῆς πόλεως καὶ τὸν Ιουαχ υἱὸν Ιωαχαζ τὸν ὑπομνηματογράφον αὐτοῦ κραταιῶσαι τὸν οἶκον κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ
9 καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς Χελκιαν τὸν ἱερέα τὸν μέγαν καὶ ἔδωκαν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εἰσενεχθὲν εἰς οἶκον θεοῦ ὃ συνήγαγον οἱ Λευῖται φυλάσσοντες τὴν πύλην ἐκ χειρὸς Μανασση καὶ Εφραιμ καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων καὶ ἀπὸ παντὸς καταλοίπου ἐν Ισραηλ καὶ υἱῶν Ιουδα καὶ Βενιαμιν καὶ οἰκούντων ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
10 καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ χεῖρα ποιούντων τὰ ἔργα οἱ καθεσταμένοι ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτὸ ποιοῦσι τὰ ἔργα οἳ ἐποίουν ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου ἐπισκευάσαι κατισχῦσαι τὸν οἶκον
11 καὶ ἔδωκαν τοῖς τέκτοσι καὶ τοῖς οἰκοδόμοις ἀγοράσαι λίθους τετραπέδους καὶ ξύλα εἰς δοκοὺς στεγάσαι τοὺς οἴκους οὓς ἐξωλέθρευσαν βασιλεῖς Ιουδα
12 καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες ἐν πίστει ἐπὶ τῶν ἔργων καὶ ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν ἐπίσκοποι Ιεθ καὶ Αβδιας οἱ Λευῖται ἐξ υἱῶν Μεραρι καὶ Ζαχαριας καὶ Μοσολλαμ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Κααθ ἐπισκοπεῖν καὶ πᾶς Λευίτης πᾶς συνίων ἐν ὀργάνοις ᾠδῶν
13 καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν νωτοφόρων καὶ ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν ποιούντων τὰ ἔργα ἐργασίᾳ καὶ ἐργασίᾳ καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν Λευιτῶν γραμματεῖς καὶ κριταὶ καὶ πυλωροί

14 καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐκφέρειν αὐτοὺς τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εἰσοδιασθὲν εἰς οἶκον κυρίου εὗρεν Χελκιας ὁ ἱερεὺς βιβλίον νόμου κυρίου διὰ χειρὸς Μωυσῆ
15 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Χελκιας καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Σαφαν τὸν γραμματέα βιβλίον νόμου εὗρον ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου καὶ ἔδωκεν Χελκιας τὸ βιβλίον τῷ Σαφαν
16 καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν Σαφαν τὸ βιβλίον πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ ἀπέδωκεν ἔτι τῷ βασιλεῖ λόγον πᾶν τὸ δοθὲν ἀργύριον ἐν χειρὶ τῶν παίδων σου τῶν ποιούντων τὸ ἔργον
17 καὶ ἐχώνευσαν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου καὶ ἔδωκαν ἐπὶ χεῖρα τῶν ἐπισκόπων καὶ ἐπὶ χεῖρα τῶν ποιούντων ἐργασίαν
18 καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν Σαφαν ὁ γραμματεὺς τῷ βασιλεῖ λέγων βιβλίον ἔδωκέν μοι Χελκιας ὁ ἱερεύς καὶ ἀνέγνω αὐτὸ Σαφαν ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως

19 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς λόγους τοῦ νόμου καὶ διέρρηξεν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ
20 καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Χελκια καὶ τῷ Αχικαμ υἱῷ Σαφαν καὶ τῷ Αβδων υἱῷ Μιχαια καὶ τῷ Σαφαν τῷ γραμματεῖ καὶ τῷ Ασαια παιδὶ τοῦ βασιλέως λέγων
21 πορεύθητε ζητήσατε τὸν κύριον περὶ ἐμοῦ καὶ περὶ παντὸς τοῦ καταλειφθέντος ἐν Ισραηλ καὶ Ιουδα περὶ τῶν λόγων τοῦ βιβλίου τοῦ εὑρεθέντος ὅτι μέγας ὁ θυμὸς κυρίου ἐκκέκαυται ἐν ἡμῖν διότι οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν τῶν λόγων κυρίου τοῦ ποιῆσαι κατὰ πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τούτῳ
22 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Χελκιας καὶ οἷς εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Ολδαν τὴν προφῆτιν γυναῖκα Σελλημ υἱοῦ Θακουαθ υἱοῦ Χελλης φυλάσσουσαν τὰς στολάς καὶ αὕτη κατῴκει ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἐν μασανα καὶ ἐλάλησαν αὐτῇ κατὰ ταῦτα
23 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς οὕτως εἶπεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ εἴπατε τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ ἀποστείλαντι ὑμᾶς πρός με
24 οὕτως λέγει κύριος ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω κακὰ ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον τοὺς πάντας λόγους τοὺς γεγραμμένους ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τῷ ἀνεγνωσμένῳ ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως Ιουδα
25 ἀν{Q'} ὧν ἐγκατέλιπόν με καὶ ἐθυμίασαν θεοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις ἵνα παροργίσωσίν με ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐξεκαύθη ὁ θυμός μου ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ καὶ οὐ σβεσθήσεται
26 καὶ ἐπὶ βασιλέα Ιουδα τὸν ἀποστείλαντα ὑμᾶς τοῦ ζητῆσαι τὸν κύριον οὕτως ἐρεῖτε αὐτῷ οὕτως λέγει κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἤκουσας
27 καὶ ἐνετράπη ἡ καρδία σου καὶ ἐταπεινώθης ἀπὸ προσώπου μου ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαί σε τοὺς λόγους μου ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας αὐτὸν καὶ ἐταπεινώθης ἐναντίον μου καὶ διέρρηξας τὰ ἱμάτιά σου καὶ ἔκλαυσας κατεναντίον μου καὶ ἐγὼ ἤκουσά φησιν κύριος
28 ἰδοὺ προστίθημί σε πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας σου καὶ προστεθήσῃ πρὸς τὰ μνήματά σου ἐν εἰρήνῃ καὶ οὐκ ὄψονται οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς κακοῖς οἷς ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας αὐτόν καὶ ἀπέδωκαν τῷ βασιλεῖ λόγον

29 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ συνήγαγεν τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ιουδα καὶ Ιερουσαλημ
30 καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς οἶκον κυρίου καὶ πᾶς Ιουδα καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ιερουσαλημ καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἀπὸ μεγάλου ἕως μικροῦ καὶ ἀνέγνω ἐν ὠσὶν αὐτῶν τοὺς πάντας λόγους βιβλίου τῆς διαθήκης τοῦ εὑρεθέντος ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου
31 καὶ ἔστη ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τὸν στῦλον καὶ διέθετο διαθήκην ἐναντίον κυρίου τοῦ πορευθῆναι ἐνώπιον κυρίου τοῦ φυλάσσειν τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ καὶ μαρτύρια αὐτοῦ καὶ προστάγματα αὐτοῦ ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ ψυχῇ τοὺς λόγους τῆς διαθήκης τοὺς γεγραμμένους ἐπὶ τῷ βιβλίῳ τούτῳ
32 καὶ ἔστησεν πάντας τοὺς εὑρεθέντας ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ Βενιαμιν καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ιερουσαλημ διαθήκην ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου θεοῦ πατέρων αὐτῶν

33 καὶ περιεῖλεν Ιωσιας τὰ πάντα βδελύγματα ἐκ πάσης τῆς γῆς ἣ ἦν υἱῶν Ισραηλ καὶ ἐποίησεν πάντας τοὺς εὑρεθέντας ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐν Ισραηλ τοῦ δουλεύειν κυρίῳ θεῷ αὐτῶν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐξέκλινεν ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν κυρίου θεοῦ πατέρων αὐτοῦ
