# Second Book of Chronicles 21 (RSVCE)

### Jehoram’s Reign
1 Jehoshʹaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Jehorʹam his son reigned in his stead.
2 He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshʹaphat: Azariʹah, Jehiʹel, Zechariʹah, Azariʹah, Michael, and Shephatiʹah; all these were the sons of Jehoshʹaphat king of Judah.
3 Their father gave them great gifts, of silver, gold, and valuable possessions, together with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehorʹam, because he was the first-born.
4 When Jehorʹam had ascended the throne of his father and was established, he slew all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel.
5 Jehorʹam was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done; for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord.
7 Yet theLordwould not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant which he had made with David, and since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons for ever.
### Revolt of Edom
8 In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah, and set up a king of their own.
9 Then Jehorʹam passed over with his commanders and all his chariots, and he rose by night and smote the Eʹdomites who had surrounded him and his chariot commanders.
10 So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah also revolted from his rule, because he had forsaken theLord, the God of his fathers.
### Elijah’s Letter
11 Moreover he made high places in the hill country of Judah, and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness, and made Judah go astray.
12 And a letter came to him from Eliʹjah the prophet, saying, “Thus says theLord, the God of David your father, ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshʹaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
13 but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness, as the house of Ahab led Israel into unfaithfulness, and also you have killed your brothers, of your father’s house, who were better than yourself;
14 behold, theLordwill bring a great plague on your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions,
15 and you yourself will have a severe sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the disease, day by day.’ ”
16 And theLordstirred up against Jehorʹam the anger of the Philistines and of the Arabs who are near the Ethiopians;
17 and they came up against Judah, and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions they found that belonged to the king’s house, and also his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoʹahaz, his youngest son.
### Disease and Death of Jehoram
18 And after all this theLordsmote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
19 In course of time, at the end of two years, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great agony. His people made no fire in his honor, like the fires made for his fathers.
20 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem; and he departed with no one’s regret. They buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 21 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dormivit autem Josaphat cum patribus suis, et sepultus est cum eis in civitate David: regnavitque Joram filius ejus pro eo.
2 Qui habuit fratres filios Josaphat, Azariam, et Jahiel, et Zachariam, et Azariam, et Michaël, et Saphatiam: omnes hi filii Josaphat regis Juda.
3 Deditque eis pater suus multa munera argenti et auri, et pensitationes, cum civitatibus munitissimis in Juda: regnum autem tradidit Joram, eo quod esset primogenitus.
4 Surrexit ergo Joram super regnum patris sui: cumque se confirmasset, occidit omnes fratres suos gladio, et quosdam de principibus Israël.

5 Triginta duorum annorum erat Joram cum regnare cœpisset, et octo annis regnavit in Jerusalem.
6 Ambulavitque in viis regum Israël, sicut egerat domus Achab: filia quippe Achab erat uxor ejus: et fecit malum in conspectu Domini.
7 Noluit autem Dominus disperdere domum David propter pactum quod inierat cum eo: et quia promiserat ut daret ei lucernam, et filiis ejus omni tempore.
8 In diebus illis rebellavit Edom, ne esset subditus Judæ, et constituit sibi regem.
9 Cumque transisset Joram cum principibus suis, et cuncto equitatu qui erat secum, surrexit nocte, et percussit Edom, qui se circumdederat, et omnes duces equitatus ejus.
10 Attamen rebellavit Edom, ne esset sub ditione Juda usque ad hanc diem: eo tempore et Lobna recessit ne esset sub manu illius. Dereliquerat enim Dominum Deum patrum suorum:
11 insuper et excelsa fabricatus est in urbibus Juda, et fornicari fecit habitatores Jerusalem, et prævaricari Judam.

12 Allatæ sunt autem ei litteræ ab Elia propheta, in quibus scriptum erat: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus David patris tui: Quoniam non ambulasti in viis Josaphat patris tui, et in viis Asa regis Juda,
13 sed incessisti per iter regum Israël, et fornicari fecisti Judam et habitatores Jerusalem, imitatus fornicationem domus Achab, insuper et fratres tuos, domum patris tui, meliores te, occidisti:
14 ecce Dominus percutiet te plaga magna cum populo tuo, et filiis, et uxoribus tuis, universaque substantia tua.
15 Tu autem ægrotabis pessimo languore uteri tui, donec egrediantur vitalia tua paulatim per singulos dies.

16 Suscitavit ergo Dominus contra Joram spiritum Philisthinorum, et Arabum qui confines sunt Æthiopibus:
17 et ascenderunt in terram Juda, et vastaverunt eam, diripueruntque cunctam substantiam quæ inventa est in domo regis, insuper et filios ejus, et uxores: nec remansit ei filius, nisi Joachaz, qui minimus natu erat.
18 Et super hæc omnia percussit eum Dominus alvi languore insanabili.
19 Cumque diei succederet dies, et temporum spatia volverentur, duorum annorum expletus est circulus: et sic longa consumptus tabe, ita ut egereret etiam viscera sua, languore pariter, et vita caruit. Mortuusque est in infirmitate pessima, et non fecit ei populus secundum morem combustionis exequias, sicut fecerat majoribus ejus.
20 Triginta duorum annorum fuit cum regnare cœpisset, et octo annis regnavit in Jerusalem. Ambulavitque non recte, et sepelierunt eum in civitate David, verumtamen non in sepulchro regum.


# Παραλειπομένων Βʹ 21 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ιωσαφατ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐτάφη παρὰ τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωραμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ αὐτῷ ἀδελφοὶ υἱοὶ Ιωσαφατ ἕξ Αζαριας καὶ Ιιηλ καὶ Ζαχαριας καὶ Αζαριας καὶ Μιχαηλ καὶ Σαφατιας πάντες οὗτοι υἱοὶ Ιωσαφατ βασιλέως Ιουδα
3 καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν δόματα πολλά ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ ὅπλα μετὰ πόλεων τετειχισμένων ἐν Ιουδα καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν ἔδωκεν τῷ Ιωραμ ὅτι οὗτος ὁ πρωτότοκος
4 καὶ ἀνέστη Ιωραμ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκραταιώθη καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν πάντας τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχόντων Ισραηλ

5 ὄντος αὐτοῦ τριάκοντα καὶ δύο ἐτῶν κατέστη Ιωραμ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ὀκτὼ ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
6 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ βασιλέων Ισραηλ ὡς ἐποίησεν οἶκος Αχααβ ὅτι θυγάτηρ Αχααβ ἦν αὐτοῦ γυνή καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον κυρίου
7 καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλετο κύριος ἐξολεθρεῦσαι τὸν οἶκον Δαυιδ διὰ τὴν διαθήκην ἣν διέθετο τῷ Δαυιδ καὶ ὡς εἶπεν αὐτῷ δοῦναι αὐτῷ λύχνον καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
8 ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἀπέστη Εδωμ ἀπὸ τοῦ Ιουδα καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν ἐ{F'} ἑαυτοὺς βασιλέα
9 καὶ ᾤχετο Ιωραμ μετὰ τῶν ἀρχόντων καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἵππος με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγένετο καὶ ἠγέρθη νυκτὸς καὶ ἐπάταξεν Εδωμ τὸν κυκλοῦντα αὐτὸν καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν ἁρμάτων καὶ ἔφυγεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτῶν
10 καὶ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ Ιουδα Εδωμ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης τότε ἀπέστη Λομνα ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀπὸ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐγκατέλιπεν κύριον θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ
11 καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἐποίησεν ὑψηλὰ ἐν πόλεσιν Ιουδα καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσεν τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἀπεπλάνησεν τὸν Ιουδαν

12 καὶ ἦλθεν αὐτῷ ἐγγραφὴ παρὰ Ηλιου τοῦ προφήτου λέγων τάδε λέγει κύριος ὁ θεὸς Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρός σου ἀν{Q'} ὧν οὐκ ἐπορεύθης ἐν ὁδῷ Ιωσαφατ τοῦ πατρός σου καὶ ἐν ὁδοῖς Ασα βασιλέως Ιουδα
13 καὶ ἐπορεύθης ἐν ὁδοῖς βασιλέων Ισραηλ καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσας τὸν Ιουδαν καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ὡς ἐξεπόρνευσεν οἶκος Αχααβ καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου υἱοὺς τοῦ πατρός σου τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς ὑπὲρ σὲ ἀπέκτεινας
14 ἰδοὺ κύριος πατάξει σε πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου καὶ ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς σου καὶ ἐν γυναιξίν σου καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ ἀποσκευῇ σου
15 καὶ σὺ ἐν μαλακίᾳ πονηρᾷ ἐν νόσῳ κοιλίας ἕως οὗ ἐξέλθῃ ἡ κοιλία σου μετὰ τῆς μαλακίας ἐξ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας

16 καὶ ἐπήγειρεν κύριος ἐπὶ Ιωραμ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους καὶ τοὺς Ἄραβας καὶ τοὺς ὁμόρους τῶν Αἰθιόπων
17 καὶ ἀνέβησαν ἐπὶ Ιουδαν καὶ κατεδυνάστευον καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν πᾶσαν τὴν ἀποσκευήν ἣν εὗρον ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη αὐτῷ υἱὸς ἀλ{L'} ἢ Οχοζιας ὁ μικρότατος τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ
18 καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα πάντα ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν κύριος εἰς τὴν κοιλίαν μαλακίᾳ ἐν ᾗ οὐκ ἔστιν ἰατρεία
19 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐξ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας καὶ ὡς ἦλθεν καιρὸς τῶν ἡμερῶν ἡμέρας δύο ἐξῆλθεν ἡ κοιλία αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῆς νόσου καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐν μαλακίᾳ πονηρᾷ καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησεν ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ ἐκφορὰν καθὼς ἐκφορὰν πατέρων αὐτοῦ
20 ἦν τριάκοντα καὶ δύο ἐτῶν ὅτε ἐβασίλευσεν καὶ ὀκτὼ ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν οὐκ ἐπαίνῳ καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ καὶ οὐκ ἐν τάφοις τῶν βασιλέων
