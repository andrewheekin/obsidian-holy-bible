# Second Book of Chronicles 27 (RSVCE)

### Reign of Jotham
1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jeruʹshah the daughter of Zadok.
2 And he did what was right in the eyes of theLordaccording to all that his father Uzziʹah had done—only he did not invade the temple of theLord. But the people still followed corrupt practices.
3 He built the upper gate of the house of theLord, and did much building on the wall of Ophel.
4 Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers on the wooded hills.
5 He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave him that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and the third years.
6 So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before theLordhis God.
7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
8 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
9 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 27 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Viginti quinque annorum erat Joatham cum regnare cœpisset, et sedecim annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Jerusa filia Sadoc.
2 Fecitque quod rectum erat coram Domino, juxta omnia quæ fecerat Ozias pater suus, excepto quod non est ingressus templum Domini: et adhuc populus delinquebat.
3 Ipse ædificavit portam domus Domini excelsam, et in muro Ophel multa construxit.
4 Urbes quoque ædificavit in montibus Juda, et in saltibus castella et turres.
5 Ipse pugnavit contra regem filiorum Ammon, et vicit eos, dederuntque ei filii Ammon in tempore illo centum talenta argenti, et decem millia coros tritici, ac totidem coros hordei: hæc ei præbuerunt filii Ammon in anno secundo et tertio.
6 Corroboratusque est Joatham, eo quod direxisset vias suas coram Domino Deo suo.
7 Reliqua autem sermonum Joatham, et omnes pugnæ ejus et opera, scripta sunt in libro regum Israël et Juda.
8 Viginti quinque annorum erat cum regnare cœpisset, et sedecim annis regnavit in Jerusalem.
9 Dormivitque Joatham cum patribus suis, et sepelierunt eum in civitate David: et regnavit Achaz filius ejus pro eo.
