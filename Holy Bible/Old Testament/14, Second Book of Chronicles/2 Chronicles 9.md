# Second Book of Chronicles 9 (RSVCE)

### Visit of the Queen of Sheba
1 Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions, having a very great retinue and camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.
2 And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from Solomon which he could not explain to her.
3 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,
4 the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, and their clothing, his cupbearers, and their clothing, and his burnt offerings which he offered at the house of theLord, there was no more spirit in her.
5 And she said to the king, “The report was true which I heard in my own land of your affairs and of your wisdom,
6 but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it; and behold, half the greatness of your wisdom was not told me; you surpass the report which I heard.
7 Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
8 Blessed be theLordyour God, who has delighted in you and set you on his throne as king for theLordyour God! Because your God loved Israel and would establish them for ever, he has made you king over them, that you may execute justice and righteousness.”
9 Then she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones: there were no spices such as those which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
10 Moreover the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones.
11 And the king made of the algum wood steps for the house of theLordand for the king’s house, lyres also and harps for the singers; there never was seen the like of them before in the land of Judah.
12 And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went back to her own land, with her servants.
### Solomon’s Great Wealth
13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
14 besides that which the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.
15 King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went into each shield.
16 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
17 The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with pure gold.
18 The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached to the throne, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests,
19 while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom.
20 All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.
21 For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
22 Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.
24 Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and of gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
26 And he ruled over all the kings from the Euphraʹtes to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
27 And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shepheʹlah.
28 And horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.
### Death of Solomon
29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahiʹjah the Shiʹlonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat?
30 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
31 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father; and Rehoboʹam his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 9 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Regina quoque Saba, cum audisset famam Salomonis, venit ut tentaret eum in ænigmatibus in Jerusalem, cum magnis opibus et camelis, qui portabant aromata, et auri plurimum, gemmasque pretiosas. Cumque venisset ad Salomonem, locuta est ei quæcumque erant in corde suo.
2 Et exposuit ei Salomon omnia quæ proposuerat: nec quidquam fuit, quod non perspicuum ei fecerit.
3 Quæ postquam vidit, sapientiam scilicet Salomonis, et domum quam ædificaverat,
4 necnon et cibaria mensæ ejus, et habitacula servorum, et officia ministrorum ejus, et vestimenta eorum, pincernas quoque et vestes eorum, et victimas quas immolabat in domo Domini: non erat præ stupore ultra in ea spiritus.
5 Dixitque ad regem: Verus est sermo quem audieram in terra mea de virtutibus et sapientia tua.
6 Non credebam narrantibus donec ipsa venissem, et vidissent oculi mei, et probassem vix medietatem sapientiæ tuæ mihi fuisse narratam: vicisti famam virtutibus tuis.
7 Beati viri tui, et beati servi tui, qui assistunt coram te omni tempore, et audiunt sapientiam tuam.
8 Sit Dominus Deus tuus benedictus, qui voluit te ordinare super thronum suum, regem Domini Dei tui. Quia diligit Deus Israël, et vult servare eum in æternum, idcirco posuit te super eum regem ut facias judicia atque justitiam.

9 Dedit autem regi centum viginti talenta auri, et aromata multa nimis, et gemmas pretiosissimas: non fuerunt aromata talia, ut hæc quæ dedit regina Saba regi Salomoni.
10 Sed et servi Hiram cum servis Salomonis attulerunt aurum de Ophir, et ligna thyina, et gemmas pretiosissimas:
11 de quibus fecit rex, de lignis scilicet thyinis, gradus in domo Domini, et in domo regia, citharas quoque, et psalteria cantoribus: numquam visa sunt in terra Juda ligna talia.
12 Rex autem Salomon dedit reginæ Saba cuncta quæ voluit, et quæ postulavit, et multo plura quam attulerat ad eum: quæ reversa abiit in terram suam cum servis suis.

13 Erat autem pondus auri quod afferebatur Salomoni per singulos annos, sexcenta sexaginta sex talenta auri,
14 excepta ea summa quam legati diversarum gentium et negotiatores afferre consueverant, omnesque reges Arabiæ, et satrapæ terrarum, qui comportabant aurum et argentum Salomoni.
15 Fecit igitur rex Salomon ducentas hastas aureas de summa sexcentorum aureorum, qui in singulis hastis expendebantur:
16 trecenta quoque scuta aurea trecentorum aureorum, quibus tegebantur singula scuta: posuitque ea rex in armentario, quod erat consitum nemore.
17 Fecit quoque rex solium eburneum grande, et vestivit illud auro mundissimo.
18 Sex quoque gradus, quibus ascendebatur ad solium, et scabellum aureum, et brachiola duo altrinsecus, et duos leones stantes juxta brachiola,
19 sed et alios duodecim leunculos stantes super sex gradus ex utraque parte: non fuit tale solium in universis regnis.
20 Omnia quoque vasa convivii regis erant aurea, et vasa domus saltus Libani ex auro purissimo. Argentum enim in diebus illis pro nihilo reputabatur.
21 Siquidem naves regis ibant in Tharsis cum servis Hiram, semel in annis tribus: et deferebant inde aurum, et argentum, et ebur, et simias, et pavos.

22 Magnificatus est igitur Salomon super omnes reges terræ præ divitiis et gloria.
23 Omnesque reges terrarum desiderabant videre faciem Salomonis, ut audirent sapientiam quam dederat Deus in corde ejus:
24 et deferebant ei munera, vasa argentea et aurea, et vestes, et arma, et aromata, equos, et mulos, per singulos annos.
25 Habuit quoque Salomon quadraginta millia equorum in stabulis, et curruum equitumque duodecim millia: constituitque eos in urbibus quadrigarum, et ubi erat rex in Jerusalem.
26 Exercuit etiam potestatem super cunctos reges a flumine Euphrate usque ad terram Philisthinorum, et usque ad terminos Ægypti.
27 Tantamque copiam præbuit argenti in Jerusalem quasi lapidum: et cedrorum tantam multitudinem velut sycomororum quæ gignuntur in campestribus.
28 Adducebantur autem ei equi de Ægypto, cunctisque regionibus.

29 Reliqua autem operum Salomonis priorum et novissimorum scripta sunt in verbis Nathan prophetæ, et in libris Ahiæ Silonitis, in visione quoque Addo videntis contra Jeroboam filium Nabat.
30 Regnavit autem Salomon in Jerusalem super omnem Israël quadraginta annis.
31 Dormivitque cum patribus suis, et sepelierunt eum in civitate David: regnavitque Roboam filius ejus pro eo.

1 καὶ βασίλισσα Σαβα ἤκουσεν τὸ ὄνομα Σαλωμων καὶ ἦλθεν τοῦ πειράσαι Σαλωμων ἐν αἰνίγμασιν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ ἐν δυνάμει βαρείᾳ σφόδρα καὶ κάμηλοι αἴρουσαι ἀρώματα καὶ χρυσίον εἰς πλῆθος καὶ λίθον τίμιον καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς Σαλωμων καὶ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντα ὅσα ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῆς
2 καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν αὐτῇ Σαλωμων πάντας τοὺς λόγους αὐτῆς καὶ οὐ παρῆλθεν λόγος ἀπὸ Σαλωμων ὃν οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῇ
3 καὶ εἶδεν βασίλισσα Σαβα τὴν σοφίαν Σαλωμων καὶ τὸν οἶκον ὃν ᾠκοδόμησεν
4 καὶ τὰ βρώματα τῶν τραπεζῶν καὶ καθέδραν παίδων αὐτοῦ καὶ στάσιν λειτουργῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἱματισμὸν αὐτῶν καὶ οἰνοχόους αὐτοῦ καὶ στολισμὸν αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ἃ ἀνέφερεν ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου καὶ ἐξ ἑαυτῆς ἐγένετο
5 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἀληθινὸς ὁ λόγος ὃν ἤκουσα ἐν τῇ γῇ μου περὶ τῶν λόγων σου καὶ περὶ τῆς σοφίας σου
6 καὶ οὐκ ἐπίστευσα τοῖς λόγοις ἕως οὗ ἦλθον καὶ εἶδον οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἀπηγγέλη μοι ἥμισυ τοῦ πλήθους τῆς σοφίας σου προσέθηκας ἐπὶ τὴν ἀκοήν ἣν ἤκουσα
7 μακάριοι οἱ ἄνδρες μακάριοι οἱ παῖδές σου οὗτοι οἱ παρεστηκότες σοι διὰ παντὸς καὶ ἀκούουσιν σοφίαν σου
8 ἔστω κύριος ὁ θεός σου ηὐλογημένος ὃς ἠθέλησέν σοι τοῦ δοῦναί σε ἐπὶ θρόνον αὐτοῦ εἰς βασιλέα τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ σου ἐν τῷ ἀγαπῆσαι κύριον τὸν θεόν σου τὸν Ισραηλ τοῦ στῆσαι αὐτὸν εἰς αἰῶνα καὶ ἔδωκέν σε ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς εἰς βασιλέα τοῦ ποιῆσαι κρίμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην

9 καὶ ἔδωκεν τῷ βασιλεῖ ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι τάλαντα χρυσίου καὶ ἀρώματα εἰς πλῆθος πολὺ καὶ λίθον τίμιον καὶ οὐκ ἦν κατὰ τὰ ἀρώματα ἐκεῖνα ἃ ἔδωκεν βασίλισσα Σαβα τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμων
10 καὶ οἱ παῖδες Σαλωμων καὶ οἱ παῖδες Χιραμ ἔφερον χρυσίον τῷ Σαλωμων ἐκ Σουφιρ καὶ ξύλα πεύκινα καὶ λίθον τίμιον
11 καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὰ ξύλα τὰ πεύκινα ἀναβάσεις τῷ οἴκῳ κυρίου καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ κιθάρας καὶ νάβλας τοῖς ᾠδοῖς καὶ οὐκ ὤφθησαν τοιαῦτα ἔμπροσθεν ἐν γῇ Ιουδα
12 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμων ἔδωκεν τῇ βασιλίσσῃ Σαβα πάντα τὰ θελήματα αὐτῆς ἃ ᾔτησεν ἐκτὸς πάντων ὧν ἤνεγκεν τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμων καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτῆς

13 καὶ ἦν ὁ σταθμὸς τοῦ χρυσίου τοῦ ἐνεχθέντος τῷ Σαλωμων ἐν ἐνιαυτῷ ἑνὶ ἑξακόσια ἑξήκοντα ἓξ τάλαντα χρυσίου
14 πλὴν τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν ὑποτεταγμένων καὶ τῶν ἐμπορευομένων ὧν ἔφερον καὶ πάντων τῶν βασιλέων τῆς Ἀραβίας καὶ σατραπῶν τῆς γῆς ἔφερον χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμων
15 καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμων διακοσίους θυρεοὺς χρυσοῦς ἐλατούς ἑξακόσιοι χρυσοῖ καθαροὶ τῷ ἑνὶ θυρεῷ ἑξακόσιοι χρυσοῖ ἐπῆσαν ἐπὶ τὸν ἕνα θυρεόν
16 καὶ τριακοσίας ἀσπίδας ἐλατὰς χρυσᾶς τριακοσίων χρυσῶν ἀνεφέρετο ἐπὶ τὴν ἀσπίδα ἑκάστην καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰς ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν οἴκῳ δρυμοῦ τοῦ Λιβάνου
17 καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς θρόνον ἐλεφάντινον ὀδόντων μέγαν καὶ κατεχρύσωσεν αὐτὸν χρυσίῳ δοκίμῳ
18 καὶ ἓξ ἀναβαθμοὶ τῷ θρόνῳ ἐνδεδεμένοι χρυσίῳ καὶ ἀγκῶνες ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου τῆς καθέδρας καὶ δύο λέοντες ἑστηκότες παρὰ τοὺς ἀγκῶνας
19 καὶ δώδεκα λέοντες ἑστηκότες ἐκεῖ ἐπὶ τῶν ἓξ ἀναβαθμῶν ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν οὐκ ἐγενήθη οὕτως ἐν πάσῃ βασιλείᾳ
20 καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τοῦ βασιλέως Σαλωμων χρυσίου καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη οἴκου δρυμοῦ τοῦ Λιβάνου χρυσίῳ κατειλημμένα οὐκ ἦν ἀργύριον λογιζόμενον ἐν ἡμέραις Σαλωμων εἰς οὐθέν
21 ὅτι ναῦς τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐπορεύετο εἰς Θαρσις μετὰ τῶν παίδων Χιραμ ἅπαξ διὰ τριῶν ἐτῶν ἤρχετο πλοῖα ἐκ Θαρσις τῷ βασιλεῖ γέμοντα χρυσίου καὶ ἀργυρίου καὶ ὀδόντων ἐλεφαντίνων καὶ πιθήκων

22 καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθη Σαλωμων ὑπὲρ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς καὶ πλούτῳ καὶ σοφίᾳ
23 καὶ πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς ἐζήτουν τὸ πρόσωπον Σαλωμων ἀκοῦσαι τῆς σοφίας αὐτοῦ ἧς ἔδωκεν ὁ θεὸς ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ
24 καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔφερον ἕκαστος τὰ δῶρα αὐτοῦ σκεύη ἀργυρᾶ καὶ σκεύη χρυσᾶ καὶ ἱματισμόν στακτὴν καὶ ἡδύσματα ἵππους καὶ ἡμιόνους τὸ κα{T'} ἐνιαυτὸν ἐνιαυτόν
25 καὶ ἦσαν τῷ Σαλωμων τέσσαρες χιλιάδες θήλειαι ἵπποι εἰς ἅρματα καὶ δώδεκα χιλιάδες ἱππέων καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοὺς ἐν πόλεσιν τῶν ἁρμάτων καὶ μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
26 καὶ ἦν ἡγούμενος πάντων τῶν βασιλέων ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ ἕως γῆς ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἕως ὁρίου Αἰγύπτου
27 καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ὡς λίθους καὶ τὰς κέδρους ὡς συκαμίνους τὰς ἐν τῇ πεδινῇ εἰς πλῆθος
28 καὶ ἡ ἔξοδος τῶν ἵππων ἐξ Αἰγύπτου τῷ Σαλωμων καὶ ἐκ πάσης τῆς γῆς

29 καὶ οἱ κατάλοιποι λόγοι Σαλωμων οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι ἰδοὺ γεγραμμένοι ἐπὶ τῶν λόγων Ναθαν τοῦ προφήτου καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν λόγων Αχια τοῦ Σηλωνίτου καὶ ἐν ταῖς ὁράσεσιν Ιωηλ τοῦ ὁρῶντος περὶ Ιεροβοαμ υἱοῦ Ναβατ
30 καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Σαλωμων ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ πάντα Ισραηλ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη
31 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Σαλωμων καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ροβοαμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
