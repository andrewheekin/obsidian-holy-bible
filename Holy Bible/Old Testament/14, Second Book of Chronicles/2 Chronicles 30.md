# Second Book of Chronicles 30 (RSVCE)

### The Great Passover
1 Hezekiʹah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Eʹphraim and Manasʹseh, that they should come to the house of theLordat Jerusalem, to keep the passover to theLordthe God of Israel.
2 For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the passover in the second month—
3 for they could not keep it in its time because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem—
4 and the plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly.
5 So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the passover to theLordthe God of Israel, at Jerusalem; for they had not kept it in great numbers as prescribed.
6 So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying, “O people of Israel, return to theLord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
7 Do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who were faithless to theLordGod of their fathers, so that he made them a desolation, as you see.
8 Do not now be stiff-necked as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to theLord, and come to his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever, and serve theLordyour God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
9 For if you return to theLord, your brethren and your children will find compassion with their captors, and return to this land. For theLordyour God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him.”
10 So the couriers went from city to city through the country of Eʹphraim and Manasʹseh, and as far as Zebʹulun; but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
11 Only a few men of Asher, of Manasʹseh, and of Zebʹulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
12 The hand of God was also upon Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of theLord.
13 And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
14 They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for burning incense they took away and threw into the Kidron valley.
15 And they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were put to shame, so that they sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of theLord.
16 They took their accustomed posts according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites.
17 For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had to kill the passover lamb for every one who was not clean, to make it holy to theLord.
18 For a multitude of the people, many of them from Eʹphraim, Manasʹseh, Isʹsachar, and Zebʹulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise than as prescribed. For Hezekiʹah had prayed for them, saying, “The goodLordpardon every one
19 who sets his heart to seek God, theLordthe God of his fathers, even though not according to the sanctuary’s rules of cleanness.”
20 And theLordheard Hezekiʹah, and healed the people.
21 And the people of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised theLordday by day, singing with all their might to theLord.
22 And Hezekiʹah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of theLord. So the people ate the food of the festival for seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to theLordthe God of their fathers.
23 Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the feast for another seven days; so they kept it for another seven days with gladness.
24 For Hezekiʹah king of Judah gave the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for offerings, and the princes gave the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. And the priests sanctified themselves in great numbers.
25 The whole assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites, and the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and the sojourners who dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.
27 Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy habitation in heaven.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 30 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Misit quoque Ezechias ad omnem Israël et Judam: scripsitque epistolas ad Ephraim et Manassen ut venirent ad domum Domini in Jerusalem, et facerent Phase Domino Deo Israël.
2 Inito ergo consilio regis et principum, et universi cœtus Jerusalem, decreverunt ut facerent Phase mense secundo.
3 Non enim potuerant facere in tempore suo, quia sacerdotes qui possent sufficere, sanctificati non fuerant, et populus nondum congregatus fuerat in Jerusalem.
4 Placuitque sermo regi, et omni multitudini.
5 Et decreverunt ut mitterent nuntios in universum Israël, de Bersabee usque Dan, ut venirent, et facerent Phase Domino Deo Israël in Jerusalem: multi enim non fecerant sicut lege præscriptum est.
6 Perrexeruntque cursores cum epistolis ex regis imperio, et principum ejus, in universum Israël et Judam, juxta id quod rex jusserat, prædicantes: Filii Israël, revertimini ad Dominum Deum Abraham, et Isaac, et Israël: et revertetur ad reliquias quæ effugerunt manum regis Assyriorum.
7 Nolite fieri sicut patres vestri et fratres, qui recesserunt a Domino Deo patrum suorum, qui tradidit eos in interitum, ut ipsi cernitis.
8 Nolite indurare cervices vestras, sicut patres vestri: tradite manus Domino, et venite ad sanctuarium ejus quod sanctificavit in æternum: servite Domino Deo patrum vestrorum, et avertetur a vobis ira furoris ejus.
9 Si enim vos reversi fueritis ad Dominum, fratres vestri et filii habebunt misericordiam coram dominis suis, qui illos duxerunt captivos, et revertentur in terram hanc: pius enim et clemens est Dominus Deus vester, et non avertet faciem suam a vobis, si reversi fueritis ad eum.

10 Igitur cursores pergebant velociter de civitate in civitatem per terram Ephraim et Manasse usque ad Zabulon, illis irridentibus et subsannantibus eos.
11 Attamen quidam viri ex Aser, et Manasse, et Zabulon acquiescentes consilio, venerunt Jerusalem.
12 In Juda vero facta est manus Domini ut daret eis cor unum, ut facerent juxta præceptum regis et principum verbum Domini.
13 Congregatique sunt in Jerusalem populi multi ut facerent solemnitatem azymorum, in mense secundo:
14 et surgentes destruxerunt altaria quæ erant in Jerusalem, atque universa in quibus idolis adolebatur incensum, subvertentes, projecerunt in torrentem Cedron.
15 Immolaverunt autem Phase quartadecima die mensis secundi. Sacerdotes quoque atque Levitæ tandem sanctificati, obtulerunt holocausta in domo Domini:
16 steteruntque in ordine suo juxta dispositionem et legem Moysi hominis Dei: sacerdotes vero suscipiebant effundendum sanguinem de manibus Levitarum,
17 eo quod multa turba sanctificata non esset: et idcirco immolarent Levitæ Phase his qui non occurrerant sanctificari Domino.
18 Magna etiam pars populi de Ephraim, et Manasse, et Issachar, et Zabulon, quæ sanctificata non fuerat, comedit Phase non juxta quod scriptum est: et oravit pro eis Ezechias, dicens: Dominus bonus propitiabitur
19 cunctis, qui in toto corde requirunt Dominum Deum patrum suorum: et non imputabit eis quod minus sanctificati sunt.
20 Quem exaudivit Dominus, et placatus est populo.

21 Feceruntque filii Israël, qui inventi sunt in Jerusalem, solemnitatem azymorum septem diebus in lætitia magna, laudantes Dominum per singulos dies: Levitæ quoque et sacerdotes per organa quæ suo officio congruebant.
22 Et locutus est Ezechias ad cor omnium Levitarum qui habebant intelligentiam bonam super Domino: et comederunt septem diebus solemnitatis, immolantes victimas pacificorum, et laudantes Dominum Deum patrum suorum.
23 Placuitque universæ multitudini ut celebrarent etiam alios dies septem: quod et fecerunt cum ingenti gaudio.
24 Ezechias enim rex Juda præbuerat multitudini mille tauros, et septem millia ovium: principes vero dederant populo tauros mille, et oves decem millia: sanctificata est ergo sacerdotum plurima multitudo.
25 Et hilaritate perfusa omnis turba Juda, tam sacerdotum et Levitarum, quam universæ frequentiæ quæ venerat ex Israël: proselytorum quoque de terra Israël, et habitantium in Juda.
26 Factaque est grandis celebritas in Jerusalem, qualis a diebus Salomonis filii David regis Israël in ea urbe non fuerat.
27 Surrexerunt autem sacerdotes atque Levitæ benedicentes populo: et exaudita est vox eorum, pervenitque oratio in habitaculum sanctum cæli.

1 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Εζεκιας ἐπὶ πάντα Ισραηλ καὶ Ιουδαν καὶ ἐπιστολὰς ἔγραψεν ἐπὶ τὸν Εφραιμ καὶ Μανασση ἐλθεῖν εἰς οἶκον κυρίου εἰς Ιερουσαλημ ποιῆσαι τὸ φασεκ τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ Ισραηλ
2 καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία ἡ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ποιῆσαι τὸ φασεκ τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ
3 οὐ γὰρ ἠδυνάσθησαν αὐτὸ ποιῆσαι ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ὅτι οἱ ἱερεῖς οὐχ ἡγνίσθησαν ἱκανοί καὶ ὁ λαὸς οὐ συνήχθη εἰς Ιερουσαλημ
4 καὶ ἤρεσεν ὁ λόγος ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐναντίον τῆς ἐκκλησίας
5 καὶ ἔστησαν λόγον διελθεῖν κήρυγμα ἐν παντὶ Ισραηλ ἀπὸ Βηρσαβεε ἕως Δαν ἐλθόντας ποιῆσαι τὸ φασεκ κυρίῳ θεῷ Ισραηλ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ὅτι πλῆθος οὐκ ἐποίησεν κατὰ τὴν γραφήν
6 καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ τρέχοντες σὺν ταῖς ἐπιστολαῖς παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων εἰς πάντα Ισραηλ καὶ Ιουδαν κατὰ τὸ πρόσταγμα τοῦ βασιλέως λέγοντες υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἐπιστρέψατε πρὸς θεὸν Αβρααμ καὶ Ισαακ καὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπιστρέψει τοὺς ἀνασεσῳσμένους τοὺς καταλειφθέντας ἀπὸ χειρὸς βασιλέως Ασσουρ
7 καὶ μὴ γίνεσθε καθὼς οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ὑμῶν οἳ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ κυρίου θεοῦ πατέρων αὐτῶν καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς ἐρήμωσιν καθὼς ὑμεῖς ὁρᾶτε
8 καὶ νῦν μὴ σκληρύνητε τοὺς τραχήλους ὑμῶν δότε δόξαν κυρίῳ τῷ θεῷ καὶ εἰσέλθατε εἰς τὸ ἁγίασμα αὐτοῦ ὃ ἡγίασεν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα καὶ δουλεύσατε τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ ὑμῶν καὶ ἀποστρέψει ἀ{F'} ὑμῶν θυμὸν ὀργῆς
9 ὅτι ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέφειν ὑμᾶς πρὸς κύριον οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν ἔσονται ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς ἔναντι πάντων τῶν αἰχμαλωτισάντων αὐτούς καὶ ἀποστρέψει εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην ὅτι ἐλεήμων καὶ οἰκτίρμων κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν καὶ οὐκ ἀποστρέψει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀ{F'} ἡμῶν ἐὰν ἐπιστρέψωμεν πρὸς αὐτόν

10 καὶ ἦσαν οἱ τρέχοντες διαπορευόμενοι πόλιν ἐκ πόλεως ἐν τῷ ὄρει Εφραιμ καὶ Μανασση καὶ ἕως Ζαβουλων καὶ ἐγένοντο ὡς καταγελῶντες αὐτῶν καὶ καταμωκώμενοι
11 ἀλλὰ ἄνθρωποι Ασηρ καὶ ἀπὸ Μανασση καὶ ἀπὸ Ζαβουλων ἐνετράπησαν καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Ιερουσαλημ
12 καὶ ἐν Ιουδα ἐγένετο χεὶρ κυρίου δοῦναι αὐτοῖς καρδίαν μίαν ἐλθεῖν τοῦ ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸ πρόσταγμα τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου
13 καὶ συνήχθησαν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ λαὸς πολὺς τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἐκκλησία πολλὴ σφόδρα
14 καὶ ἀνέστησαν καὶ καθεῖλαν τὰ θυσιαστήρια τὰ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ πάντα ἐν οἷς ἐθυμιῶσαν τοῖς ψευδέσιν κατέσπασαν καὶ ἔρριψαν εἰς τὸν χειμάρρουν Κεδρων
15 καὶ ἔθυσαν τὸ φασεκ τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ δευτέρου καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐνετράπησαν καὶ ἡγνίσθησαν καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν ὁλοκαυτώματα εἰς οἶκον κυρίου
16 καὶ ἔστησαν ἐπὶ τὴν στάσιν αὐτῶν κατὰ τὸ κρίμα αὐτῶν κατὰ τὴν ἐντολὴν Μωυσῆ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐδέχοντο τὰ αἵματα ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν Λευιτῶν
17 ὅτι πλῆθος τῆς ἐκκλησίας οὐχ ἡγνίσθη καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἦσαν τοῦ θύειν τὸ φασεκ παντὶ τῷ μὴ δυναμένῳ ἁγνισθῆναι τῷ κυρίῳ
18 ὅτι τὸ πλεῖστον τοῦ λαοῦ ἀπὸ Εφραιμ καὶ Μανασση καὶ Ισσαχαρ καὶ Ζαβουλων οὐχ ἡγνίσθησαν ἀλλὰ ἔφαγον τὸ φασεκ παρὰ τὴν γραφήν καὶ προσηύξατο Εζεκιας περὶ αὐτῶν λέγων κύριος ὁ ἀγαθὸς ἐξιλασάσθω ὑπὲρ
19 πάσης καρδίας κατευθυνούσης ἐκζητῆσαι κύριον τὸν θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὴν ἁγνείαν τῶν ἁγίων
20 καὶ ἐπήκουσεν κύριος τῷ Εζεκια καὶ ἰάσατο τὸν λαόν

21 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ μεγάλῃ καὶ καθυμνοῦντες τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμέραν κα{Q'} ἡμέραν καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐν ὀργάνοις τῷ κυρίῳ
22 καὶ ἐλάλησεν Εζεκιας ἐπὶ πᾶσαν καρδίαν τῶν Λευιτῶν καὶ τῶν συνιόντων σύνεσιν ἀγαθὴν τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ συνετέλεσαν τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας θύοντες θυσίας σωτηρίου καὶ ἐξομολογούμενοι τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν
23 καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο ἡ ἐκκλησία ἅμα ποιῆσαι ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἄλλας καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ
24 ὅτι Εζεκιας ἀπήρξατο τῷ Ιουδα τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ μόσχους χιλίους καὶ ἑπτακισχίλια πρόβατα καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ἀπήρξαντο τῷ λαῷ μόσχους χιλίους καὶ πρόβατα δέκα χιλιάδας καὶ τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἱερέων εἰς πλῆθος
25 καὶ ηὐφράνθη πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία Ιουδα καὶ οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἐξ Ισραηλ καὶ οἱ προσήλυτοι οἱ ἐλθόντες ἀπὸ γῆς Ισραηλ καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ιουδα
26 καὶ ἐγένετο εὐφροσύνη μεγάλη ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἀπὸ ἡμερῶν Σαλωμων υἱοῦ Δαυιδ βασιλέως Ισραηλ οὐκ ἐγένετο τοιαύτη ἑορτὴ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
27 καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ Λευῖται καὶ ηὐλόγησαν τὸν λαόν καὶ ἐπηκούσθη ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῶν καὶ ἦλθεν ἡ προσευχὴ αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ κατοικητήριον τὸ ἅγιον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν
