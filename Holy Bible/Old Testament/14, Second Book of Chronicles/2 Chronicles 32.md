# Second Book of Chronicles 32 (RSVCE)

### Sennacherib’s Invasion
1 After these things and these acts of faithfulness Sennachʹerib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah and encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to win them for himself.
2 And when Hezekiʹah saw that Sennachʹerib had come and intended to fight against Jerusalem,
3 he planned with his officers and his mighty men to stop the water of the springs that were outside the city; and they helped him.
4 A great many people were gathered, and they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?”
5 He set to work resolutely and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised towers upon it, and outside it he built another wall; and he strengthened the Millo in the city of David. He also made weapons and shields in abundance.
6 And he set combat commanders over the people, and gathered them together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,
7 “Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him; for there is one greater with us than with him.
8 With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is theLordour God, to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people took confidence from the words of Hezekiʹah king of Judah.
9 After this Sennachʹerib king of Assyria, who was besieging Lachish with all his forces, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiʹah king of Judah and to all the people of Judah that were in Jerusalem, saying,
10 “Thus says Sennachʹerib king of Assyria, ‘On what are you relying, that you stand siege in Jerusalem?
11 Is not Hezekiʹah misleading you, that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, “TheLordour God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria”?
12 Has not this same Hezekiʹah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, “Before one altar you shall worship, and upon it you shall burn your sacrifices”?
13 Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
14 Who among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed was able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand?
15 Now therefore do not let Hezekiʹah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!’ ”
16 And his servants said still more against the LordGodand against his servant Hezekiʹah.
17 And he wrote letters to cast contempt on theLordthe God of Israel and to speak against him, saying, “Like the gods of the nations of the lands who have not delivered their people from my hands, so the God of Hezekiʹah will not deliver his people from my hand.”
18 And they shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were upon the wall, to frighten and terrify them, in order that they might take the city.
19 And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands.
### Sennacherib’s Defeat and Death
20 Then Hezekiʹah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this and cried to heaven.
21 And theLordsent an angel, who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he came into the house of his god, some of his own sons struck him down there with the sword.
22 So theLordsaved Hezekiʹah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennachʹerib king of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies; and he gave them rest on every side.
23 And many brought gifts to theLordto Jerusalem and precious things to Hezekiʹah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from that time onward.
### Hezekiah’s Sickness
24 In those days Hezekiʹah became sick and was at the point of death, and he prayed to theLord; and he answered him and gave him a sign.
25 But Hezekiʹah did not make return according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was proud. Therefore wrath came upon him and Judah and Jerusalem.
26 But Hezekiʹah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of theLorddid not come upon them in the days of Hezekiʹah.
### Hezekiah’s Prosperity and Achievements
27 And Hezekiʹah had very great riches and honor; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of costly vessels;
28 storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds.
29 He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very great possessions.
30 This same Hezekiʹah closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiʹah prospered in all his works.
31 And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the sign that had been done in the land, God left him to himself, in order to try him and to know all that was in his heart.
32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiʹah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
33 And Hezekiʹah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasʹseh his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Secundus Paralipomenon 32 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Post quæ et hujuscemodi veritatem, venit Sennacherib rex Assyriorum, et ingressus Judam, obsedit civitates munitas, volens eas capere.
2 Quod cum vidisset Ezechias, venisse scilicet Sennacherib, et totum belli impetum verti contra Jerusalem,
3 inito cum principibus consilio, virisque fortissimis, ut obturarent capita fontium qui erant extra urbem: et hoc omnium decernente sententia,
4 congregavit plurimam multitudinem, et obturaverunt cunctos fontes, et rivum qui fluebat in medio terræ, dicentes: Ne veniant reges Assyriorum, et inveniant aquarum abundantiam.
5 Ædificavit quoque, agens industrie, omnem murum qui fuerat dissipatus, et exstruxit turres desuper, et forinsecus alterum murum: instauravitque Mello in civitate David, et fecit universi generis armaturam et clypeos:
6 constituitque principes bellatorum in exercitu, et convocavit universos in platea portæ civitatis, ac locutus est ad cor eorum, dicens:
7 Viriliter agite, et confortamini: nolite timere, nec paveatis regem Assyriorum, et universam multitudinem quæ est cum eo: multo enim plures nobiscum sunt, quam cum illo.
8 Cum illo enim est brachium carneum: nobiscum Dominus Deus noster, qui auxiliator est noster, pugnatque pro nobis. Confortatusque est populus hujuscemodi verbis Ezechiæ regis Juda.

9 Quæ postquam gesta sunt, misit Sennacherib rex Assyriorum servos suos in Jerusalem (ipse enim cum universo exercitu obsidebat Lachis) ad Ezechiam regem Juda, et ad omnem populum qui erat in urbe, dicens:
10 Hæc dicit Sennacherib rex Assyriorum: In quo habentes fiduciam sedetis obsessi in Jerusalem?
11 num Ezechias decipit vos, ut tradat morti in fame et siti, affirmans quod Dominus Deus vester liberet vos de manu regis Assyriorum?
12 Numquid non iste est Ezechias, qui destruxit excelsa illius, et altaria, et præcepit Juda et Jerusalem, dicens: Coram altari uno adorabitis, et in ipso comburetis incensum?
13 an ignoratis quæ ego fecerim, et patres mei, cunctis terrarum populis? numquid prævaluerunt dii gentium, omniumque terrarum, liberare regionem suam de manu mea?
14 Quis est de universis diis gentium, quas vastaverunt patres mei, qui potuerit eruere populum suum de manu mea, ut possit etiam Deus vester eruere vos de hac manu?
15 non vos ergo decipiat Ezechias, nec vana persuasione deludat, neque credatis ei. Si enim nullus potuit deus cunctarum gentium atque regnorum liberare populum suum de manu mea, et de manu patrum meorum, consequenter nec Deus vester poterit eruere vos de manu mea.
16 Sed et alia multa locuti sunt servi ejus contra Dominum Deum, et contra Ezechiam servum ejus.
17 Epistolas quoque scripsit plenas blasphemiæ in Dominum Deum Israël, et locutus est adversus eum: Sicut dii gentium ceterarum non potuerunt liberare populum suum de manu mea, sic et Deus Ezechiæ eruere non poterit populum suum de manu ista.
18 Insuper et clamore magno, lingua judaica, contra populum qui sedebat in muris Jerusalem, personabat, ut terreret eos, et caperet civitatem.
19 Locutusque est contra Deum Jerusalem, sicut adversum deos populorum terræ, opera manuum hominum.

20 Oraverunt igitur Ezechias rex, et Isaias filius Amos prophetes, adversum hanc blasphemiam, ac vociferati sunt usque in cælum.
21 Et misit Dominus angelum, qui percussit omnem virum robustum, et bellatorem, et principem exercitus regis Assyriorum: reversusque est cum ignominia in terram suam. Cumque ingressus esset domum dei sui, filii qui egressi fuerant de utero ejus interfecerunt eum gladio.
22 Salvavitque Dominus Ezechiam et habitatores Jerusalem de manu Sennacherib regis Assyriorum, et de manu omnium, et præstitit eis quietem per circuitum.
23 Multi etiam deferebant hostias et sacrificia Domino in Jerusalem, et munera Ezechiæ regi Juda: qui exaltatus est post hæc coram cunctis gentibus.

24 In diebus illis ægrotavit Ezechias usque ad mortem, et oravit Dominum: exaudivitque eum, et dedit ei signum.
25 Sed non juxta beneficia quæ acceperat, retribuit, quia elevatum est cor ejus: et facta est contra eum ira, et contra Judam et Jerusalem.
26 Humiliatusque est postea, eo quod exaltatum fuisset cor ejus, tam ipse quam habitatores Jerusalem: et idcirco non venit super eos ira Domini in diebus Ezechiæ.
27 Fuit autem Ezechias dives, et inclytus valde, et thesauros sibi plurimos congregavit argenti, et auri, et lapidis pretiosi, aromatum, et armorum universi generis, et vasorum magni pretii.
28 Apothecas quoque frumenti, vini, et olei, et præsepia omnium jumentorum, caulasque pecorum,
29 et urbes ædificavit sibi: habebat quippe greges ovium et armentorum innumerabiles, eo quod dedisset ei Dominus substantiam multam nimis.
30 Ipse est Ezechias, qui obturavit superiorem fontem aquarum Gihon, et avertit eas subter ad occidentem urbis David: in omnibus operibus suis fecit prospere quæ voluit.
31 Attamen in legatione principum Babylonis, qui missi fuerant ad eum ut interrogarent de portento quod acciderat super terram, dereliquit eum Deus ut tentaretur, et nota fierent omnia quæ erant in corde ejus.
32 Reliqua autem sermonum Ezechiæ, et misericordiarum ejus, scripta sunt in visione Isaiæ filii Amos prophetæ, et in libro regum Juda et Israël.
33 Dormivitque Ezechias cum patribus suis, et sepelierunt eum super sepulchra filiorum David: et celebravit ejus exequias universus Juda, et omnes habitatores Jerusalem: regnavitque Manasses filius ejus pro eo.

1 καὶ μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ταύτην ἦλθεν Σενναχηριμ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ Ιουδαν καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις τὰς τειχήρεις καὶ εἶπεν προκαταλαβέσθαι αὐτάς
2 καὶ εἶδεν Εζεκιας ὅτι ἥκει Σενναχηριμ καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ τοῦ πολεμῆσαι ἐπὶ Ιερουσαλημ
3 καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο μετὰ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν δυνατῶν ἐμφράξαι τὰ ὕδατα τῶν πηγῶν ἃ ἦν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως καὶ συνεπίσχυσαν αὐτῷ
4 καὶ συνήγαγεν λαὸν πολὺν καὶ ἐνέφραξεν τὰ ὕδατα τῶν πηγῶν καὶ τὸν ποταμὸν τὸν διορίζοντα διὰ τῆς πόλεως λέγων μὴ ἔλθῃ βασιλεὺς Ασσουρ καὶ εὕρῃ ὕδωρ πολὺ καὶ κατισχύσῃ
5 καὶ κατίσχυσεν Εζεκιας καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν πᾶν τὸ τεῖχος τὸ κατεσκαμμένον καὶ πύργους καὶ ἔξω προτείχισμα ἄλλο καὶ κατίσχυσεν τὸ ἀνάλημμα πόλεως Δαυιδ καὶ κατεσκεύασεν ὅπλα πολλά
6 καὶ ἔθετο ἄρχοντας τοῦ πολέμου ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν καὶ συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν πλατεῖαν τῆς πύλης τῆς φάραγγος καὶ ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ καρδίαν αὐτῶν λέγων
7 ἰσχύσατε καὶ ἀνδρίζεσθε μὴ πτοηθῆτε ἀπὸ προσώπου βασιλέως Ασσουρ καὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου παντὸς τοῦ ἔθνους τοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ὅτι με{Q'} ἡμῶν πλείονες ἢ με{T'} αὐτοῦ
8 με{T'} αὐτοῦ βραχίονες σάρκινοι με{Q'} ἡμῶν δὲ κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν τοῦ σῴζειν καὶ τοῦ πολεμεῖν τὸν πόλεμον ἡμῶν καὶ κατεθάρσησεν ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ τοῖς λόγοις Εζεκιου βασιλέως Ιουδα

9 καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπέστειλεν Σενναχηριμ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπὶ Λαχις καὶ πᾶσα ἡ στρατιὰ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς Εζεκιαν βασιλέα Ιουδα καὶ πρὸς πάντα Ιουδαν τὸν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ λέγων
10 οὕτως λέγει Σενναχηριμ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ τίνι ὑμεῖς πεποίθατε καὶ κάθησθε ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
11 οὐχὶ Εζεκιας ἀπατᾷ ὑμᾶς τοῦ παραδοῦναι ὑμᾶς εἰς θάνατον καὶ εἰς λιμὸν καὶ εἰς δίψαν λέγων κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν σώσει ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Ασσουρ
12 οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν Εζεκιας ὃς περιεῖλεν τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ ὑψηλὰ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν τῷ Ιουδα καὶ τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ιερουσαλημ λέγων κατέναντι τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τούτου προσκυνήσετε καὶ ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ θυμιάσετε
13 οὐ γνώσεσθε ὅ τι ἐποίησα ἐγὼ καὶ οἱ πατέρες μου πᾶσι τοῖς λαοῖς τῶν χωρῶν μὴ δυνάμενοι ἠδύναντο θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν πάσης τῆς γῆς σῶσαι τὸν λαὸν αὐτῶν ἐκ χειρός μου
14 τίς ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν τούτων οὓς ἐξωλέθρευσαν οἱ πατέρες μου μὴ ἠδύναντο σῶσαι τὸν λαὸν αὐτῶν ἐκ χειρός μου ὅτι δυνήσεται ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν σῶσαι ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρός μου
15 νῦν μὴ ἀπατάτω ὑμᾶς Εζεκιας καὶ μὴ πεποιθέναι ὑμᾶς ποιείτω κατὰ ταῦτα καὶ μὴ πιστεύετε αὐτῷ ὅτι οὐ μὴ δύνηται ὁ θεὸς παντὸς ἔθνους καὶ βασιλείας τοῦ σῶσαι τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐκ χειρός μου καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς πατέρων μου ὅτι ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν οὐ μὴ σώσει ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρός μου
16 καὶ ἔτι ἐλάλησαν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ κύριον θεὸν καὶ ἐπὶ Εζεκιαν παῖδα αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ βιβλίον ἔγραψεν ὀνειδίζειν τὸν κύριον θεὸν Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν περὶ αὐτοῦ λέγων ὡς θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς οὐκ ἐξείλαντο τοὺς λαοὺς αὐτῶν ἐκ χειρός μου οὕτως οὐ μὴ ἐξέληται ὁ θεὸς Εζεκιου λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐκ χειρός μου
18 καὶ ἐβόησεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Ιουδαϊστὶ ἐπὶ λαὸν Ιερουσαλημ τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους τοῦ φοβῆσαι αὐτοὺς καὶ κατασπάσαι ὅπως προκαταλάβωνται τὴν πόλιν
19 καὶ ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ θεὸν Ιερουσαλημ ὡς καὶ ἐπὶ θεοὺς λαῶν τῆς γῆς ἔργα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων

20 καὶ προσηύξατο Εζεκιας ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ Ησαιας υἱὸς Αμως ὁ προφήτης περὶ τούτων καὶ ἐβόησαν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν
21 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν κύριος ἄγγελον καὶ ἐξέτριψεν πᾶν δυνατὸν πολεμιστὴν καὶ ἄρχοντα καὶ στρατηγὸν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ βασιλέως Ασσουρ καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν μετὰ αἰσχύνης προσώπου εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν ἐξελθόντων ἐκ κοιλίας αὐτοῦ κατέβαλον αὐτὸν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ
22 καὶ ἔσωσεν κύριος Εζεκιαν καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἐκ χειρὸς Σενναχηριμ βασιλέως Ασσουρ καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς πάντων καὶ κατέπαυσεν αὐτοὺς κυκλόθεν
23 καὶ πολλοὶ ἔφερον δῶρα τῷ κυρίῳ εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ δόματα τῷ Εζεκια βασιλεῖ Ιουδα καὶ ὑπερήρθη κα{T'} ὀφθαλμοὺς πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν μετὰ ταῦτα

24 ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἠρρώστησεν Εζεκιας ἕως θανάτου καὶ προσηύξατο πρὸς κύριον καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ καὶ σημεῖον ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ
25 καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὸ ἀνταπόδομα ὃ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ἀνταπέδωκεν Εζεκιας ἀλλὰ ὑψώθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγένετο ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν ὀργὴ καὶ ἐπὶ Ιουδαν καὶ Ιερουσαλημ
26 καὶ ἐταπεινώθη Εζεκιας ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕψους τῆς καρδίας αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ιερουσαλημ καὶ οὐκ ἐπῆλθεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ὀργὴ κυρίου ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Εζεκιου
27 καὶ ἐγένετο τῷ Εζεκια πλοῦτος καὶ δόξα πολλὴ σφόδρα καὶ θησαυροὺς ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου καὶ τοῦ λίθου τοῦ τιμίου καὶ εἰς τὰ ἀρώματα καὶ ὁπλοθήκας καὶ εἰς σκεύη ἐπιθυμητὰ
28 καὶ πόλεις εἰς τὰ γενήματα σίτου καὶ ἐλαίου καὶ οἴνου καὶ φάτνας παντὸς κτήνους καὶ μάνδρας εἰς τὰ ποίμνια
29 καὶ πόλεις ἃς ᾠκοδόμησεν αὑτῷ καὶ ἀποσκευὴν προβάτων καὶ βοῶν εἰς πλῆθος ὅτι ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ κύριος ἀποσκευὴν πολλὴν σφόδρα
30 αὐτὸς Εζεκιας ἐνέφραξεν τὴν ἔξοδον τοῦ ὕδατος Γιων τὸ ἄνω καὶ κατηύθυνεν αὐτὰ κάτω πρὸς λίβα τῆς πόλεως Δαυιδ καὶ εὐοδώθη Εζεκιας ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ
31 καὶ οὕτως τοῖς πρεσβευταῖς τῶν ἀρχόντων ἀπὸ Βαβυλῶνος τοῖς ἀποσταλεῖσιν πρὸς αὐτὸν πυθέσθαι πα{R'} αὐτοῦ τὸ τέρας ὃ ἐγένετο ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐγκατέλιπεν αὐτὸν κύριος τοῦ πειράσαι αὐτὸν εἰδέναι τὰ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ
32 καὶ τὰ κατάλοιπα τῶν λόγων Εζεκιου καὶ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ ἰδοὺ γέγραπται ἐν τῇ προφητείᾳ Ησαιου υἱοῦ Αμως τοῦ προφήτου καὶ ἐπὶ βιβλίου βασιλέων Ιουδα καὶ Ισραηλ
33 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Εζεκιας μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν ἀναβάσει τάφων υἱῶν Δαυιδ καὶ δόξαν καὶ τιμὴν ἔδωκαν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ αὐτοῦ πᾶς Ιουδα καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Μανασσης υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
