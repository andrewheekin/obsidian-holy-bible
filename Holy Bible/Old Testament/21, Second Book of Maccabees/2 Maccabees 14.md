# Second Book of Maccabees 14 (RSVCE)

### Alʹcimus Speaks against Judas
1 Three years later, word came to Judas and his men that Demeʹtrius, the son of Seleuʹcus, had sailed into the harbor of Tripʹolis with a strong army and a fleet,
2 and had taken possession of the country, having made away with Antiʹochus and his guardian Lysʹias.
3 Now a certain Alʹcimus, who had formerly been high priest but had wilfully defiled himself in the times of separation, realized that there was no way for him to be safe or to have access again to the holy altar,
4 and went to King Demeʹtrius in about the one hundred and fifty-first year, presenting to him a crown of gold and a palm, and besides these some of the customary olive branches from the temple. During that day he kept quiet.
5 But he found an opportunity that furthered his mad purpose when he was invited by Demeʹtrius to a meeting of the council and was asked about the disposition and intentions of the Jews. He answered:
6 “Those of the Jews who are called Hasideʹans, whose leader is Judas Maccabeʹus, are keeping up war and stirring up sedition, and will not let the kingdom attain tranquillity.
7 Therefore I have laid aside my ancestral glory—I mean the high priesthood—and have now come here,
8 first because I am genuinely concerned for the interests of the king, and second because I have regard also for my fellow citizens. For through the folly of those whom I have mentioned our whole nation is now in no small misfortune.
9 Since you are acquainted, O king, with the details of this matter, deign to take thought for our country and our hard-pressed nation with the gracious kindness which you show to all.
10 For as long as Judas lives, it is impossible for the government to find peace.”
11 When he had said this, the rest of the king’s friends, who were hostile to Judas, quickly inflamed Demeʹtrius still more.
12 And he immediately chose Nicaʹnor, who had been in command of the elephants, appointed him governor of Judea, and sent him off
13 with orders to kill Judas and scatter his men, and to set up Alʹcimus as high priest of the greatest temple.
14 And the Gentiles throughout Judea, who had fled before Judas, flocked to join Nicaʹnor, thinking that the misfortunes and calamities of the Jews would mean prosperity for themselves.
### Nicanor Makes Friends with Judas
15 When the Jews heard of Nicaʹnor’s coming and the gathering of the Gentiles, they sprinkled dust upon their heads and prayed to him who established his own people for ever and always upholds his own heritage by manifesting himself.
16 At the command of the leader, they set out from there immediately and engaged them in battle at a village called Dessau.
17 Simon, the brother of Judas, had encountered Nicaʹnor, but had been temporarily checked because of the sudden consternation created by the enemy.
18 Nevertheless Nicaʹnor, hearing of the valor of Judas and his men and their courage in battle for their country, shrank from deciding the issue by bloodshed.
19 Therefore he sent Posidoʹnius and Theodʹotus and Mattathiʹas to give and receive pledges of friendship.
20 When the terms had been fully considered, and the leader had informed the people, and it had appeared that they were of one mind, they agreed to the covenant.
21 And the leaders set a day on which to meet by themselves. A chariot came forward from each army; seats of honor were set in place;
22 Judas posted armed men in readiness at key places to prevent sudden treachery on the part of the enemy; they held the proper conference.
23 Nicaʹnor stayed on in Jerusalem and did nothing out of the way, but dismissed the flocks of people that had gathered.
24 And he kept Judas always in his presence; he was warmly attached to the man.
25 And he urged him to marry and have children; so he married, settled down, and shared the common life.
### Nicanor Turns against Judas
26 But when Alʹcimus noticed their good will for one another, he took the covenant that had been made and went to Demeʹtrius. He told him that Nicaʹnor was disloyal to the government, for he had appointed that conspirator against the kingdom, Judas, to be his successor.
27 The king became excited and, provoked by the false accusations of that depraved man, wrote to Nicaʹnor, stating that he was displeased with the covenant and commanding him to send Maccabeʹus to Antioch as a prisoner without delay.
28 When this message came to Nicaʹnor, he was troubled and grieved that he had to annul their agreement when the man had done no wrong.
29 Since it was not possible to oppose the king, he watched for an opportunity to accomplish this by a stratagem.
30 But Maccabeʹus, noticing that Nicaʹnor was more austere in his dealings with him and was meeting him more rudely than had been his custom, concluded that this austerity did not spring from the best motives. So he gathered not a few of his men, and went into hiding from Nicaʹnor.
31 When the latter became aware that he had been cleverly outwitted by the man, he went to the great and holy temple while the priests were offering the customary sacrifices, and commanded them to hand the man over.
32 And when they declared on oath that they did not know where the man was whom he sought,
33 he stretched out his right hand toward the sanctuary, and swore this oath: “If you do not hand Judas over to me as a prisoner, I will level this precinct of God to the ground and tear down the altar, and I will build here a splendid temple to Dionyʹsus.”
34 Having said this, he went away. Then the priests stretched forth their hands toward heaven and called upon the constant Defender of our nation, in these words:
35 “O Lord of all, who hast need of nothing, thou wast pleased that there be a temple for thy habitation among us;
36 so now, O holy One, Lord of all holiness, keep undefiled for ever this house that has been so recently purified.”
### Razis Dies for His Country
37 A certain Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, was denounced to Nicaʹnor as a man who loved his fellow citizens and was very well thought of and for his good will was called father of the Jews.
38 For in former times, when there was no mingling with the Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and for Judaism he had with all zeal risked body and life.
39 Nicaʹnor, wishing to exhibit the enmity which he had for the Jews, sent more than five hundred soldiers to arrest him;
40 for he thought that by arresting him he would do them an injury.
41 When the troops were about to capture the tower and were forcing the door of the courtyard, they ordered that fire be brought and the doors burned. Being surrounded, Razis fell upon his own sword,
42 preferring to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of sinners and suffer outrages unworthy of his noble birth.
43 But in the heat of the struggle he did not hit exactly, and the crowd was now rushing in through the doors. He bravely ran up on the wall, and manfully threw himself down into the crowd.
44 But as they quickly drew back, a space opened and he fell in the middle of the empty space.
45 Still alive and aflame with anger, he rose, and though his blood gushed forth and his wounds were severe he ran through the crowd; and standing upon a steep rock,
46 with his blood now completely drained from him, he tore out his entrails, took them with both hands and hurled them at the crowd, calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to give them back to him again. This was the manner of his death.


# Liber Secundus Machabaeorum 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Sed post triennii tempus, cognovit Judas et qui cum eo erant Demetrium Seleuci cum multitudine valida et navibus per portam Tripolis ascendisse ad loca opportuna,
2 et tenuisse regiones adversus Antiochum, et ducem ejus Lysiam.

3 Alcimus autem quidam, qui summus sacerdos fuerat, sed voluntarie coinquinatus est temporibus commistionis, considerans nullo modo sibi esse salutem neque accessum ad altare,
4 venit ad regem Demetrium centesimo quinquagesimo anno, offerens ei coronam auream et palmam, super hæc et thallos, qui templi esse videbantur. Et ipsa quidem die siluit.
5 Tempus autem opportunum dementiæ suæ nactus, convocatus a Demetrio ad consilium, et interrogatus quibus rebus et consiliis Judæi niterentur,
6 respondit: Ipsi qui dicuntur Assidæi Judæorum, quibus præest Judas Machabæus, bella nutriunt, et seditiones movent, nec patiuntur regnum esse quietum:
7 nam et ego defraudatus parentum gloria (dico autem summo sacerdotio) huc veni:
8 primo quidem utilitatibus regis fidem servans, secundo autem etiam civibus consulens: nam illorum pravitate universum genus nostrum non minime vexatur.
9 Sed oro his singulis, o rex, cognitis, et regioni et generi, secundum humanitatem tuam pervulgatam omnibus, prospice:
10 nam, quamdiu superest Judas, impossibile est pacem esse negotiis.

11 Talibus autem ab hoc dictis, et ceteri amici hostiliter se habentes adversus Judam, inflammaverunt Demetrium.
12 Qui statim Nicanorem præpositum elephantorum ducem misit in Judæam:
13 datis mandatis ut ipsum quidem Judam caperet: eos vero qui cum illo erant, dispergeret, et constitueret Alcimum maximi templi summum sacerdotem.
14 Tunc gentes quæ de Judæa fugerant Judam, gregatim se Nicanori miscebant, miserias et clades Judæorum prosperitates rerum suarum existimantes.
15 Audito itaque Judæi Nicanoris adventu, et conventu nationum, conspersi terra rogabant eum qui populum suum constituit, ut in æternum custodiret, quique suam portionem signis evidentibus protegit.
16 Imperante autem duce, statim inde moverunt, conveneruntque ad castellum Dessau.
17 Simon vero frater Judæ commiserat cum Nicanore: sed conterritus est repentino adventu adversariorum.

18 Nicanor tamen, audiens virtutem comitum Judæ, et animi magnitudinem quam pro patriæ certaminibus habebant, sanguine judicium facere metuebat.
19 Quam ob rem præmisit Posidonium, et Theodotium, et Matthiam, ut darent dextras atque acciperent.
20 Et cum diu de his consilium ageretur, et ipse dux ad multitudinem retulisset, omnium una fuit sententia amicitiis annuere.
21 Itaque diem constituerunt, qua secreto inter se agerent: et singulis sellæ prolatæ sunt, et positæ.
22 Præcepit autem Judas armatos esse locis opportunis, ne forte ab hostibus repente mali aliquid oriretur: et congruum colloquium fecerunt.
23 Morabatur autem Nicanor Jerosolymis, nihilque inique agebat: gregesque turbarum quæ congregatæ fuerant, dimisit.
24 Habebat autem Judam semper carum ex animo, et erat viro inclinatus.
25 Rogavitque eum ducere uxorem, filiosque procreare. Nuptias fecit: quiete egit, communiterque vivebant.

26 Alcimus autem, videns caritatem illorum ad invicem et conventiones, venit ad Demetrium, et dicebat Nicanorem rebus alienis assentire, Judamque regni insidiatorem successorem sibi destinasse.
27 Itaque rex exasperatus, et pessimis hujus criminationibus irritatus, scripsit Nicanori, dicens graviter quidem se ferre de amicitiæ conventione, jubere tamen Machabæum citius vinctum mittere Antiochiam.
28 Quibus cognitis, Nicanor consternabatur, et graviter ferebat, si ea quæ convenerant irrita faceret, nihil læsus a viro:
29 sed quia regi resistere non poterat, opportunitatem observabat qua præceptum perficeret.
30 At Machabæus, videns secum austerius agere Nicanorem, et consuetum occursum ferocius exhibentem, intelligens non ex bono esse austeritatem istam, paucis suorum congregatis, occultavit se a Nicanore.

31 Quod cum ille cognovit, fortiter se a viro præventum, venit ad maximum et sanctissimum templum: et sacerdotibus solitas hostias offerentibus, jussit sibi tradi virum.
32 Quibus cum juramento dicentibus nescire se ubi esset qui quærebatur, extendens manum ad templum,
33 juravit, dicens: Nisi Judam mihi vinctum tradideritis, istud Dei fanum in planitiem deducam, et altare effodiam, et templum hoc Libero patri consecrabo.
34 Et his dictis abiit. Sacerdotes autem protendentes manus in cælum, invocabant eum qui semper propugnator esset gentis ipsorum, hæc dicentes:
35 Tu, Domine universorum, qui nullius indiges, voluisti templum habitationis tuæ fieri in nobis.
36 Et nunc, Sancte sanctorum, omnium Domine, conserva in æternum impollutam domum istam, quæ nuper mundata est.

37 Razias autem quidam de senioribus ab Jerosolymis delatus est Nicanori, vir amator civitatis, et bene audiens: qui pro affectu pater Judæorum appellabatur.
38 Hic multis temporibus continentiæ propositum tenuit in Judaismo, corpusque et animam tradere contentus pro perseverantia.
39 Volens autem Nicanor manifestare odium quod habebat in Judæos, misit milites quingentos ut eum comprehenderent.
40 Putabat enim, si illum decepisset, se cladem Judæis maximam illaturum.
41 Turbis autem irruere in domum ejus, et januam dirumpere: atque ignem admovere cupientibus, cum jam comprehenderetur, gladio se petiit,
42 eligens nobiliter mori potius quam subditus fieri peccatoribus, et contra natales suos indignis injuriis agi.
43 Sed cum per festinationem non certo ictu plagam dedisset, et turbæ intra ostia irrumperent, recurrens audacter ad murum præcipitavit semetipsum viriliter in turbas:
44 quibus velociter locum dantibus casui ejus, venit per mediam cervicem.
45 Et cum adhuc spiraret, accensus animo, surrexit, et cum sanguis ejus magno fluxu deflueret, et gravissimis vulneribus esset saucius, cursu turbam pertransiit:
46 et stans supra quamdam petram præruptam, et jam exsanguis effectus, complexus intestina sua, utrisque manibus projecit super turbas, invocans dominatorem vitæ ac spiritus ut hæc illi iterum redderet: atque ita vita defunctus est.

1 μετὰ δὲ τριετῆ χρόνον προσέπεσεν τοῖς περὶ τὸν Ιουδαν Δημήτριον τὸν τοῦ Σελεύκου διὰ τοῦ κατὰ Τρίπολιν λιμένος εἰσπλεύσαντα μετὰ πλήθους ἰσχυροῦ καὶ στόλου

11 τοιούτων δὲ ῥηθέντων ὑπὸ τούτου θᾶττον οἱ λοιποὶ φίλοι δυσμενῶς ἔχοντες τὰ πρὸς τὸν Ιουδαν προσεπύρωσαν τὸν Δημήτριον
12 προχειρισάμενος δὲ εὐθέως Νικάνορα τὸν γενόμενον ἐλεφαντάρχην καὶ στρατηγὸν ἀναδείξας τῆς Ιουδαίας ἐξαπέστειλεν
13 δοὺς ἐντολὰς αὐτὸν μὲν τὸν Ιουδαν ἐπανελέσθαι τοὺς δὲ σὺν αὐτῷ σκορπίσαι καταστῆσαι δὲ Ἄλκιμον ἀρχιερέα τοῦ μεγίστου ἱεροῦ
14 οἱ δὲ ἐπὶ τῆς Ιουδαίας πεφυγαδευκότες τὸν Ιουδαν ἔθνη συνέμισγον ἀγεληδὸν τῷ Νικάνορι τὰς τῶν Ιουδαίων ἀτυχίας καὶ συμφορὰς ἰδίας εὐημερίας δοκοῦντες ἔσεσθαι
15 ἀκούσαντες δὲ τὴν τοῦ Νικάνορος ἔφοδον καὶ τὴν ἐπίθεσιν τῶν ἐθνῶν καταπασάμενοι γῆν ἐλιτάνευον τὸν ἄχρι αἰῶνος συστήσαντα τὸν αὑτοῦ λαόν ἀεὶ δὲ με{T'} ἐπιφανείας ἀντιλαμβανόμενον τῆς ἑαυτοῦ μερίδος

17 Σιμων δὲ ὁ ἀδελφὸς Ιουδου συμβεβληκὼς ἦν τῷ Νικάνορι βραδέως δὲ διὰ τὴν αἰφνίδιον τῶν ἀντιπάλων ἀφασίαν ἐπταικώς

18 ὅμως δὲ ἀκούων ὁ Νικάνωρ ἣν εἶχον οἱ περὶ τὸν Ιουδαν ἀνδραγαθίαν καὶ ἐν τοῖς περὶ τῆς πατρίδος ἀγῶσιν εὐψυχίαν ὑπευλαβεῖτο τὴν κρίσιν δ{I'} αἱμάτων ποιήσασθαι
19 διόπερ ἔπεμψεν Ποσιδώνιον καὶ Θεόδοτον καὶ Ματταθιαν δοῦναι καὶ λαβεῖν δεξιάς
20 πλείονος δὲ γενομένης περὶ τούτων ἐπισκέψεως καὶ τοῦ ἡγουμένου τοῖς πλήθεσιν ἀνακοινωσαμένου καὶ φανείσης ὁμοψήφου γνώμης ἐπένευσαν ταῖς συνθήκαις
21 ἐτάξαντο δὲ ἡμέραν ἐν ᾗ κα{T'} ἰδίαν ἥξουσιν εἰς τὸ αὐτό καὶ προῆλθεν πα{R'} ἑκάστου δίφραξ ἔθεσαν δίφρους
22 διέταξεν Ιουδας ἐνόπλους ἑτοίμους ἐν τοῖς ἐπικαίροις τόποις μήποτε ἐκ τῶν πολεμίων αἰφνιδίως κακουργία γένηται τὴν ἁρμόζουσαν ἐποιήσαντο κοινολογίαν

26 ὁ δὲ Ἄλκιμος συνιδὼν τὴν πρὸς ἀλλήλους εὔνοιαν καὶ τὰς γενομένας συνθήκας λαβὼν ἧκεν πρὸς τὸν Δημήτριον καὶ ἔλεγεν τὸν Νικάνορα ἀλλότρια φρονεῖν τῶν πραγμάτων τὸν γὰρ ἐπίβουλον τῆς βασιλείας Ιουδαν αὐτοῦ διάδοχον ἀναδεῖξαι
27 ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἔκθυμος γενόμενος καὶ ταῖς τοῦ παμπονήρου διαβολαῖς ἐρεθισθεὶς ἔγραψεν Νικάνορι φάσκων ὑπὲρ μὲν τῶν συνθηκῶν βαρέως φέρειν κελεύων δὲ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον δέσμιον ἐξαποστέλλειν εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν ταχέως
28 προσπεσόντων δὲ τούτων τῷ Νικάνορι συνεκέχυτο καὶ δυσφόρως ἔφερεν εἰ τὰ διεσταλμένα ἀθετήσει μηδὲν τἀνδρὸς ἠδικηκότος
