# Second Book of Maccabees 7 (RSVCE)

### The Martyrdom of Seven Brothers
1 It happened also that seven brothers and their mother were arrested and were being compelled by the king, under torture with whips and cords, to partake of unlawful swine’s flesh.
2 One of them, acting as their spokesman, said, “What do you intend to ask and learn from us? For we are ready to die rather than transgress the laws of our fathers.”
3 The king fell into a rage, and gave orders that pans and caldrons be heated.
4 These were heated immediately, and he commanded that the tongue of their spokesman be cut out and that they scalp him and cut off his hands and feet, while the rest of the brothers and the mother looked on.
5 When he was utterly helpless, the king ordered them to take him to the fire, still breathing, and to fry him in a pan. The smoke from the pan spread widely, but the brothers and their mother encouraged one another to die nobly, saying,
6 “The Lord God is watching over us and in truth has compassion on us, as Moses declared in his song which bore witness against the people to their faces, when he said, ‘And he will have compassion on his servants.’ ”
7 After the first brother had died in this way, they brought forward the second for their sport. They tore off the skin of his head with the hair, and asked him, “Will you eat rather than have your body punished limb by limb?”
8 He replied in the language of his fathers, and said to them, “No.” Therefore he in turn underwent tortures as the first brother had done.
9 And when he was at his last breath, he said, “You accursed wretch, you dismiss us from this present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life, because we have died for his laws.”
10 After him, the third was the victim of their sport. When it was demanded, he quickly put out his tongue and courageously stretched forth his hands,
11 and said nobly, “I got these from Heaven, and because of his laws I disdain them, and from him I hope to get them back again.”
12 As a result the king himself and those with him were astonished at the young man’s spirit, for he regarded his sufferings as nothing.
13 When he too had died, they maltreated and tortured the fourth in the same way.
14 And when he was near death, he said, “One cannot but choose to die at the hands of men and to cherish the hope that God gives of being raised again by him. But for you there will be no resurrection to life!”
15 Next they brought forward the fifth and maltreated him.
16 But he looked at the king, and said, “Because you have authority among men, mortal though you are, you do what you please. But do not think that God has forsaken our people.
17 Keep on, and see how his mighty power will torture you and your descendants!”
18 After him they brought forward the sixth. And when he was about to die, he said, “Do not deceive yourself in vain. For we are suffering these things on our own account, because of our sins against our own God. Therefore astounding things have happened.
19 But do not think that you will go unpunished for having tried to fight against God!”
20 The mother was especially admirable and worthy of honorable memory. Though she saw her seven sons perish within a single day, she bore it with good courage because of her hope in the Lord.
21 She encouraged each of them in the language of their fathers. Filled with a noble spirit, she fired her woman’s reasoning with a man’s courage, and said to them,
22 “I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within each of you.
23 Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws.”
24 Antiʹochus felt that he was being treated with contempt, and he was suspicious of her reproachful tone. The youngest brother being still alive, Antiʹochus not only appealed to him in words, but promised with oaths that he would make him rich and enviable if he would turn from the ways of his fathers, and that he would take him for his friend and entrust him with public affairs.
25 Since the young man would not listen to him at all, the king called the mother to him and urged her to advise the youth to save himself.
26 After much urging on his part, she undertook to persuade her son.
27 But, leaning close to him, she spoke in their native tongue as follows, deriding the cruel tyrant: “My son, have pity on me. I carried you nine months in my womb, and nursed you for three years, and have reared you and brought you up to this point in your life, and have taken care of you.
28 I beseech you, my child, to look at the heaven and the earth and see everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make them out of things that existed. Thus also mankind comes into being.
29 Do not fear this butcher, but prove worthy of your brothers. Accept death, so that in God’s mercy I may get you back again with your brothers.”
30 While she was still speaking, the young man said, “What are you waiting for? I will not obey the king’s command, but I obey the command of the law that was given to our fathers through Moses.
31 But you, who have contrived all sorts of evil against the Hebrews, will certainly not escape the hands of God.
32 For we are suffering because of our own sins.
33 And if our living Lord is angry for a little while, to rebuke and discipline us, he will again be reconciled with his own servants.
34 But you, unholy wretch, you most defiled of all men, do not be elated in vain and puffed up by uncertain hopes, when you raise your hand against the children of heaven.
35 You have not yet escaped the judgment of the almighty, all-seeing God.
36 For our brothers after enduring a brief suffering have drunk of everflowing life under God’s covenant; but you, by the judgment of God, will receive just punishment for your arrogance.
37 I, like my brothers, give up body and life for the laws of our fathers, appealing to God to show mercy soon to our nation and by afflictions and plagues to make you confess that he alone is God,
38 and through me and my brothers to bring to an end the wrath of the Almighty which has justly fallen on our whole nation.”
39 The king fell into a rage, and handled him worse than the others, being exasperated at his scorn.
40 So he died in his integrity, putting his whole trust in the Lord.
41 Last of all, the mother died, after her sons.
42 Let this be enough, then, about the eating of sacrifices and the extreme tortures.


# Liber Secundus Machabaeorum 7 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Contigit autem et septem fratres una cum matre sua apprehensos compelli a rege edere contra fas carnes porcinas, flagris et taureis cruciatos.
2 Unus autem ex illis, qui erat primus, sic ait: Quid quæris, et quid vis discere a nobis? parati sumus mori, magis quam patrias Dei leges prævaricari.
3 Iratus itaque rex, jussit sartagines et ollas æneas succendi: quibus statim succensis,
4 jussit ei qui prior fuerat locutus amputari linguam, et cute capitis abstracta, summas quoque manus et pedes ei præscindi, ceteris ejus fratribus et matre inspicientibus.
5 Et cum jam per omnia inutilis factus esset, jussit ignem admoveri, et adhuc spirantem torreri in sartagine: in qua cum diu cruciaretur, ceteri una cum matre invicem se hortabantur mori fortiter,
6 dicentes: Dominus Deus aspiciet veritatem, et consolabitur in nobis, quemadmodum in protestatione cantici declaravit Moyses: Et in servis suis consolabitur.

7 Mortuo itaque illo primo hoc modo, sequentem deducebant ad illudendum: et cute capitis ejus cum capillis abstracta, interrogabant si manducaret, priusquam toto corpore per membra singula puniretur.
8 At ille respondens patria voce, dixit: Non faciam. Propter quod et iste, sequenti loco, primi tormenta suscepit:
9 et in ultimo spiritu constitutus, sic ait: Tu quidem scelestissime in præsenti vita nos perdis: sed Rex mundi defunctos nos pro suis legibus in æternæ vitæ resurrectione suscitabit.
10 Post hunc tertius illuditur, et linguam postulatus cito protulit, et manus constanter extendit:
11 et cum fiducia ait: E cælo ista possideo, sed propter Dei leges nunc hæc ipsa despicio, quoniam ab ipso me ea recepturum spero:
12 ita ut rex, et qui cum ipso erant, mirarentur adolescentis animum, quod tamquam nihilum duceret cruciatus.
13 Et hoc ita defuncto, quartum vexabant similiter torquentes.
14 Et cum jam esset ad mortem, sic ait: Potius est ab hominibus morti datos spem exspectare a Deo, iterum ab ipso resuscitandos: tibi enim resurrectio ad vitam non erit.
15 Et cum admovissent quintum, vexabant eum. At ille respiciens in eum,
16 dixit: Potestatem inter homines habens, cum sis corruptibilis, facis quod vis: noli autem putare genus nostrum a Deo esse derelictum:
17 tu autem patienter sustine, et videbis magnam potestatem ipsius, qualiter te et semen tuum torquebit.
18 Post hunc ducebant sextum, et is, mori incipiens, sic ait: Noli frustra errare: nos enim propter nosmetipsos hæc patimur, peccantes in Deum nostrum, et digna admiratione facta sunt in nobis:
19 tu autem ne existimes tibi impune futurum, quod contra Deum pugnare tentaveris.

20 Supra modum autem mater mirabilis, et bonorum memoria digna, quæ pereuntes septem filios sub unius diei tempore conspiciens, bono animo ferebat propter spem quam in Deum habebat:
21 singulos illorum hortabatur voce patria fortiter, repleta sapientia: et, femineæ cogitationi masculinum animum inserens,
22 dixit ad eos: Nescio qualiter in utero meo apparuistis, neque enim ego spiritum et animam donavi vobis et vitam, et singulorum membra non ego ipsa compegi:
23 sed enim mundi Creator, qui formavit hominis nativitatem, quique omnium invenit originem, et spiritum vobis iterum cum misericordia reddet et vitam, sicut nunc vosmetipsos despicitis propter leges ejus.

24 Antiochus autem, contemni se arbitratus, simul et exprobrantis voce despecta, cum adhuc adolescentior superesset, non solum verbis hortabatur, sed et cum juramento affirmabat se divitem et beatum facturum, et translatum a patriis legibus amicum habiturum, et res necessarias ei præbiturum.
25 Sed ad hæc cum adolescens nequaquam inclinaretur, vocavit rex matrem, et suadebat ei ut adolescenti fieret in salutem.
26 Cum autem multis eam verbis esset hortatus, promisit suasurum se filio suo.
27 Itaque inclinata ad illum, irridens crudelem tyrannum, ait patria voce: Fili mi, miserere mei, quæ te in utero novem mensibus portavi, et lac triennio dedi et alui, et in ætatem istam perduxi.
28 Peto, nate, ut aspicias ad cælum et terram, et ad omnia quæ in eis sunt, et intelligas quia ex nihilo fecit illa Deus, et hominum genus:
29 ita fiet, ut non timeas carnificem istum, sed dignus fratribus tuis effectus particeps, suscipe mortem, ut in illa miseratione cum fratribus tuis te recipiam.

30 Cum hæc illa adhuc diceret, ait adolescens: Quem sustinetis? non obedio præcepto regis, sed præcepto legis, quæ data est nobis per Moysen.
31 Tu vero, qui inventor omnis malitiæ factus es in Hebræos, non effugies manum Dei.
32 Nos enim pro peccatis nostris hæc patimur.
33 Et si nobis propter increpationem et correptionem Dominus Deus noster modicum iratus est: sed iterum reconciliabitur servis suis.
34 Tu autem, o sceleste, et omnium hominum flagitiosissime, noli frustra extolli vanis spebus in servos ejus inflammatus:
35 nondum enim omnipotentis Dei, et omnia inspicientis, judicium effugisti.
36 Nam fratres mei, modico nunc dolore sustentato, sub testamento æternæ vitæ effecti sunt: tu vero judicio Dei justas superbiæ tuæ pœnas exsolves.
37 Ego autem, sicut fratres mei, animam et corpus meum trado pro patriis legibus, invocans Deum maturius genti nostræ propitium fieri, teque cum tormentis et verberibus confiteri quod ipse est Deus solus.
38 In me vero et in fratribus meis desinet Omnipotentis ira, quæ super omne genus nostrum juste superducta est.

39 Tunc rex accensus ira in hunc, super omnes crudelius desævit, indigne ferens se derisum.
40 Et hic itaque mundus obiit, per omnia in Domino confidens.
41 Novissime autem post filios, et mater consumpta est.

42 Igitur de sacrificiis et de nimiis crudelitatibus satis dictum est.


# Μακκαβαίων Βʹ 7 (Septuagint)

1 συνέβη δὲ καὶ ἑπτὰ ἀδελφοὺς μετὰ τῆς μητρὸς συλλημφθέντας ἀναγκάζεσθαι ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως ἀπὸ τῶν ἀθεμίτων ὑείων κρεῶν ἐφάπτεσθαι μάστιξιν καὶ νευραῖς αἰκιζομένους
2 εἷς δὲ αὐτῶν γενόμενος προήγορος οὕτως ἔφη τί μέλλεις ἐρωτᾶν καὶ μανθάνειν ἡμῶν ἕτοιμοι γὰρ ἀποθνῄσκειν ἐσμὲν ἢ παραβαίνειν τοὺς πατρίους νόμους
3 ἔκθυμος δὲ γενόμενος ὁ βασιλεὺς προσέταξεν τήγανα καὶ λέβητας ἐκπυροῦν
4 τῶν δὲ παραχρῆμα ἐκπυρωθέντων τὸν γενόμενον αὐτῶν προήγορον προσέταξεν γλωσσοτομεῖν καὶ περισκυθίσαντας ἀκρωτηριάζειν τῶν λοιπῶν ἀδελφῶν καὶ τῆς μητρὸς συνορώντων
5 ἄχρηστον δὲ αὐτὸν τοῖς ὅλοις γενόμενον ἐκέλευσεν τῇ πυρᾷ προσάγειν ἔμπνουν καὶ τηγανίζειν τῆς δὲ ἀτμίδος ἐ{F'} ἱκανὸν διαδιδούσης τοῦ τηγάνου ἀλλήλους παρεκάλουν σὺν τῇ μητρὶ γενναίως τελευτᾶν λέγοντες οὕτως
6 ὁ κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἐφορᾷ καὶ ταῖς ἀληθείαις ἐ{F'} ἡμῖν παρακαλεῖται καθάπερ διὰ τῆς κατὰ πρόσωπον ἀντιμαρτυρούσης ᾠδῆς διεσάφησεν Μωυσῆς λέγων καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ παρακληθήσεται

7 μεταλλάξαντος δὲ τοῦ πρώτου τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον τὸν δεύτερον ἦγον ἐπὶ τὸν ἐμπαιγμὸν καὶ τὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς δέρμα σὺν ταῖς θριξὶν περισύραντες ἐπηρώτων εἰ φάγεσαι πρὸ τοῦ τιμωρηθῆναι τὸ σῶμα κατὰ μέλος
8 ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς τῇ πατρίῳ φωνῇ προσεῖπεν οὐχί διόπερ καὶ οὗτος τὴν ἑξῆς ἔλαβεν βάσανον ὡς ὁ πρῶτος
9 ἐν ἐσχάτῃ δὲ πνοῇ γενόμενος εἶπεν σὺ μέν ἀλάστωρ ἐκ τοῦ παρόντος ἡμᾶς ζῆν ἀπολύεις ὁ δὲ τοῦ κόσμου βασιλεὺς ἀποθανόντας ἡμᾶς ὑπὲρ τῶν αὐτοῦ νόμων εἰς αἰώνιον ἀναβίωσιν ζωῆς ἡμᾶς ἀναστήσει
10 μετὰ δὲ τοῦτον ὁ τρίτος ἐνεπαίζετο καὶ τὴν γλῶσσαν αἰτηθεὶς ταχέως προέβαλεν καὶ τὰς χεῖρας εὐθαρσῶς προέτεινεν
11 καὶ γενναίως εἶπεν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ταῦτα κέκτημαι καὶ διὰ τοὺς αὐτοῦ νόμους ὑπερορῶ ταῦτα καὶ πα{R'} αὐτοῦ ταῦτα πάλιν ἐλπίζω κομίσασθαι
12 ὥστε αὐτὸν τὸν βασιλέα καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ ἐκπλήσσεσθαι τὴν τοῦ νεανίσκου ψυχήν ὡς ἐν οὐδενὶ τὰς ἀλγηδόνας ἐτίθετο
13 καὶ τούτου δὲ μεταλλάξαντος τὸν τέταρτον ὡσαύτως ἐβασάνιζον αἰκιζόμενοι
14 καὶ γενόμενος πρὸς τὸ τελευτᾶν οὕτως ἔφη αἱρετὸν μεταλλάσσοντας ὑ{P'} ἀνθρώπων τὰς ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ προσδοκᾶν ἐλπίδας πάλιν ἀναστήσεσθαι ὑ{P'} αὐτοῦ σοὶ μὲν γὰρ ἀνάστασις εἰς ζωὴν οὐκ ἔσται
15 ἐχομένως δὲ τὸν πέμπτον προσάγοντες ᾐκίζοντο
16 ὁ δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἰδὼν εἶπεν ἐξουσίαν ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἔχων φθαρτὸς ὢν ὃ θέλεις ποιεῖς μὴ δόκει δὲ τὸ γένος ἡμῶν ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ καταλελεῖφθαι
17 σὺ δὲ καρτέρει καὶ θεώρει τὸ μεγαλεῖον αὐτοῦ κράτος ὡς σὲ καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου βασανιεῖ
18 μετὰ δὲ τοῦτον ἦγον τὸν ἕκτον καὶ μέλλων ἀποθνῄσκειν ἔφη μὴ πλανῶ μάτην ἡμεῖς γὰρ δ{I'} ἑαυτοὺς ταῦτα πάσχομεν ἁμαρτόντες εἰς τὸν ἑαυτῶν θεόν ἄξια θαυμασμοῦ γέγονεν
19 σὺ δὲ μὴ νομίσῃς ἀθῷος ἔσεσθαι θεομαχεῖν ἐπιχειρήσας

20 ὑπεραγόντως δὲ ἡ μήτηρ θαυμαστὴ καὶ μνήμης ἀγαθῆς ἀξία ἥτις ἀπολλυμένους υἱοὺς ἑπτὰ συνορῶσα μιᾶς ὑπὸ καιρὸν ἡμέρας εὐψύχως ἔφερεν διὰ τὰς ἐπὶ κύριον ἐλπίδας
21 ἕκαστον δὲ αὐτῶν παρεκάλει τῇ πατρίῳ φωνῇ γενναίῳ πεπληρωμένη φρονήματι καὶ τὸν θῆλυν λογισμὸν ἄρσενι θυμῷ διεγείρασα λέγουσα πρὸς αὐτούς
22 οὐκ οἶ{D'} ὅπως εἰς τὴν ἐμὴν ἐφάνητε κοιλίαν οὐδὲ ἐγὼ τὸ πνεῦμα καὶ τὴν ζωὴν ὑμῖν ἐχαρισάμην καὶ τὴν ἑκάστου στοιχείωσιν οὐκ ἐγὼ διερρύθμισα
23 τοιγαροῦν ὁ τοῦ κόσμου κτίστης ὁ πλάσας ἀνθρώπου γένεσιν καὶ πάντων ἐξευρὼν γένεσιν καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα καὶ τὴν ζωὴν ὑμῖν πάλιν ἀποδίδωσιν με{T'} ἐλέους ὡς νῦν ὑπερορᾶτε ἑαυτοὺς διὰ τοὺς αὐτοῦ νόμους

24 ὁ δὲ Ἀντίοχος οἰόμενος καταφρονεῖσθαι καὶ τὴν ὀνειδίζουσαν ὑφορώμενος φωνὴν ἔτι τοῦ νεωτέρου περιόντος οὐ μόνον διὰ λόγων ἐποιεῖτο τὴν παράκλησιν ἀλλὰ καὶ δ{I'} ὅρκων ἐπίστου ἅμα πλουτιεῖν καὶ μακαριστὸν ποιήσειν μεταθέμενον ἀπὸ τῶν πατρίων καὶ φίλον ἕξειν καὶ χρείας ἐμπιστεύσειν
25 τοῦ δὲ νεανίου μηδαμῶς προσέχοντος προσκαλεσάμενος ὁ βασιλεὺς τὴν μητέρα παρῄνει γενέσθαι τοῦ μειρακίου σύμβουλον ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ
26 πολλὰ δὲ αὐτοῦ παραινέσαντος ἐπεδέξατο πείσειν τὸν υἱόν
27 προσκύψασα δὲ αὐτῷ χλευάσασα τὸν ὠμὸν τύραννον οὕτως ἔφησεν τῇ πατρίῳ φωνῇ υἱέ ἐλέησόν με τὴν ἐν γαστρὶ περιενέγκασάν σε μῆνας ἐννέα καὶ θηλάσασάν σε ἔτη τρία καὶ ἐκθρέψασάν σε καὶ ἀγαγοῦσαν εἰς τὴν ἡλικίαν ταύτην καὶ τροφοφορήσασαν
28 ἀξιῶ σε τέκνον ἀναβλέψαντα εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς πάντα ἰδόντα γνῶναι ὅτι οὐκ ἐξ ὄντων ἐποίησεν αὐτὰ ὁ θεός καὶ τὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων γένος οὕτω γίνεται
29 μὴ φοβηθῇς τὸν δήμιον τοῦτον ἀλλὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἄξιος γενόμενος ἐπίδεξαι τὸν θάνατον ἵνα ἐν τῷ ἐλέει σὺν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς σου κομίσωμαί σε

30 ἔτι δὲ ταύτης καταληγούσης ὁ νεανίας εἶπεν τίνα μένετε οὐχ ὑπακούω τοῦ προστάγματος τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ δὲ προστάγματος ἀκούω τοῦ νόμου τοῦ δοθέντος τοῖς πατράσιν ἡμῶν διὰ Μωυσέως
31 σὺ δὲ πάσης κακίας εὑρετὴς γενόμενος εἰς τοὺς Εβραίους οὐ μὴ διαφύγῃς τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ θεοῦ
32 ἡμεῖς γὰρ διὰ τὰς ἑαυτῶν ἁμαρτίας πάσχομεν
33 εἰ δὲ χάριν ἐπιπλήξεως καὶ παιδείας ὁ ζῶν κύριος ἡμῶν βραχέως ἐπώργισται καὶ πάλιν καταλλαγήσεται τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ δούλοις
34 σὺ δέ ὦ ἀνόσιε καὶ πάντων ἀνθρώπων μιαρώτατε μὴ μάτην μετεωρίζου φρυαττόμενος ἀδήλοις ἐλπίσιν ἐπὶ τοὺς οὐρανίους παῖδας ἐπαιρόμενος χεῖρα
35 οὔπω γὰρ τὴν τοῦ παντοκράτορος ἐπόπτου θεοῦ κρίσιν ἐκπέφευγας
36 οἱ μὲν γὰρ νῦν ἡμέτεροι ἀδελφοὶ βραχὺν ὑπενέγκαντες πόνον ἀενάου ζωῆς ὑπὸ διαθήκην θεοῦ πεπτώκασιν σὺ δὲ τῇ τοῦ θεοῦ κρίσει δίκαια τὰ πρόστιμα τῆς ὑπερηφανίας ἀποίσῃ
37 ἐγὼ δέ καθάπερ οἱ ἀδελφοί καὶ σῶμα καὶ ψυχὴν προδίδωμι περὶ τῶν πατρίων νόμων ἐπικαλούμενος τὸν θεὸν ἵλεως ταχὺ τῷ ἔθνει γενέσθαι καὶ σὲ μετὰ ἐτασμῶν καὶ μαστίγων ἐξομολογήσασθαι διότι μόνος αὐτὸς θεός ἐστιν
38 ἐν ἐμοὶ δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου στῆσαι τὴν τοῦ παντοκράτορος ὀργὴν τὴν ἐπὶ τὸ σύμπαν ἡμῶν γένος δικαίως ἐπηγμένην

39 ἔκθυμος δὲ γενόμενος ὁ βασιλεὺς τούτῳ παρὰ τοὺς ἄλλους χειρίστως ἀπήντησεν πικρῶς φέρων ἐπὶ τῷ μυκτηρισμῷ
40 καὶ οὗτος οὖν καθαρὸς μετήλλαξεν παντελῶς ἐπὶ τῷ κυρίῳ πεποιθώς
41 ἐσχάτη δὲ τῶν υἱῶν ἡ μήτηρ ἐτελεύτησεν

42 τὰ μὲν οὖν περὶ τοὺς σπλαγχνισμοὺς καὶ τὰς ὑπερβαλλούσας αἰκίας ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον δεδηλώσθω
