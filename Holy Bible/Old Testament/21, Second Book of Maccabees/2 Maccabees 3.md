# Second Book of Maccabees 3 (RSVCE)

### Arrival of Heliodorus in Jerusalem
1 While the holy city was inhabited in unbroken peace and the laws were very well observed because of the piety of the high priest Oniʹas and his hatred of wickedness,
2 it came about that the kings themselves honored the place and glorified the temple with the finest presents,
3 so that even Seleuʹcus, the king of Asia, defrayed from his own revenues all the expenses connected with the service of the sacrifices.
4 But a man named Simon, of the tribe of Benjamin, who had been made captain of the temple, had a disagreement with the high priest about the administration of the city market;
5 and when he could not prevail over Oniʹas he went to Apolloʹnius of Tarsus, who at that time was governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicʹia.
6 He reported to him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of untold sums of money, so that the amount of the funds could not be reckoned, and that they did not belong to the account of the sacrifices, but that it was possible for them to fall under the control of the king.
7 When Apolloʹnius met the king, he told him of the money about which he had been informed. The king chose Heliodorʹus, who was in charge of his affairs, and sent him with commands to effect the removal of the aforesaid money.
8 Heliodorʹus at once set out on his journey, ostensibly to make a tour of inspection of the cities of Coelesyria and Phoenicʹia, but in fact to carry out the king’s purpose.
9 When he had arrived at Jerusalem and had been kindly welcomed by the high priest of the city, he told about the disclosure that had been made and stated why he had come, and he inquired whether this really was the situation.
10 The high priest explained that there were some deposits belonging to widows and orphans,
11 and also some money of Hyrcaʹnus, son of Tobiʹas, a man of very prominent position, and that it totaled in all four hundred talents of silver and two hundred of gold. To such an extent the impious Simon had misrepresented the facts.
12 And he said that it was utterly impossible that wrong should be done to those people who had trusted in the holiness of the place and in the sanctity and inviolability of the temple which is honored throughout the whole world.
13 But Heliodorʹus, because of the king’s commands which he had, said that this money must in any case be confiscated for the king’s treasury.
14 So he set a day and went in to direct the inspection of these funds. There was no little distress throughout the whole city.
15 The priests prostrated themselves before the altar in their priestly garments and called toward heaven upon him who had given the law about deposits, that he should keep them safe for those who had deposited them.
16 To see the appearance of the high priest was to be wounded at heart, for his face and the change in his color disclosed the anguish of his soul.
17 For terror and bodily trembling had come over the man, which plainly showed to those who looked at him the pain lodged in his heart.
18 People also hurried out of their houses in crowds to make a general supplication because the holy place was about to be brought into contempt.
19 Women, girded with sackcloth under their breasts, thronged the streets. Some of the maidens who were kept indoors ran together to the gates, and some to the walls, while others peered out of the windows.
20 And holding up their hands to heaven, they all made entreaty.
21 There was something pitiable in the prostration of the whole populace and the anxiety of the high priest in his great anguish.
### The Lord Protects His Temple
22 While they were calling upon the Almighty Lord that he would keep what had been entrusted safe and secure for those who had entrusted it,
23 Heliodorʹus went on with what had been decided.
24 But when he arrived at the treasury with his bodyguard, then and there the Sovereign of spirits and of all authority caused so great a manifestation that all who had been so bold as to accompany him were astounded by the power of God, and became faint with terror.
25 For there appeared to them a magnificently caparisoned horse, with a rider of frightening mien, and it rushed furiously at Heliodorʹus and struck at him with its front hoofs. Its rider was seen to have armor and weapons of gold.
26 Two young men also appeared to him, remarkably strong, gloriously beautiful and splendidly dressed, who stood on each side of him and scourged him continuously, inflicting many blows on him.
27 When he suddenly fell to the ground and deep darkness came over him, his men took him up and put him on a stretcher
28 and carried him away, this man who had just entered the aforesaid treasury with a great retinue and all his bodyguard but was now unable to help himself; and they recognized clearly the sovereign power of God.
29 While he lay prostrate, speechless because of the divine intervention and deprived of any hope of recovery,
30 they praised the Lord who had acted marvelously for his own place. And the temple, which a little while before was full of fear and disturbance, was filled with joy and gladness, now that the Almighty Lord had appeared.
### Onias Prays for Heliodorus
31 Quickly some of Heliodorʹus’ friends asked Oniʹas to call upon the Most High and to grant life to one who was lying quite at his last breath.
32 And the high priest, fearing that the king might get the notion that some foul play had been perpetrated by the Jews with regard to Heliodorʹus, offered sacrifice for the man’s recovery.
33 While the high priest was making the offering of atonement, the same young men appeared again to Heliodorʹus, dressed in the same clothing, and they stood and said, “Be very grateful to Oniʹas the high priest, since for his sake the Lord has granted you your life.
34 And see that you, who have been scourged by heaven, report to all men the majestic power of God.” Having said this they vanished.
### The Conversion of Heliodorus
35 Then Heliodorʹus offered sacrifice to the Lord and made very great vows to the Savior of his life, and having bidden Oniʹas farewell, he marched off with his forces to the king.
36 And he bore testimony to all men of the deeds of the supreme God, which he had seen with his own eyes.
37 When the king asked Heliodorʹus what sort of person would be suitable to send on another mission to Jerusalem, he replied,
38 “If you have any enemy or plotter against your government, send him there, for you will get him back thoroughly scourged, if he escapes at all, for there certainly is about the place some power of God.
39 For he who has his dwelling in heaven watches over that place himself and brings it aid, and he strikes and destroys those who come to do it injury.”
40 This was the outcome of the episode of Heliodorʹus and the protection of the treasury.


# Liber Secundus Machabaeorum 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Igitur cum sancta civitas habitaretur in omni pace, leges etiam adhuc optime custodirentur, propter Oniæ pontificis pietatem, et animos odio habentes mala,
2 fiebat ut et ipsi reges et principes locum summo honore dignum ducerent, et templum maximis muneribus illustrarent:
3 ita ut Seleucus Asiæ rex de redditibus suis præstaret omnes sumptus ad ministerium sacrificiorum pertinentes.
4 Simon autem de tribu Benjamin, præpositus templi constitutus, contendebat, obsistente sibi principe sacerdotum, iniquum aliquid in civitate moliri.
5 Sed cum vincere Oniam non posset, venit ad Apollonium Tharsææ filium, qui eo tempore erat dux Cœlesyriæ et Phœnicis:
6 et nuntiavit ei pecuniis innumerabilibus plenum esse ærarium Jerosolymis, et communes copias immensas esse, quæ non pertinent ad rationem sacrificiorum: esse autem possibile sub potestate regis cadere universa.

7 Cumque retulisset ad regem Apollonius de pecuniis quæ delatæ erant, illæ accitum Heliodorum, qui erat super negotia ejus, misit, cum mandatis ut prædictam pecuniam transportaret.
8 Statimque Heliodorus iter est agressus, specie quidem quasi per Cœlesyriam et Phœnicen civitates esset peragraturus, re vera autem regis propositum perfecturus.
9 Sed cum venisset Jerosolymam, et benigne a summo sacerdote in civitate esset exceptus, narravit de dato indicio pecuniarum, et cujus rei gratia adesset, aperuit: interrogabat autem si vere hæc ita essent.
10 Tunc summus sacerdos ostendit deposita esse hæc, et victualia viduarum et pupillorum:
11 quædam vero esse Hircani Tobiæ viri valde eminentis, in his quæ detulerat impius Simon: universa autem argenti talenta esse quadringenta, et auri ducenta:
12 decipi vero eos qui credidissent loco et templo quod per universum mundum honoratur pro sui veneratione et sanctitate, omnino impossibile esse.
13 At ille pro his quæ habebat in mandatis a rege, dicebat omni genere regi ea esse deferenda.

14 Constituta autem die, intrabat de his Heliodorus ordinaturus. Non modica vero per universam civitatem erat trepidatio.
15 Sacerdotes autem ante altare cum stolis sacerdotalibus jactaverunt se, et invocabant de cælo eum qui de depositis legem posuit, ut his qui deposuerant ea salva custodiret.
16 Jam vero qui videbat summi sacerdotis vultum, mente vulnerabatur: facies enim et color immutatus declarabat internum animi dolorem:
17 circumfusa enim erat mœstitia quædam viro, et horror corporis, per quem manifestus aspicientibus dolor cordis ejus efficiebatur.
18 Alii etiam gregatim de domibus confluebant, publica supplicatione obsecrantes, pro eo quod in contemptum locus esset venturus.
19 Accinctæque mulieres ciliciis pectus, per plateas confluebant: sed et virgines quæ conclusæ erant, procurrebant ad Oniam, aliæ autem ad muros, quædam vero per fenestras aspiciebant:
20 universæ autem protendentes manus in cælum, deprecabantur:
21 erat enim misera commistæ multitudinis, et magni sacerdotis in agone constituti exspectatio.

22 Et hi quidem invocabant omnipotentem Deum, ut credita sibi his qui crediderant, cum omni integritate conservarentur.
23 Heliodorus autem, quod decreverat, perficiebat eodem loco ipse cum satellitibus circa ærarium præsens.
24 Sed spiritus omnipotentis Dei magnam fecit suæ ostensionis evidentiam, ita ut omnes qui ausi fuerant parere ei, ruentes Dei virtute, in dissolutionem et formidinem converterentur.
25 Apparuit enim illis quidam equus terribilem habens sessorem, optimis operimentis adornatus: isque cum impetu Heliodoro priores calces elisit: qui autem ei sedebat, videbatur arma habere aurea.
26 Alii etiam apparuerunt duo juvenes virtute decori, optimi gloria, speciosique amictu: qui circumsteterunt eum, et ex utraque parte flagellabant, sine intermissione multis plagis verberantes.
27 Subito autem Heliodorus concidit in terram, eumque multa caligine circumfusum rapuerunt, atque in sella gestatoria positum ejecerunt.
28 Et is, qui cum multis cursoribus et satellitibus prædictum ingressus est ærarium, portabatur nullo sibi auxilium ferente, manifesta Dei cognita virtute:
29 et ille quidem per divinam virtutem jacebat mutus, atque omni spe et salute privatus.
30 Hi autem Dominum benedicebant, quia magnificabat locum suum: et templum, quod paulo ante timore ac tumultu erat plenum, apparente omnipotente Domino, gaudio et lætitia impletum est.

31 Tunc vero ex amicis Heliodori quidam rogabant confestim Oniam, ut invocaret Altissimum ut vitam donaret ei qui in supremo spiritu erat constitutus.
32 Considerans autem summus sacerdos ne forte rex suspicaretur malitiam aliquam ex Judæis circa Heliodorum consummatum, obtulit pro salute viri hostiam salutarem.
33 Cumque summus sacerdos exoraret, iidem juvenes eisdem vestibus amicti astantes Heliodoro, dixerunt: Oniæ sacerdoti gratias age: nam propter eum Dominus tibi vitam donavit.
34 Tu autem a Deo flagellatus, nuntia omnibus magnalia Dei, et potestatem. Et his dictis, non comparuerunt.
35 Heliodorus autem, hostia Deo oblata, et votis magnis promissis ei qui vivere illi concessit, et Oniæ gratias agens, recepto exercitu, repedabat ad regem.
36 Testabatur autem omnibus ea quæ sub oculis suis viderat opera magni Dei.
37 Cum autem rex interrogasset Heliodorum, quis esset aptus adhuc semel Jerosolymam mitti, ait:
38 Si quem habes hostem, aut regni tui insidiatorem, mitte illuc, et flagellatum eum recipies, si tamen evaserit: eo quod in loco sit vere Dei quædam virtus.
39 Nam ipse, qui habet in cælis habitationem, visitator et adjutor est loci illius, et venientes ad malefaciendum percutit ac perdit.

40 Igitur de Heliodoro et ærarii custodia ita res se habet.
