# Book of Isaiah 53 (RSVCE)

1 Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of theLordbeen revealed?
2 For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.
3 He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows,vand acquainted with grief;w and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
4 Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows;y yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.
5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed.
6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and theLordhas laid on him the iniquity of us all.
7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.
8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people?
9 And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.
10 Yet it was the will of theLordto bruise him; he has put him to grief;z when he makes himselfaan offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days; the will of theLordshall prosper in his hand;
11 he shall see the fruit of the travail of his soul and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous; and he shall bear their iniquities.
12 Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.


# Prophetia Isaiae 53 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Quis credidit auditui nostro?et brachium Domini cui revelatum est?
2 Et ascendet sicut virgultum coram eo,et sicut radix de terra sitienti.Non est species ei, neque decor,et vidimus eum,et non erat aspectus, et desideravimus eum:
3 despectum, et novissimum virorum,virum dolorum, et scientem infirmitatem,et quasi absconditus vultus ejus et despectus,unde nec reputavimus eum.
4 Vere languores nostros ipse tulit,et dolores nostros ipse portavit;et nos putavimus eum quasi leprosum,et percussum a Deo, et humiliatum.
5 Ipse autem vulneratus est propter iniquitates nostras;attritus est propter scelera nostra:disciplina pacis nostræ super eum,et livore ejus sanati sumus.
6 Omnes nos quasi oves erravimus,unusquisque in viam suam declinavit:et posuit Dominus in eoiniquitatem omnium nostrum.

7 Oblatus est quia ipse voluit,et non aperuit os suum;sicut ovis ad occisionem ducetur,et quasi agnus coram tondente se obmutescet,et non aperiet os suum.
8 De angustia, et de judicio sublatus est.Generationem ejus quis enarrabit?quia abscissus est de terra viventium:propter scelus populi mei percussi eum.
9 Et dabit impios pro sepultura,et divitem pro morte sua,eo quod iniquitatem non fecerit,neque dolus fuerit in ore ejus.
10 Et Dominus voluit conterere eum in infirmitate.Si posuerit pro peccato animam suam,videbit semen longævum,et voluntas Domini in manu ejus dirigetur.
11 Pro eo quod laboravit anima ejus,videbit et saturabitur.In scientia sua justificabitipse justus servus meus multos,et iniquitates eorum ipse portabit.
12 Ideo dispertiam ei plurimos,et fortium dividet spolia,pro eo quod tradidit in mortem animam suam,et cum sceleratis reputatus est,et ipse peccata multorum tulit,et pro transgressoribus rogavit.


# Ἠσαΐας 53 (Septuagint)

1 κύριε τίς ἐπίστευσεν τῇ ἀκοῇ ἡμῶν καὶ ὁ βραχίων κυρίου τίνι ἀπεκαλύφθη
2 ἀνηγγείλαμεν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ὡς παιδίον ὡς ῥίζα ἐν γῇ διψώσῃ οὐκ ἔστιν εἶδος αὐτῷ οὐδὲ δόξα καὶ εἴδομεν αὐτόν καὶ οὐκ εἶχεν εἶδος οὐδὲ κάλλος
3 ἀλλὰ τὸ εἶδος αὐτοῦ ἄτιμον ἐκλεῖπον παρὰ πάντας ἀνθρώπους ἄνθρωπος ἐν πληγῇ ὢν καὶ εἰδὼς φέρειν μαλακίαν ὅτι ἀπέστραπται τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἠτιμάσθη καὶ οὐκ ἐλογίσθη
4 οὗτος τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν φέρει καὶ περὶ ἡμῶν ὀδυνᾶται καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐλογισάμεθα αὐτὸν εἶναι ἐν πόνῳ καὶ ἐν πληγῇ καὶ ἐν κακώσει
5 αὐτὸς δὲ ἐτραυματίσθη διὰ τὰς ἀνομίας ἡμῶν καὶ μεμαλάκισται διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν παιδεία εἰρήνης ἡμῶν ἐ{P'} αὐτόν τῷ μώλωπι αὐτοῦ ἡμεῖς ἰάθημεν
6 πάντες ὡς πρόβατα ἐπλανήθημεν ἄνθρωπος τῇ ὁδῷ αὐτοῦ ἐπλανήθη καὶ κύριος παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ἡμῶν

7 καὶ αὐτὸς διὰ τὸ κεκακῶσθαι οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη καὶ ὡς ἀμνὸς ἐναντίον τοῦ κείροντος αὐτὸν ἄφωνος οὕτως οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ
8 ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει ἡ κρίσις αὐτοῦ ἤρθη τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται ὅτι αἴρεται ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἡ ζωὴ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνομιῶν τοῦ λαοῦ μου ἤχθη εἰς θάνατον
9 καὶ δώσω τοὺς πονηροὺς ἀντὶ τῆς ταφῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς πλουσίους ἀντὶ τοῦ θανάτου αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἀνομίαν οὐκ ἐποίησεν οὐδὲ εὑρέθη δόλος ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ
10 καὶ κύριος βούλεται καθαρίσαι αὐτὸν τῆς πληγῆς ἐὰν δῶτε περὶ ἁμαρτίας ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν ὄψεται σπέρμα μακρόβιον καὶ βούλεται κύριος ἀφελεῖν
11 ἀπὸ τοῦ πόνου τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ δεῖξαι αὐτῷ φῶς καὶ πλάσαι τῇ συνέσει δικαιῶσαι δίκαιον εὖ δουλεύοντα πολλοῖς καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν αὐτὸς ἀνοίσει
12 διὰ τοῦτο αὐτὸς κληρονομήσει πολλοὺς καὶ τῶν ἰσχυρῶν μεριεῖ σκῦλα ἀν{Q'} ὧν παρεδόθη εἰς θάνατον ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀνόμοις ἐλογίσθη καὶ αὐτὸς ἁμαρτίας πολλῶν ἀνήνεγκεν καὶ διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν παρεδόθη
