# Book of Isaiah 39 (RSVCE)

### Envoys from Babylon Welcomed
1 At that time Meroʹdach-balʹadan the son of Balʹadan, king of Babylon, sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiʹah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
2 And Hezekiʹah welcomed them; and he showed them his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his whole armory, all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiʹah did not show them.
3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiʹah, and said to him, “What did these men say? And whence did they come to you?” Hezekiʹah said, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.”
4 He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiʹah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”
5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiʹah, “Hear the word of theLordof hosts:
6 Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says theLord.
7 And some of your own sons, who are born to you, shall be taken away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
8 Then said Hezekiʹah to Isaiah, “The word of theLordwhich you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “There will be peace and security in my days.”


# Prophetia Isaiae 39 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In tempore illo misit Merodach Baladan, filius Baladan, rex Babylonis, libros et munera ad Ezechiam: audierat enim quod ægrotasset et convaluisset.
2 Lætatus est autem super eis Ezechias, et ostendit eis cellam aromatum, et argenti, et auri, et odoramentorum, et unguenti optimi, et omnes apothecas supellectilis suæ, et universa quæ inventa sunt in thesauris ejus. Non fuit verbum quod non ostenderet eis Ezechias in domo sua, et in omni potestate sua.

3 Introivit autem Isaias propheta ad Ezechiam regem, et dixit ei: Quid dixerunt viri isti, et unde venerunt ad te? Et dixit Ezechias: De terra longinqua venerunt ad me, de Babylone.
4 Et dixit: Quid viderunt in domo tua? Et dixit Ezechias: Omnia quæ in domo mea sunt viderunt; non fuit res quam non ostenderim eis in thesauris meis.
5 Et dixit Isaias ad Ezechiam: Audi verbum Domini exercituum.
6 Ecce dies venient, et auferentur omnia quæ in domo tua sunt, et quæ thesaurizaverunt patres tui usque ad diem hanc, in Babylonem; non relinquetur quidquam, dicit Dominus.
7 Et de filiis tuis, qui exibunt de te, quos genueris, tollent, et erunt eunuchi in palatio regis Babylonis.
8 Et dixit Ezechias ad Isaiam: Bonum verbum Domini, quod locutus est. Et dixit: Fiat tantum pax et veritas in diebus meis!


# Ἠσαΐας 39 (Septuagint)

1 ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀπέστειλεν Μαρωδαχ υἱὸς τοῦ Λααδαν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῆς Βαβυλωνίας ἐπιστολὰς καὶ πρέσβεις καὶ δῶρα Εζεκια ἤκουσεν γὰρ ὅτι ἐμαλακίσθη ἕως θανάτου καὶ ἀνέστη
2 καὶ ἐχάρη ἐ{P'} αὐτοῖς Εζεκιας χαρὰν μεγάλην καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ νεχωθα καὶ τῆς στακτῆς καὶ τῶν θυμιαμάτων καὶ τοῦ μύρου καὶ τοῦ ἀργυρίου καὶ τοῦ χρυσίου καὶ πάντας τοὺς οἴκους τῶν σκευῶν τῆς γάζης καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἦν οὐθέν ὃ οὐκ ἔδειξεν Εζεκιας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ

3 καὶ ἦλθεν Ησαιας ὁ προφήτης πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Εζεκιαν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν τί λέγουσιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὗτοι καὶ πόθεν ἥκασιν πρὸς σέ καὶ εἶπεν Εζεκιας ἐκ γῆς πόρρωθεν ἥκασιν πρός με ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος
4 καὶ εἶπεν Ησαιας τί εἴδοσαν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου καὶ εἶπεν Εζεκιας πάντα τὰ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου εἴδοσαν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου ὃ οὐκ εἴδοσαν ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς μου
5 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ησαιας ἄκουσον τὸν λόγον κυρίου σαβαωθ
6 ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται λέγει κύριος καὶ λήμψονται πάντα τὰ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου καὶ ὅσα συνήγαγον οἱ πατέρες σου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ἥξει καὶ οὐδὲν οὐ μὴ καταλίπωσιν εἶπεν δὲ ὁ θεὸς
7 ὅτι καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν τέκνων σου ὧν ἐγέννησας λήμψονται καὶ ποιήσουσιν σπάδοντας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν Βαβυλωνίων
8 καὶ εἶπεν Εζεκιας πρὸς Ησαιαν ἀγαθὸς ὁ λόγος κυρίου ὃν ἐλάλησεν γενέσθω δὴ εἰρήνη καὶ δικαιοσύνη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις μου
