# First Book of Samuel 16 (RSVCE)

### David Anointed as King
1 TheLordsaid to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.”
2 And Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” And theLordsaid, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to theLord.’
3 And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me him whom I name to you.”
4 Samuel did what theLordcommanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”
5 And he said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to theLord; consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.
6 When they came, he looked on Eliʹab and thought, “Surely theLord’s anointed is before him.”
7 But theLordsaid to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for theLordsees not as man sees; man looks on the outward appearance, but theLordlooks on the heart.”
8 Then Jesse called Abinʹadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “Neither has theLordchosen this one.”
9 Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has theLordchosen this one.”
10 And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “TheLordhas not chosen these.”
11 And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he comes here.”
12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. And theLordsaid, “Arise, anoint him; for this is he.”
13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of theLordcame mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
### David Plays the Lyre for Saul
14 Now the Spirit of theLorddeparted from Saul, and an evil spirit from theLordtormented him.
15 And Saul’s servants said to him, “Behold now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.
16 Let our lord now command your servants, who are before you, to seek out a man who is skilful in playing the lyre; and when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well.”
17 So Saul said to his servants, “Provide for me a man who can play well, and bring him to me.”
18 One of the young men answered, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skilful in playing, a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and theLordis with him.”
19 Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.”
20 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a skin of wine and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.
21 And David came to Saul, and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.
22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight.”
23 And whenever the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand; so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 16 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dixitque Dominus ad Samuelem: Usquequo tu luges Saul, cum ego projecerim eum ne regnet super Israël? Imple cornu tuum oleo, et veni, ut mittam te ad Isai Bethlehemitem: providi enim in filiis ejus mihi regem.
2 Et ait Samuel: Quomodo vadam? audiet enim Saul, et interficiet me. Et ait Dominus: Vitulum de armento tolles in manu tua, et dices: Ad immolandum Domino veni.
3 Et vocabis Isai ad victimam, et ego ostendam tibi quid facias, et unges quemcumque monstravero tibi.

4 Fecit ergo Samuel sicut locutus est ei Dominus. Venitque in Bethlehem, et admirati sunt seniores civitatis occurrentes ei: dixeruntque: Pacificusne est ingressus tuus?
5 Et ait: Pacificus: ad immolandum Domino veni: sanctificamini, et venite mecum ut immolem. Sanctificavit ergo Isai et filios ejus, et vocavit eos ad sacrificium.
6 Cumque ingressi essent, vidit Eliab, et ait: Num coram Domino est christus ejus?
7 Et dixit Dominus ad Samuelem: Ne respicias vultum ejus, neque altitudinem staturæ ejus: quoniam abjeci eum, nec juxta intuitum hominis ego judico: homo enim videt ea quæ parent, Dominus autem intuetur cor.
8 Et vocavit Isai Abinadab, et adduxit eum coram Samuele. Qui dixit: Nec hunc elegit Dominus.
9 Adduxit autem Isai Samma, de quo ait: Etiam hunc non elegit Dominus.
10 Adduxit itaque Isai septem filios suos coram Samuele: et ait Samuel ad Isai: Non elegit Dominus ex istis.
11 Dixitque Samuel ad Isai: Numquid jam completi sunt filii? Qui respondit: Adhuc reliquus est parvulus, et pascit oves. Et ait Samuel ad Isai: Mitte, et adduc eum: nec enim discumbemus priusquam huc ille veniat.
12 Misit ergo, et adduxit eum. Erat autem rufus, et pulcher aspectu, decoraque facie: et ait Dominus: Surge, unge eum: ipse est enim.
13 Tulit ergo Samuel cornu olei, et unxit eum in medio fratrum ejus: et directus est spiritus Domini a die illa in David, et deinceps. Surgensque Samuel abiit in Ramatha.

14 Spiritus autem Domini recessit a Saul, et exagitabat eum spiritus nequam a Domino.
15 Dixeruntque servi Saul ad eum: Ecce spiritus Dei malus exagitat te.
16 Jubeat dominus noster, et servi tui qui coram te sunt quærent hominem scientem psallere cithara, ut quando arripuerit te spiritus Domini malus, psallat manu sua, et levius feras.
17 Et ait Saul ad servos suos: Providete ergo mihi aliquem bene psallentem, et adducite eum ad me.
18 Et respondens unus de pueris, ait: Ecce vidi filium Isai Bethlehemitem scientem psallere, et fortissimum robore, et virum bellicosum, et prudentem in verbis, et virum pulchrum: et Dominus est cum eo.
19 Misit ergo Saul nuntios ad Isai, dicens: Mitte ad me David filium tuum, qui est in pascuis.
20 Tulit itaque Isai asinum plenum panibus, et lagenam vini, et hædum de capris unum, et misit per manum David filii sui Sauli.
21 Et venit David ad Saul, et stetit coram eo: at ille dilexit eum nimis, et factus est ejus armiger.
22 Misitque Saul ad Isai, dicens: Stet David in conspectu meo: invenit enim gratiam in oculis meis.
23 Igitur quandocumque spiritus Domini malus arripiebat Saul, David tollebat citharam, et percutiebat manu sua, et refocillabatur Saul, et levius habebat: recedebat enim ab eo spiritus malus.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 16 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Σαμουηλ ἕως πότε σὺ πενθεῖς ἐπὶ Σαουλ κἀγὼ ἐξουδένωκα αὐτὸν μὴ βασιλεύειν ἐπὶ Ισραηλ πλῆσον τὸ κέρας σου ἐλαίου καὶ δεῦρο ἀποστείλω σε πρὸς Ιεσσαι ἕως εἰς Βηθλεεμ ὅτι ἑόρακα ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ ἐμοὶ βασιλεύειν
2 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ πῶς πορευθῶ καὶ ἀκούσεται Σαουλ καὶ ἀποκτενεῖ με καὶ εἶπεν κύριος δάμαλιν βοῶν λαβὲ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου καὶ ἐρεῖς θῦσαι τῷ κυρίῳ ἥκω
3 καὶ καλέσεις τὸν Ιεσσαι εἰς τὴν θυσίαν καὶ γνωριῶ σοι ἃ ποιήσεις καὶ χρίσεις ὃν ἐὰν εἴπω πρὸς σέ

4 καὶ ἐποίησεν Σαμουηλ πάντα ἃ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ κύριος καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Βηθλεεμ καὶ ἐξέστησαν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τῆς πόλεως τῇ ἀπαντήσει αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπαν εἰρήνη ἡ εἴσοδός σου ὁ βλέπων
5 καὶ εἶπεν εἰρήνη θῦσαι τῷ κυρίῳ ἥκω ἁγιάσθητε καὶ εὐφράνθητε με{T'} ἐμοῦ σήμερον καὶ ἡγίασεν τὸν Ιεσσαι καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν θυσίαν
6 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ αὐτοὺς εἰσιέναι καὶ εἶδεν τὸν Ελιαβ καὶ εἶπεν ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐνώπιον κυρίου χριστὸς αὐτοῦ
7 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Σαμουηλ μὴ ἐπιβλέψῃς ἐπὶ τὴν ὄψιν αὐτοῦ μηδὲ εἰς τὴν ἕξιν μεγέθους αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐξουδένωκα αὐτόν ὅτι οὐχ ὡς ἐμβλέψεται ἄνθρωπος ὄψεται ὁ θεός ὅτι ἄνθρωπος ὄψεται εἰς πρόσωπον ὁ δὲ θεὸς ὄψεται εἰς καρδίαν
8 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ιεσσαι τὸν Αμιναδαβ καὶ παρῆλθεν κατὰ πρόσωπον Σαμουηλ καὶ εἶπεν οὐδὲ τοῦτον ἐξελέξατο κύριος
9 καὶ παρήγαγεν Ιεσσαι τὸν Σαμα καὶ εἶπεν καὶ ἐν τούτῳ οὐκ ἐξελέξατο κύριος
10 καὶ παρήγαγεν Ιεσσαι τοὺς ἑπτὰ υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐνώπιον Σαμουηλ καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ οὐκ ἐξελέξατο κύριος ἐν τούτοις
11 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ πρὸς Ιεσσαι ἐκλελοίπασιν τὰ παιδάρια καὶ εἶπεν ἔτι ὁ μικρὸς ἰδοὺ ποιμαίνει ἐν τῷ ποιμνίῳ καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ πρὸς Ιεσσαι ἀπόστειλον καὶ λαβὲ αὐτόν ὅτι οὐ μὴ κατακλιθῶμεν ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν αὐτόν
12 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτόν καὶ οὗτος πυρράκης μετὰ κάλλους ὀφθαλμῶν καὶ ἀγαθὸς ὁράσει κυρίῳ καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Σαμουηλ ἀνάστα καὶ χρῖσον τὸν Δαυιδ ὅτι οὗτος ἀγαθός ἐστιν
13 καὶ ἔλαβεν Σαμουηλ τὸ κέρας τοῦ ἐλαίου καὶ ἔχρισεν αὐτὸν ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐφήλατο πνεῦμα κυρίου ἐπὶ Δαυιδ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης καὶ ἐπάνω καὶ ἀνέστη Σαμουηλ καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς Αρμαθαιμ

14 καὶ πνεῦμα κυρίου ἀπέστη ἀπὸ Σαουλ καὶ ἔπνιγεν αὐτὸν πνεῦμα πονηρὸν παρὰ κυρίου
15 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ παῖδες Σαουλ πρὸς αὐτόν ἰδοὺ δὴ πνεῦμα κυρίου πονηρὸν πνίγει σε
16 εἰπάτωσαν δὴ οἱ δοῦλοί σου ἐνώπιόν σου καὶ ζητησάτωσαν τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν ἄνδρα εἰδότα ψάλλειν ἐν κινύρᾳ καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ εἶναι πνεῦμα πονηρὸν ἐπὶ σοὶ καὶ ψαλεῖ ἐν τῇ κινύρᾳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀγαθόν σοι ἔσται καὶ ἀναπαύσει σε
17 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ ἴδετε δή μοι ἄνδρα ὀρθῶς ψάλλοντα καὶ εἰσαγάγετε αὐτὸν πρὸς ἐμέ
18 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη εἷς τῶν παιδαρίων αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἑόρακα υἱὸν τῷ Ιεσσαι Βηθλεεμίτην καὶ αὐτὸν εἰδότα ψαλμόν καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ συνετός καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ πολεμιστὴς καὶ σοφὸς λόγῳ καὶ ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς τῷ εἴδει καὶ κύριος με{T'} αὐτοῦ
19 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σαουλ ἀγγέλους πρὸς Ιεσσαι λέγων ἀπόστειλον πρός με τὸν υἱόν σου Δαυιδ τὸν ἐν τῷ ποιμνίῳ σου
20 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ιεσσαι γομορ ἄρτων καὶ ἀσκὸν οἴνου καὶ ἔριφον αἰγῶν ἕνα καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν ἐν χειρὶ Δαυιδ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ πρὸς Σαουλ
21 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Σαουλ καὶ παρειστήκει ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἠγάπησεν αὐτὸν σφόδρα καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ
22 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σαουλ πρὸς Ιεσσαι λέγων παριστάσθω δὴ Δαυιδ ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ ὅτι εὗρεν χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου
23 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ εἶναι πνεῦμα πονηρὸν ἐπὶ Σαουλ καὶ ἐλάμβανεν Δαυιδ τὴν κινύραν καὶ ἔψαλλεν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέψυχεν Σαουλ καὶ ἀγαθὸν αὐτῷ καὶ ἀφίστατο ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ πονηρόν
