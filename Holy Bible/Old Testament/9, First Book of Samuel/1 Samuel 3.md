# First Book of Samuel 3 (RSVCE)

### Samuel’s Calling and Prophetic Activity
1 Now the boy Samuel was ministering to theLordunder Eli. And the word of theLordwas rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.
2 At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place;
3 the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down within the temple of theLord, where the ark of God was.
4 Then theLordcalled, “Samuel! Samuel!” and he said, “Here I am!”
5 and ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” So he went and lay down.
6 And theLordcalled again, “Samuel!” and Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.”
7 Now Samuel did not yet know theLord, and the word of theLordhad not yet been revealed to him.
8 And theLordcalled Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that theLordwas calling the boy.
9 Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and if he calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak,Lord, for thy servant hears.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
10 And theLordcame and stood forth, calling as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for thy servant hears.”
11 Then theLordsaid to Samuel, “Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel, at which the two ears of every one that hears it will tingle.
12 On that day I will fulfil against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.
13 And I tell him that I am about to punish his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.
14 Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated by sacrifice or offering for ever.”
15 Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of theLord. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.
16 But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.”
17 And Eli said, “What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also, if you hide anything from me of all that he told you.”
18 So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is theLord; let him do what seems good to him.”
19 And Samuel grew, and theLordwas with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.
20 And all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of theLord.
21 And theLordappeared again at Shiloh, for theLordrevealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of theLord.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Puer autem Samuel ministrabat Domino coram Heli, et sermo Domini erat pretiosus in diebus illis: non erat visio manifesta.
2 Factum est ergo in die quadam, Heli jacebat in loco suo, et oculi ejus caligaverant, nec poterat videre:
3 lucerna Dei antequam extingueretur, Samuel dormiebat in templo Domini, ubi erat arca Dei.
4 Et vocavit Dominus Samuel. Qui respondens, ait: Ecce ego.
5 Et cucurrit ad Heli, et dixit: Ecce ego: vocasti enim me. Qui dixit: Non vocavi: revertere, et dormi. Et abiit, et dormivit.
6 Et adjecit Dominus rursum vocare Samuelem. Consurgensque Samuel, abiit ad Heli, et dixit: Ecce ego, quia vocasti me. Qui respondit: Non vocavi te, fili mi: revertere et dormi.
7 Porro Samuel necdum sciebat Dominum, neque revelatus fuerat ei sermo Domini.
8 Et adjecit Dominus, et vocavit adhuc Samuelem tertio. Qui consurgens abiit ad Heli,
9 et ait: Ecce ego, quia vocasti me. Intellexit ergo Heli quia Dominus vocaret puerum: et ait ad Samuelem: Vade, et dormi: et si deinceps vocaverit te, dices: Loquere, Domine, quia audit servus tuus. Abiit ergo Samuel, et dormivit in loco suo.

10 Et venit Dominus, et stetit: et vocavit, sicut vocaverat secundo: Samuel, Samuel. Et ait Samuel: Loquere, Domine, quia audit servus tuus.
11 Et dixit Dominus ad Samuelem: Ecce ego facio verbum in Israël, quod quicumque audierit, tinnient ambæ aures ejus.
12 In die illa suscitabo adversum Heli omnia quæ locutus sum super domum ejus: incipiam, et complebo.
13 Prædixi enim ei quod judicaturus essem domum ejus in æternum propter iniquitatem, eo quod noverat indigne agere filios suos, et non corripuerit eos.
14 Idcirco juravi domui Heli quod non expietur iniquitas domus ejus victimis et muneribus usque in æternum.

15 Dormivit autem Samuel usque mane, aperuitque ostia domus Domini. Et Samuel timebat indicare visionem Heli.
16 Vocavit ergo Heli Samuelem, et dixit: Samuel fili mi? Qui respondens ait: Præsto sum.
17 Et interrogavit eum: Quis est sermo, quem locutus est Dominus ad te? oro te ne celaveris me: hæc faciat tibi Deus, et hæc addat, si absconderis a me sermonem ex omnibus verbis quæ dicta sunt tibi.
18 Indicavit itaque ei Samuel universos sermones, et non abscondit ab eo. Et ille respondit: Dominus est: quod bonum est in oculis suis faciat.

19 Crevit autem Samuel, et Dominus erat cum eo, et non cecidit ex omnibus verbis ejus in terram.
20 Et cognovit universus Israël, a Dan usque Bersabee, quod fidelis Samuel propheta esset Domini.
21 Et addidit Dominus ut appareret in Silo, quoniam revelatus fuerat Dominus Samueli in Silo juxta verbum Domini. Et evenit sermo Samuelis universo Israëli.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 3 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ τὸ παιδάριον Σαμουηλ ἦν λειτουργῶν τῷ κυρίῳ ἐνώπιον Ηλι τοῦ ἱερέως καὶ ῥῆμα κυρίου ἦν τίμιον ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις οὐκ ἦν ὅρασις διαστέλλουσα
2 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ Ηλι ἐκάθευδεν ἐν τῷ τόπῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ἤρξαντο βαρύνεσθαι καὶ οὐκ ἠδύνατο βλέπειν
3 καὶ ὁ λύχνος τοῦ θεοῦ πρὶν ἐπισκευασθῆναι καὶ Σαμουηλ ἐκάθευδεν ἐν τῷ ναῷ οὗ ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ θεοῦ
4 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν κύριος Σαμουηλ Σαμουηλ καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγώ
5 καὶ ἔδραμεν πρὸς Ηλι καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγώ ὅτι κέκληκάς με καὶ εἶπεν οὐ κέκληκά σε ἀνάστρεφε κάθευδε καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν καὶ ἐκάθευδεν
6 καὶ προσέθετο κύριος καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Σαμουηλ Σαμουηλ καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς Ηλι τὸ δεύτερον καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγώ ὅτι κέκληκάς με καὶ εἶπεν οὐ κέκληκά σε ἀνάστρεφε κάθευδε
7 καὶ Σαμουηλ πρὶν ἢ γνῶναι θεὸν καὶ ἀποκαλυφθῆναι αὐτῷ ῥῆμα κυρίου
8 καὶ προσέθετο κύριος καλέσαι Σαμουηλ ἐν τρίτῳ καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς Ηλι καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγώ ὅτι κέκληκάς με καὶ ἐσοφίσατο Ηλι ὅτι κύριος κέκληκεν τὸ παιδάριον
9 καὶ εἶπεν ἀνάστρεφε κάθευδε τέκνον καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν καλέσῃ σε καὶ ἐρεῖς λάλει κύριε ὅτι ἀκούει ὁ δοῦλός σου καὶ ἐπορεύθη Σαμουηλ καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐν τῷ τόπῳ αὐτοῦ

10 καὶ ἦλθεν κύριος καὶ κατέστη καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν ὡς ἅπαξ καὶ ἅπαξ καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ λάλει ὅτι ἀκούει ὁ δοῦλός σου
11 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Σαμουηλ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ποιῶ τὰ ῥήματά μου ἐν Ισραηλ ὥστε παντὸς ἀκούοντος αὐτὰ ἠχήσει ἀμφότερα τὰ ὦτα αὐτοῦ
12 ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐπεγερῶ ἐπὶ Ηλι πάντα ὅσα ἐλάλησα εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ἄρξομαι καὶ ἐπιτελέσω
13 καὶ ἀνήγγελκα αὐτῷ ὅτι ἐκδικῶ ἐγὼ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ἕως αἰῶνος ἐν ἀδικίαις υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ὅτι κακολογοῦντες θεὸν υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐνουθέτει αὐτοὺς καὶ οὐ{D'} οὕτως
14 ὤμοσα τῷ οἴκῳ Ηλι εἰ ἐξιλασθήσεται ἀδικία οἴκου Ηλι ἐν θυμιάματι καὶ ἐν θυσίαις ἕως αἰῶνος

15 καὶ κοιμᾶται Σαμουηλ ἕως πρωὶ καὶ ὤρθρισεν τὸ πρωὶ καὶ ἤνοιξεν τὰς θύρας οἴκου κυρίου καὶ Σαμουηλ ἐφοβήθη ἀπαγγεῖλαι τὴν ὅρασιν τῷ Ηλι
16 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλι πρὸς Σαμουηλ Σαμουηλ τέκνον καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγώ
17 καὶ εἶπεν τί τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ λαληθὲν πρὸς σέ μὴ δὴ κρύψῃς ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ τάδε ποιήσαι σοι ὁ θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη ἐὰν κρύψῃς ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ ῥῆμα ἐκ πάντων τῶν λόγων τῶν λαληθέντων σοι ἐν τοῖς ὠσίν σου
18 καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν Σαμουηλ πάντας τοὺς λόγους καὶ οὐκ ἔκρυψεν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν Ηλι κύριος αὐτός τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ποιήσει

19 καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθη Σαμουηλ καὶ ἦν κύριος με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἔπεσεν ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν λόγων αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
20 καὶ ἔγνωσαν πᾶς Ισραηλ ἀπὸ Δαν καὶ ἕως Βηρσαβεε ὅτι πιστὸς Σαμουηλ εἰς προφήτην τῷ κυρίῳ
21 καὶ προσέθετο κύριος δηλωθῆναι ἐν Σηλωμ ὅτι ἀπεκαλύφθη κύριος πρὸς Σαμουηλ καὶ ἐπιστεύθη Σαμουηλ προφήτης γενέσθαι τῷ κυρίῳ εἰς πάντα Ισραηλ ἀ{P'} ἄκρων τῆς γῆς καὶ ἕως ἄκρων καὶ Ηλι πρεσβύτης σφόδρα καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ πορευόμενοι ἐπορεύοντο καὶ πονηρὰ ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτῶν ἐνώπιον κυρίου
