# First Book of Samuel 30 (RSVCE)

### David Avenges the Destruction of Ziklag
1 Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalʹekites had made a raid upon the Negeb and upon Ziklag. They had overcome Ziklag, and burned it with fire,
2 and taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great; they killed no one, but carried them off, and went their way.
3 And when David and his men came to the city, they found it burned with fire, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
4 Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept, until they had no more strength to weep.
5 David’s two wives also had been taken captive, Ahinʹo-am of Jezreʹel, and Abʹigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
6 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul, each for his sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in theLordhis God.
7 And David said to Abiʹathar the priest, the son of Ahimʹelech, “Bring me the ephod.” So Abiʹathar brought the ephod to David.
8 And David inquired of theLord, “Shall I pursue after this band? Shall I overtake them?” He answered him, “Pursue; for you shall surely overtake and shall surely rescue.”
9 So David set out, and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the brook Besor, where those stayed who were left behind.
10 But David went on with the pursuit, he and four hundred men; two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor.
11 They found an Egyptian in the open country, and brought him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, they gave him water to drink,
12 and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit revived; for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.
13 And David said to him, “To whom do you belong? And where are you from?” He said, “I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalʹekite; and my master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago.
14 We had made a raid upon the Negeb of the Cherʹethites and upon that which belongs to Judah and upon the Negeb of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.”
15 And David said to him, “Will you take me down to this band?” And he said, “Swear to me by God, that you will not kill me, or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this band.”
16 And when he had taken him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
17 And David smote them from twilight until the evening of the next day; and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who mounted camels and fled.
18 David recovered all that the Amalʹekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.
19 Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken; David brought back all.
20 David also captured all the flocks and herds; and the people drove those cattle before him, and said, “This is David’s spoil.”
21 Then David came to the two hundred men, who had been too exhausted to follow David, and who had been left at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him; and when David drew near to the people he saluted them.
22 Then all the wicked and base fellows among the men who had gone with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil which we have recovered, except that each man may lead away his wife and children, and depart.”
23 But David said, “You shall not do so, my brothers, with what theLordhas given us; he has preserved us and given into our hand the band that came against us.
24 Who would listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage; they shall share alike.”
25 And from that day forward he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
26 When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, “Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of theLord”;
27 it was for those in Bethel, in Ramoth of the Negeb, in Jattir,
28 in Aroʹer, in Siphmoth, in Eshtemoʹa,
29 in Racal, in the cities of the Jerahʹmeelites, in the cities of the Kenʹites,
30 in Hormah, in Borashʹan, in Aʹthach,
31 in Hebron, for all the places where David and his men had roamed.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 30 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Cumque venissent David et viri ejus in Siceleg die tertia, Amalecitæ impetum fecerant ex parte australi in Siceleg, et percusserant Siceleg, et succenderant eam igni.
2 Et captivas duxerant mulieres ex ea, a minimo usque ad magnum: et non interfecerant quemquam, sed secum duxerant, et pergebant itinere suo.
3 Cum ergo venissent David et viri ejus ad civitatem, et invenissent eam succensam igni, et uxores suas, et filios suos et filias, ductas esse captivas,
4 levaverunt David et populus qui erat cum eo voces suas, et planxerunt donec deficerent in eis lacrimæ.
5 Siquidem et duæ uxores David captivæ ductæ fuerant, Achinoam Jezrahelites, et Abigail uxor Nabal Carmeli.
6 Et contristatus est David valde: volebat enim eum populus lapidare, quia amara erat anima uniuscujusque viri super filiis suis et filiabus: confortatus est autem David in Domino Deo suo.
7 Et ait ad Abiathar sacerdotem filium Achimelech: Applica ad me ephod. Et applicavit Abiathar ephod ad David.
8 Et consuluit David Dominum, dicens: Persequar latrunculos hos, et comprehendam eos, an non? Dixitque ei Dominus: Persequere: absque dubio enim comprehendes eos, et excuties prædam.

9 Abiit ergo David, ipse et sexcenti viri qui erant cum eo, et venerunt usque ad torrentem Besor: et lassi quidam substiterunt.
10 Persecutus est autem David ipse, et quadringenti viri: substiterant enim ducenti, qui lassi transire non poterant torrentem Besor.
11 Et invenerunt virum ægyptium in agro, et adduxerunt eum ad David: dederuntque ei panem ut comederet, et biberet aquam,
12 sed et fragmen massæ caricarum, et duas ligaturas uvæ passæ. Quæ cum comedisset, reversus est spiritus ejus, et refocillatus est: non enim comederat panem, neque biberat aquam, tribus diebus et tribus noctibus.
13 Dixit itaque ei David: Cujus es tu? vel unde? et quo pergis? Qui ait: Puer ægyptius ego sum, servus viri Amalecitæ: dereliquit autem me dominus meus, quia ægrotare cœpi nudiustertius.
14 Siquidem nos erupimus ad australem plagam Cerethi, et contra Judam, et ad meridiem Caleb, et Siceleg succendimus igni.
15 Dixitque ei David: Potes me ducere ad cuneum istum? Qui ait: Jura mihi per Deum quod non occidas me, et non tradas me in manus domini mei, et ego ducam te ad cuneum istum. Et juravit ei David.
16 Qui cum duxisset eum, ecce illi discumbebant super faciem universæ terræ comedentes et bibentes, et quasi festum celebrantes diem, pro cuncta præda et spoliis quæ ceperant de terra Philisthiim et de terra Juda.
17 Et percussit eos David a vespere usque ad vesperam alterius diei, et non evasit ex eis quisquam, nisi quadringenti viri adolescentes, qui ascenderant camelos et fugerant.

18 Eruit ergo David omnia quæ tulerant Amalecitæ, et duas uxores suas eruit.
19 Nec defuit quidquam a parvo usque ad magnum, tam de filiis quam de filiabus, et de spoliis, et quæcumque rapuerant: omnia reduxit David.
20 Et tulit universos greges et armenta, et minavit ante faciem suam: dixeruntque: Hæc est præda David.
21 Venit autem David ad ducentos viros qui lassi substiterant, nec sequi potuerant David, et residere eos jusserat in torrente Besor: qui egressi sunt obviam David et populo qui erat cum eo. Accedens autem David ad populum, salutavit eos pacifice.
22 Respondensque omnis vir pessimus et iniquus de viris qui ierant cum David, dixit: Quia non venerunt nobiscum, non dabimus eis quidquam de præda quam eruimus: sed sufficiat unicuique uxor sua et filii: quos cum acceperint, recedant.
23 Dixit autem David: Non sic facietis, fratres mei, de his quæ tradidit nobis Dominus, et custodivit nos, et dedit latrunculos qui eruperant adversum nos, in manus nostras:
24 nec audiet vos quisquam super sermone hoc: æqua enim pars erit descendentis ad prælium, et remanentis ad sarcinas, et similiter divident.
25 Et factum est hoc ex die illa et deinceps, constitutum et præfinitum, et quasi lex in Israël usque in diem hanc.

26 Venit ergo David in Siceleg, et misit dona de præda senioribus Juda proximis suis, dicens: Accipite benedictionem de præda hostium Domini:
27 his qui erant in Bethel, et qui in Ramoth ad meridiem, et qui in Jether,
28 et qui in Aroër, et qui in Sephamoth, et qui in Esthamo,
29 et qui in Rachal, et qui in urbibus Jerameel, et qui in urbibus Ceni,
30 et qui in Arama, et qui in lacu Asan, et qui in Athach,
31 et qui in Hebron, et reliquis qui erant in his locis in quibus commoratus fuerat David, ipse et viri ejus.

1 καὶ ἐγενήθη εἰσελθόντος Δαυιδ καὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν αὐτοῦ εἰς Σεκελακ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ καὶ Αμαληκ ἐπέθετο ἐπὶ τὸν νότον καὶ ἐπὶ Σεκελακ καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὴν Σεκελακ καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί
2 καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου οὐκ ἐθανάτωσαν ἄνδρα καὶ γυναῖκα ἀλ{L'} ᾐχμαλώτευσαν καὶ ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῶν
3 καὶ ἦλθεν Δαυιδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐμπεπύρισται ἐν πυρί αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῶν ᾐχμαλωτευμένοι
4 καὶ ἦρεν Δαυιδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκλαυσαν ἕως ὅτου οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἰσχὺς ἔτι κλαίειν
5 καὶ ἀμφότεραι αἱ γυναῖκες Δαυιδ ᾐχμαλωτεύθησαν Αχινοομ ἡ Ιεζραηλῖτις καὶ Αβιγαια ἡ γυνὴ Ναβαλ τοῦ Καρμηλίου
6 καὶ ἐθλίβη Δαυιδ σφόδρα ὅτι εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς λιθοβολῆσαι αὐτόν ὅτι κατώδυνος ψυχὴ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ ἑκάστου ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκραταιώθη Δαυιδ ἐν κυρίῳ θεῷ αὐτοῦ
7 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Αβιαθαρ τὸν ἱερέα υἱὸν Αχιμελεχ προσάγαγε τὸ εφουδ
8 καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν Δαυιδ διὰ τοῦ κυρίου λέγων εἰ καταδιώξω ὀπίσω τοῦ γεδδουρ τούτου εἰ καταλήμψομαι αὐτούς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ καταδίωκε ὅτι καταλαμβάνων καταλήμψῃ καὶ ἐξαιρούμενος ἐξελῇ

9 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Δαυιδ αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔρχονται ἕως τοῦ χειμάρρου Βοσορ καὶ οἱ περισσοὶ ἔστησαν
10 καὶ κατεδίωξεν ἐν τετρακοσίοις ἀνδράσιν ὑπέστησαν δὲ διακόσιοι ἄνδρες οἵτινες ἐκάθισαν πέραν τοῦ χειμάρρου τοῦ Βοσορ
11 καὶ εὑρίσκουσιν ἄνδρα Αἰγύπτιον ἐν ἀγρῷ καὶ λαμβάνουσιν αὐτὸν καὶ ἄγουσιν αὐτὸν πρὸς Δαυιδ ἐν ἀγρῷ καὶ διδόασιν αὐτῷ ἄρτον καὶ ἔφαγεν καὶ ἐπότισαν αὐτὸν ὕδωρ
12 καὶ διδόασιν αὐτῷ κλάσμα παλάθης καὶ ἔφαγεν καὶ κατέστη τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ ὅτι οὐ βεβρώκει ἄρτον καὶ οὐ πεπώκει ὕδωρ τρεῖς ἡμέρας καὶ τρεῖς νύκτας
13 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δαυιδ τίνος σὺ εἶ καὶ πόθεν εἶ καὶ εἶπεν τὸ παιδάριον τὸ Αἰγύπτιον ἐγώ εἰμι δοῦλος ἀνδρὸς Αμαληκίτου καὶ κατέλιπέν με ὁ κύριός μου ὅτι ἠνωχλήθην ἐγὼ σήμερον τριταῖος
14 καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐπεθέμεθα ἐπὶ νότον τοῦ Χολθι καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τῆς Ιουδαίας μέρη καὶ ἐπὶ νότον Χελουβ καὶ τὴν Σεκελακ ἐνεπυρίσαμεν ἐν πυρί
15 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Δαυιδ εἰ κατάξεις με ἐπὶ τὸ γεδδουρ τοῦτο καὶ εἶπεν ὄμοσον δή μοι κατὰ τοῦ θεοῦ μὴ θανατώσειν με καὶ μὴ παραδοῦναί με εἰς χεῖρας τοῦ κυρίου μου καὶ κατάξω σε ἐπὶ τὸ γεδδουρ τοῦτο
16 καὶ κατήγαγεν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ καὶ ἰδοὺ οὗτοι διακεχυμένοι ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς ἐσθίοντες καὶ πίνοντες καὶ ἑορτάζοντες ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς σκύλοις τοῖς μεγάλοις οἷς ἔλαβον ἐκ γῆς ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐκ γῆς Ιουδα
17 καὶ ἦλθεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς Δαυιδ καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ ἑωσφόρου ἕως δείλης καὶ τῇ ἐπαύριον καὶ οὐκ ἐσώθη ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀνὴρ ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ τετρακόσια παιδάρια ἃ ἦν ἐπιβεβηκότα ἐπὶ τὰς καμήλους καὶ ἔφυγον

18 καὶ ἀφείλατο Δαυιδ πάντα ἃ ἔλαβον οἱ Αμαληκῖται καὶ ἀμφοτέρας τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτοῦ ἐξείλατο
19 καὶ οὐ διεφώνησεν αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν σκύλων καὶ ἕως υἱῶν καὶ θυγατέρων καὶ ἕως πάντων ὧν ἔλαβον αὐτῶν τὰ πάντα ἐπέστρεψεν Δαυιδ
20 καὶ ἔλαβεν Δαυιδ πάντα τὰ ποίμνια καὶ τὰ βουκόλια καὶ ἀπήγαγεν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν σκύλων καὶ τοῖς σκύλοις ἐκείνοις ἐλέγετο ταῦτα τὰ σκῦλα Δαυιδ
21 καὶ παραγίνεται Δαυιδ πρὸς τοὺς διακοσίους ἄνδρας τοὺς ἐκλυθέντας τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω Δαυιδ καὶ ἐκάθισεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ τῷ Βοσορ καὶ ἐξῆλθον εἰς ἀπάντησιν Δαυιδ καὶ εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ προσήγαγεν Δαυιδ ἕως τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ἠρώτησαν αὐτὸν τὰ εἰς εἰρήνην
22 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη πᾶς ἀνὴρ λοιμὸς καὶ πονηρὸς τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν πολεμιστῶν τῶν πορευθέντων μετὰ Δαυιδ καὶ εἶπαν ὅτι οὐ κατεδίωξαν με{Q'} ἡμῶν οὐ δώσομεν αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῶν σκύλων ὧν ἐξειλάμεθα ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ ἕκαστος τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ ἀπαγέσθωσαν καὶ ἀποστρεφέτωσαν
23 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ οὐ ποιήσετε οὕτως μετὰ τὸ παραδοῦναι τὸν κύριον ἡμῖν καὶ φυλάξαι ἡμᾶς καὶ παρέδωκεν κύριος τὸν γεδδουρ τὸν ἐπερχόμενον ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς εἰς χεῖρας ἡμῶν
24 καὶ τίς ὑπακούσεται ὑμῶν τῶν λόγων τούτων ὅτι οὐχ ἧττον ὑμῶν εἰσιν διότι κατὰ τὴν μερίδα τοῦ καταβαίνοντος εἰς πόλεμον οὕτως ἔσται ἡ μερὶς τοῦ καθημένου ἐπὶ τὰ σκεύη κατὰ τὸ αὐτὸ μεριοῦνται
25 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης καὶ ἐπάνω καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς πρόσταγμα καὶ εἰς δικαίωμα τῷ Ισραηλ ἕως τῆς σήμερον
