# First Book of Samuel 4 (RSVCE)

### The Ark of God Captured
1 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines; they encamped at Ebeneʹzer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.
2 The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who slew about four thousand men on the field of battle.
3 And when the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has theLordput us to rout today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of theLordhere from Shiloh, that he may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.”
4 So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought from there the ark of the covenant of theLordof hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinʹehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
5 When the ark of the covenant of theLordcame into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.
6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” And when they learned that the ark of theLordhad come to the camp,
7 the Philistines were afraid; for they said, “A god has come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.
8 Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.
9 Take courage, and acquit yourselves like men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; acquit yourselves like men and fight.”
10 So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled, every man to his home; and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.
11 And the ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinʹehas, were slain.
### Death of Eli
12 A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head.
13 When he arrived, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out.
14 When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, “What is this uproar?” Then the man hastened and came and told Eli.
15 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.
16 And the man said to Eli, “I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today.” And he said, “How did it go, my son?”
17 He who brought the tidings answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great slaughter among the people; your two sons also, Hophni and Phinʹehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”
18 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
19 Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinʹehas, was with child, about to give birth. And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth; for her pains came upon her.
20 And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her, “Fear not, for you have borne a son.” But she did not answer or give heed.
21 And she named the child Ichʹabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel!” because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
22 And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et factum est in diebus illis, convenerunt Philisthiim in pugnam: et egressus est Israël obviam Philisthiim in prælium, et castrametatus est juxta lapidem Adjutorii. Porro Philisthiim venerunt in Aphec,
2 et instruxerunt aciem contra Israël. Inito autem certamine, terga vertit Israël Philisthæis: et cæsa sunt in illo certamine passim per agros, quasi quatuor millia virorum.
3 Et reversus est populus ad castra: dixeruntque majores natu de Israël: Quare percussit nos Dominus hodie coram Philisthiim? afferamus ad nos de Silo arcam fœderis Domini, et veniat in medium nostri, ut salvet nos de manu inimicorum nostrorum.

4 Misit ergo populus in Silo, et tulerunt inde arcam fœderis Domini exercituum sedentis super cherubim: erantque duo filii Heli cum arca fœderis Dei, Ophni et Phinees.
5 Cumque venisset arca fœderis Domini in castra, vociferatus est omnis Israël clamore grandi, et personuit terra.
6 Et audierunt Philisthiim vocem clamoris, dixeruntque: Quænam est hæc vox clamoris magni in castris Hebræorum? Et cognoverunt quod arca Domini venisset in castra.
7 Timueruntque Philisthiim, dicentes: Venit Deus in castra. Et ingemuerunt, dicentes:
8 Væ nobis: non enim fuit tanta exultatio heri et nudiustertius: væ nobis. Quis nos salvabit de manu deorum sublimium istorum? hi sunt dii, qui percusserunt Ægyptum omni plaga in deserto.
9 Confortamini, et estote viri, Philisthiim, ne serviatis Hebræis, sicut et illi servierunt vobis: confortamini, et bellate.
10 Pugnaverunt ergo Philisthiim, et cæsus est Israël, et fugit unusquisque in tabernaculum suum: et facta est plaga magna nimis, et ceciderunt de Israël triginta millia peditum.
11 Et arca Dei capta est: duo quoque filii Heli mortui sunt, Ophni et Phinees.

12 Currens autem vir de Benjamin ex acie, venit in Silo in die illa, scissa veste, et conspersus pulvere caput.
13 Cumque ille venisset, Heli sedebat super sellam contra viam spectans. Erat enim cor ejus pavens pro arca Dei. Vir autem ille postquam ingressus est, nuntiavit urbi: et ululavit omnis civitas.
14 Et audivit Heli sonitum clamoris, dixitque: Quis est hic sonitus tumultus hujus? At ille festinavit, et venit, et nuntiavit Heli.
15 Heli autem erat nonaginta et octo annorum, et oculi ejus caligaverant, et videre non poterat.
16 Et dixit ad Heli: Ego sum qui veni de prælio, et ego qui de acie fugi hodie. Cui ille ait: Quid actum est, fili mi?
17 Respondens autem ille qui nuntiabat: Fugit, inquit, Israël coram Philisthiim, et ruina magna facta est in populo: insuper et duo filii tui mortui sunt, Ophni et Phinees, et arca Dei capta est.
18 Cumque ille nominasset arcam Dei, cecidit de sella retrorsum juxta ostium, et fractis cervicibus mortuus est. Senex enim erat vir et grandævus: et ipse judicavit Israël quadraginta annis.

19 Nurus autem ejus, uxor Phinees, prægnans erat, vicinaque partui: et audito nuntio quod capta esset arca Dei, et mortuus esset socer suus et vir suus, incurvavit se et peperit: irruerant enim in eam dolores subiti.
20 In ipso autem momento mortis ejus, dixerunt ei quæ stabant circa eam: Ne timeas, quia filium peperisti. Quæ non respondit eis, neque animadvertit.
21 Et vocabit puerum Ichabod, dicens: Translata est gloria de Israël, quia capta est arca Dei, et pro socero suo et pro viro suo;
22 et ait: Translata est gloria ab Israël, eo quod capta esset arca Dei.

1 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις καὶ συναθροίζονται ἀλλόφυλοι εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ισραηλ εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῖς εἰς πόλεμον καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν ἐπὶ Αβενεζερ καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι παρεμβάλλουσιν ἐν Αφεκ
2 καὶ παρατάσσονται οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἔκλινεν ὁ πόλεμος καὶ ἔπταισεν ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ ἐνώπιον ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐπλήγησαν ἐν τῇ παρατάξει ἐν ἀγρῷ τέσσαρες χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν
3 καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν καὶ εἶπαν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ισραηλ κατὰ τί ἔπταισεν ἡμᾶς κύριος σήμερον ἐνώπιον ἀλλοφύλων λάβωμεν τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐκ Σηλωμ καὶ ἐξελθέτω ἐν μέσῳ ἡμῶν καὶ σώσει ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν

4 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς Σηλωμ καὶ αἴρουσιν ἐκεῖθεν τὴν κιβωτὸν κυρίου καθημένου χερουβιμ καὶ ἀμφότεροι οἱ υἱοὶ Ηλι μετὰ τῆς κιβωτοῦ Οφνι καὶ Φινεες
5 καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς ἦλθεν κιβωτὸς κυρίου εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν καὶ ἀνέκραξεν πᾶς Ισραηλ φωνῇ μεγάλῃ καὶ ἤχησεν ἡ γῆ
6 καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι τῆς κραυγῆς καὶ εἶπον οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι τίς ἡ κραυγὴ ἡ μεγάλη αὕτη ἐν παρεμβολῇ τῶν Εβραίων καὶ ἔγνωσαν ὅτι κιβωτὸς κυρίου ἥκει εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν
7 καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ εἶπον οὗτοι οἱ θεοὶ ἥκασιν πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν οὐαὶ ἡμῖν ἐξελοῦ ἡμᾶς κύριε σήμερον ὅτι οὐ γέγονεν τοιαύτη ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην
8 οὐαὶ ἡμῖν τίς ἐξελεῖται ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν θεῶν τῶν στερεῶν τούτων οὗτοι οἱ θεοὶ οἱ πατάξαντες τὴν Αἴγυπτον ἐν πάσῃ πληγῇ καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ
9 κραταιοῦσθε καὶ γίνεσθε εἰς ἄνδρας ἀλλόφυλοι μήποτε δουλεύσητε τοῖς Εβραίοις καθὼς ἐδούλευσαν ἡμῖν καὶ ἔσεσθε εἰς ἄνδρας καὶ πολεμήσατε αὐτούς
10 καὶ ἐπολέμησαν αὐτούς καὶ πταίει ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ καὶ ἔφυγεν ἕκαστος εἰς σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγένετο πληγὴ μεγάλη σφόδρα καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐξ Ισραηλ τριάκοντα χιλιάδες ταγμάτων
11 καὶ κιβωτὸς θεοῦ ἐλήμφθη καὶ ἀμφότεροι υἱοὶ Ηλι ἀπέθανον Οφνι καὶ Φινεες

12 καὶ ἔδραμεν ἀνὴρ Ιεμιναῖος ἐκ τῆς παρατάξεως καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Σηλωμ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ διερρηγότα καὶ γῆ ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ ἦλθεν καὶ ἰδοὺ Ηλι ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τοῦ δίφρου παρὰ τὴν πύλην σκοπεύων τὴν ὁδόν ὅτι ἦν ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ ἐξεστηκυῖα περὶ τῆς κιβωτοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἀπαγγεῖλαι καὶ ἀνεβόησεν ἡ πόλις
14 καὶ ἤκουσεν Ηλι τὴν φωνὴν τῆς βοῆς καὶ εἶπεν τίς ἡ βοὴ τῆς φωνῆς ταύτης καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος σπεύσας εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ Ηλι
15 καὶ Ηλι υἱὸς ἐνενήκοντα ἐτῶν καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπανέστησαν καὶ οὐκ ἔβλεπεν καὶ εἶπεν Ηλὶ τοῖς ἀνδράσιν τοῖς περιεστηκόσιν αὐτῷ τίς ἡ φωνὴ τοῦ ἤχους τούτου
16 καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ σπεύσας προσῆλθεν πρὸς Ηλι καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἥκων ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς κἀγὼ πέφευγα ἐκ τῆς παρατάξεως σήμερον καὶ εἶπεν τί τὸ γεγονὸς ῥῆμα τέκνον
17 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη τὸ παιδάριον καὶ εἶπεν πέφευγεν ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ ἐκ προσώπου ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐγένετο πληγὴ μεγάλη ἐν τῷ λαῷ καὶ ἀμφότεροι οἱ υἱοί σου τεθνήκασιν καὶ ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ θεοῦ ἐλήμφθη
18 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐμνήσθη τῆς κιβωτοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἔπεσεν ἀπὸ τοῦ δίφρου ὀπισθίως ἐχόμενος τῆς πύλης καὶ συνετρίβη ὁ νῶτος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέθανεν ὅτι πρεσβύτης ὁ ἄνθρωπος καὶ βαρύς καὶ αὐτὸς ἔκρινεν τὸν Ισραηλ εἴκοσι ἔτη

19 καὶ νύμφη αὐτοῦ γυνὴ Φινεες συνειληφυῖα τοῦ τεκεῖν καὶ ἤκουσεν τὴν ἀγγελίαν ὅτι ἐλήμφθη ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ πενθερὸς αὐτῆς καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς καὶ ὤκλασεν καὶ ἔτεκεν ὅτι ἐπεστράφησαν ἐ{P'} αὐτὴν ὠδῖνες αὐτῆς
20 καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ αὐτῆς ἀποθνῄσκει καὶ εἶπον αὐτῇ αἱ γυναῖκες αἱ παρεστηκυῖαι αὐτῇ μὴ φοβοῦ ὅτι υἱὸν τέτοκας καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη καὶ οὐκ ἐνόησεν ἡ καρδία αὐτῆς
21 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ παιδάριον Οὐαὶ βαρχαβωθ ὑπὲρ τῆς κιβωτοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ὑπὲρ τοῦ πενθεροῦ αὐτῆς καὶ ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς
22 καὶ εἶπαν ἀπῴκισται δόξα Ισραηλ ἐν τῷ λημφθῆναι τὴν κιβωτὸν κυρίου
