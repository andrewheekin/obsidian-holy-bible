# First Book of Samuel 19 (RSVCE)

### Jonathan Intercedes for David
1 And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted much in David.
2 And Jonathan told David, “Saul my father seeks to kill you; therefore take heed to yourself in the morning, stay in a secret place and hide yourself;
3 and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you; and if I learn anything I will tell you.”
4 And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Let not the king sin against his servant David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have been of good service to you;
5 for he took his life in his hand and he slew the Philistine, and theLordwrought a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced; why then will you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?”
6 And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan; Saul swore, “As theLordlives, he shall not be put to death.”
7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.
### Michal Helps David Escape from Saul
8 And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, and made a great slaughter among them, so that they fled before him.
9 Then an evil spirit from theLordcame upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing the lyre.
10 And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled, and escaped.
11 That night Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him, that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, told him, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”
12 So Michal let David down through the window; and he fled away and escaped.
13 Michal took an image and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head, and covered it with the clothes.
14 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”
15 Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.”
16 And when the messengers came in, behold, the image was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’ hair at its head.
17 Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go; why should I kill you?’ ”
### David Joins Samuel in Ramah
18 Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt at Naiʹoth.
19 And it was told Saul, “Behold, David is at Naiʹoth in Ramah.”
20 Then Saul sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
21 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
22 Then he himself went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu; and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” And one said, “Behold, they are at Naiʹoth in Ramah.”
23 And he went from there to Naiʹoth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied, until he came to Naiʹoth in Ramah.
24 And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Hence it is said, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 19 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Locutus est autem Saul ad Jonathan filium suum, et ad omnes servos suos, ut occiderent David. Porro Jonathas filius Saul diligebat David valde:
2 et indicavit Jonathas David, dicens: Quærit Saul pater meus occidere te: quapropter observa te, quæso, mane: et manebis clam, et absconderis.
3 Ego autem egrediens stabo juxta patrem meum in agro, ubicumque fueris: et ego loquar de te ad patrem meum, et quodcumque videro, nuntiabo tibi.
4 Locutus est ergo Jonathas de David bona ad Saul patrem suum: dixitque ad eum: Ne pecces rex in servum tuum David, quia non peccavit tibi, et opera ejus bona sunt tibi valde.
5 Et posuit animam suam in manu sua, et percussit Philisthæum, et fecit Dominus salutem magnam universo Israëli: vidisti, et lætatus es. Quare ergo peccas in sanguine innoxio, interficiens David, qui est absque culpa?
6 Quod cum audisset Saul, placatus voce Jonathæ, juravit: Vivit Dominus, quia non occidetur.
7 Vocavit itaque Jonathas David, et indicavit ei omnia verba hæc: et introduxit Jonathas David ad Saul, et fuit ante eum sicut fuerat heri et nudiustertius.
8 Motum est autem rursum bellum: et egressus David, pugnavit adversum Philisthiim: percussitque eos plaga magna, et fugerunt a facie ejus.

9 Et factus est spiritus Domini malus in Saul: sedebat autem in domo sua, et tenebat lanceam: porro David psallebat manu sua.
10 Nisusque est Saul configere David lancea in pariete, et declinavit David a facie Saul: lancea autem casso vulnere perlata est in parietem, et David fugit, et salvatus est nocte illa.
11 Misit ergo Saul satellites suos in domum David, ut custodirent eum, et interficeretur mane. Quod cum annuntiasset David Michol uxor sua, dicens: Nisi salvaveris te nocte hac, cras morieris:
12 deposuit eum per fenestram. Porro ille abiit et aufugit, atque salvatus est.
13 Tulit autem Michol statuam, et posuit eam super lectum, et pellem pilosam caprarum posuit ad caput ejus, et operuit eam vestimentis.
14 Misit autem Saul apparitores, qui raperent David: et responsum est quod ægrotaret.
15 Rursumque misit Saul nuntios ut viderent David, dicens: Afferte eum ad me in lecto, ut occidatur.
16 Cumque venissent nuntii, inventum est simulacrum super lectum, et pellis caprarum ad caput ejus.
17 Dixitque Saul ad Michol: Quare sic illusisti mihi, et dimisisti inimicum meum ut fugeret? Et respondit Michol ad Saul: Quia ipse locutus est mihi: Dimitte me, alioquin interficiam te.

18 David autem fugiens salvatus est, et venit ad Samuel in Ramatha, et nuntiavit ei omnia quæ fecerat sibi Saul: et abierunt ipse et Samuel, et morati sunt in Najoth.
19 Nuntiatum est autem Sauli a dicentibus: Ecce David in Najoth in Ramatha.
20 Misit ergo Saul lictores, ut raperent David: qui cum vidissent cuneum prophetarum vaticinantium, et Samuelem stantem super eos, factus est etiam spiritus Domini in illis, et prophetare cœperunt etiam ipsi.
21 Quod cum nuntiatum esset Sauli, misit et alios nuntios: prophetaverunt autem et illi. Et rursum misit Saul tertios nuntios: qui et ipsi prophetaverunt. Et iratus iracundia Saul,
22 abiit etiam ipse in Ramatha, et venit usque ad cisternam magnam quæ est in Socho, et interrogavit, et dixit: In quo loco sunt Samuel et David? Dictumque est ei: Ecce in Najoth sunt in Ramatha.
23 Et abiit in Najoth in Ramatha, et factus est etiam super eum spiritus Domini, et ambulabat ingrediens, et prophetabat usque dum veniret in Najoth in Ramatha.
24 Et expoliavit etiam ipse se vestimentis suis, et prophetavit cum ceteris coram Samuele, et cecidit nudus tota die illa et nocte. Unde et exivit proverbium: Num et Saul inter prophetas?


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 19 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐλάλησεν Σαουλ πρὸς Ιωναθαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ πρὸς πάντας τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ θανατῶσαι τὸν Δαυιδ καὶ Ιωναθαν υἱὸς Σαουλ ᾑρεῖτο τὸν Δαυιδ σφόδρα
2 καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν Ιωναθαν τῷ Δαυιδ λέγων Σαουλ ζητεῖ θανατῶσαί σε φύλαξαι οὖν αὔριον πρωὶ καὶ κρύβηθι καὶ κάθισον κρυβῇ
3 καὶ ἐγὼ ἐξελεύσομαι καὶ στήσομαι ἐχόμενος τοῦ πατρός μου ἐν ἀγρῷ οὗ ἐὰν ᾖς ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐγὼ λαλήσω περὶ σοῦ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα μου καὶ ὄψομαι ὅ τι ἐὰν ᾖ καὶ ἀπαγγελῶ σοι
4 καὶ ἐλάλησεν Ιωναθαν περὶ Δαυιδ ἀγαθὰ πρὸς Σαουλ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν μὴ ἁμαρτησάτω ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὸν δοῦλόν σου Δαυιδ ὅτι οὐχ ἡμάρτηκεν εἰς σέ καὶ τὰ ποιήματα αὐτοῦ ἀγαθὰ σφόδρα
5 καὶ ἔθετο τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὸν ἀλλόφυλον καὶ ἐποίησεν κύριος σωτηρίαν μεγάλην καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ εἶδον καὶ ἐχάρησαν καὶ ἵνα τί ἁμαρτάνεις εἰς αἷμα ἀθῷον θανατῶσαι τὸν Δαυιδ δωρεάν
6 καὶ ἤκουσεν Σαουλ τῆς φωνῆς Ιωναθαν καὶ ὤμοσεν Σαουλ λέγων ζῇ κύριος εἰ ἀποθανεῖται
7 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ιωναθαν τὸν Δαυιδ καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα καὶ εἰσήγαγεν Ιωναθαν τὸν Δαυιδ πρὸς Σαουλ καὶ ἦν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν
8 καὶ προσέθετο ὁ πόλεμος γενέσθαι πρὸς Σαουλ καὶ κατίσχυσεν Δαυιδ καὶ ἐπολέμησεν τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτοῖς πληγὴν μεγάλην σφόδρα καὶ ἔφυγον ἐκ προσώπου αὐτοῦ

9 καὶ ἐγένετο πνεῦμα θεοῦ πονηρὸν ἐπὶ Σαουλ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν οἴκῳ καθεύδων καὶ δόρυ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ Δαυιδ ἔψαλλεν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ
10 καὶ ἐζήτει Σαουλ πατάξαι τὸ δόρυ εἰς Δαυιδ καὶ ἀπέστη Δαυιδ ἐκ προσώπου Σαουλ καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὸ δόρυ εἰς τὸν τοῖχον καὶ Δαυιδ ἀνεχώρησεν καὶ διεσώθη
11 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σαουλ ἀγγέλους εἰς οἶκον Δαυιδ φυλάξαι αὐτὸν τοῦ θανατῶσαι αὐτὸν πρωί καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ Δαυιδ Μελχολ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ λέγουσα ἐὰν μὴ σὺ σώσῃς τὴν ψυχὴν σαυτοῦ τὴν νύκτα ταύτην αὔριον θανατωθήσῃ
12 καὶ κατάγει ἡ Μελχολ τὸν Δαυιδ διὰ τῆς θυρίδος καὶ ἀπῆλθεν καὶ ἔφυγεν καὶ σῴζεται
13 καὶ ἔλαβεν ἡ Μελχολ τὰ κενοτάφια καὶ ἔθετο ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην καὶ ἧπαρ τῶν αἰγῶν ἔθετο πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκάλυψεν αὐτὰ ἱματίῳ
14 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σαουλ ἀγγέλους λαβεῖν τὸν Δαυιδ καὶ λέγουσιν ἐνοχλεῖσθαι αὐτόν
15 καὶ ἀποστέλλει ἐπὶ τὸν Δαυιδ λέγων ἀγάγετε αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης πρός με τοῦ θανατῶσαι αὐτόν
16 καὶ ἔρχονται οἱ ἄγγελοι καὶ ἰδοὺ τὰ κενοτάφια ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης καὶ ἧπαρ τῶν αἰγῶν πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ τῇ Μελχολ ἵνα τί οὕτως παρελογίσω με καὶ ἐξαπέστειλας τὸν ἐχθρόν μου καὶ διεσώθη καὶ εἶπεν Μελχολ τῷ Σαουλ αὐτὸς εἶπεν ἐξαπόστειλόν με εἰ δὲ μή θανατώσω σε

18 καὶ Δαυιδ ἔφυγεν καὶ διεσώθη καὶ παραγίνεται πρὸς Σαμουηλ εἰς Αρμαθαιμ καὶ ἀπαγγέλλει αὐτῷ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ Σαουλ καὶ ἐπορεύθη Δαυιδ καὶ Σαμουηλ καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐν Ναυαθ ἐν Ραμα
19 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαουλ λέγοντες ἰδοὺ Δαυιδ ἐν Ναυαθ ἐν Ραμα
20 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σαουλ ἀγγέλους λαβεῖν τὸν Δαυιδ καὶ εἶδαν τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τῶν προφητῶν καὶ Σαμουηλ εἱστήκει καθεστηκὼς ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀγγέλους τοῦ Σαουλ πνεῦμα θεοῦ καὶ προφητεύουσιν
21 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαουλ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους ἑτέρους καὶ ἐπροφήτευσαν καὶ αὐτοί καὶ προσέθετο Σαουλ ἀποστεῖλαι ἀγγέλους τρίτους καὶ ἐπροφήτευσαν καὶ αὐτοί
22 καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ Σαουλ καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ αὐτὸς εἰς Αρμαθαιμ καὶ ἔρχεται ἕως τοῦ φρέατος τοῦ ἅλω τοῦ ἐν τῷ Σεφι καὶ ἠρώτησεν καὶ εἶπεν ποῦ Σαμουηλ καὶ Δαυιδ καὶ εἶπαν ἰδοὺ ἐν Ναυαθ ἐν Ραμα
23 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Ναυαθ ἐν Ραμα καὶ ἐγενήθη καὶ ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ πνεῦμα θεοῦ καὶ ἐπορεύετο προφητεύων ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν αὐτὸν εἰς Ναυαθ ἐν Ραμα
24 καὶ ἐξεδύσατο τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπροφήτευσεν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν καὶ ἔπεσεν γυμνὸς ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην καὶ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα διὰ τοῦτο ἔλεγον εἰ καὶ Σαουλ ἐν προφήταις
