# First Book of Samuel 14 (RSVCE)

### Jonathan Surprises and Routs the Philistines
1 One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on yonder side.” But he did not tell his father.
2 Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibʹe-ah under the pomegranate tree which is at Migron; the people who were with him were about six hundred men,
3 and Ahiʹjah the son of Ahiʹtub, Ichʹabod’s brother, son of Phinʹehas, son of Eli, the priest of theLordin Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.
4 In the pass, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side; the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
5 The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.
6 And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that theLordwill work for us; for nothing can hinder theLordfrom saving by many or by few.”
7 And his armor-bearer said to him, “Do all that your mind inclines to; behold, I am with you, as is your mind so is mine.”
8 Then said Jonathan, “Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them.
9 If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them.
10 But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up; for theLordhas given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us.”
11 So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, “Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hid themselves.”
12 And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.” And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me; for theLordhas given them into the hand of Israel.”
13 Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him;
14 and that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was of about twenty men within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.
15 And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and even the raiders trembled; the earth quaked; and it became a very great panic.
16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibʹe-ah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude was surging hither and thither.
17 Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Number and see who has gone from us.” And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.
18 And Saul said to Ahiʹjah, “Bring hither the ark of God.” For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel.
19 And while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more; and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”
20 Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle; and behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion.
21 Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
22 Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill country of Eʹphraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle.
23 So theLorddelivered Israel that day; and the battle passed beyond Beth-aʹven.
### Saul’s Rash Oath
24 And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul laid an oath on the people, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.
25 And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.
26 And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.
27 But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; so he put forth the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes became bright.
28 Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food this day.’ ” And the people were faint.
29 Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land; see how my eyes have become bright, because I tasted a little of this honey.
30 How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found; for now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great.”
31 They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aiʹjalon. And the people were very faint;
32 the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.
33 Then they told Saul, “Behold, the people are sinning against theLord, by eating with the blood.” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here.”
34 And Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, ‘Let every man bring his ox or his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and do not sin against theLordby eating with the blood.’ ” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
35 And Saul built an altar to theLord; it was the first altar that he built to theLord.
### Jonathan in Danger of Death
36 Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and despoil them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near hither to God.”
37 And Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him that day.
38 And Saul said, “Come hither, all you leaders of the people; and know and see how this sin has arisen today.
39 For as theLordlives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
40 Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”
41 Therefore Saul said, “OLordGod of Israel, why hast thou not answered thy servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, OLord, God of Israel, give Urim; but if this guilt is in thy people Israel, give Thummim.” And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.
42 Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was taken.
43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand; here I am, I will die.”
44 And Saul said, “God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan.”
45 Then the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As theLordlives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has wrought with God this day.” So the people ransomed Jonathan, that he did not die.
46 Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
### Saul’s Continuing Wars
47 When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; wherever he turned he put them to the worse.
48 And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalʹekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.
49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malʹchishuʹa; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal;
50 and the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinʹo-am the daughter of Ahimʹa-az. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle;
51 Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiʹel.
52 There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et accidit quadam die ut diceret Jonathas filius Saul ad adolescentem armigerum suum: Veni, et transeamus ad stationem Philisthinorum, quæ est trans locum illum. Patri autem suo hoc ipsum non indicavit.

2 Porro Saul morabatur in extrema parte Gabaa sub malogranato, quæ erat in Magron: et erat populus cum eo quasi sexcentorum virorum.
3 Et Achias filius Achitob fratris Ichabod filii Phinees, qui ortus fuerat ex Heli sacerdote Domini in Silo, portabat ephod. Sed et populus ignorabat quo isset Jonathas.
4 Erant autem inter ascensus per quos nitebatur Jonathas transire ad stationem Philisthinorum, eminentes petræ ex utraque parte, et quasi in modum dentium scopuli hinc et inde prærupti: nomen uni Boses, et nomen alteri Sene:
5 unus scopulus prominens ad aquilonem ex adverso Machmas, et alter ad meridiem contra Gabaa.
6 Dixit autem Jonathas ad adolescentem armigerum suum: Veni, transeamus ad stationem incircumcisorum horum, si forte faciat Dominus pro nobis: quia non est Domino difficile salvare, vel in multis, vel in paucis.
7 Dixitque ei armiger suus: Fac omnia quæ placent animo tuo: perge quo cupis, et ero tecum ubicumque volueris.

8 Et ait Jonathas: Ecce nos transimus ad viros istos. Cumque apparuerimus eis,
9 si taliter locuti fuerint ad nos: Manete donec veniamus ad vos: stemus in loco nostro, nec ascendamus ad eos.
10 Si autem dixerint: Ascendite ad nos: ascendamus, quia tradidit eos Dominus in manibus nostris: hoc erit nobis signum.
11 Apparuit igitur uterque stationi Philisthinorum: dixeruntque Philisthiim: En Hebræi egrediuntur de cavernis in quibus absconditi fuerant.
12 Et locuti sunt viri de statione ad Jonathan et ad armigerum ejus, dixeruntque: Ascendite ad nos, et ostendemus vobis rem. Et ait Jonathas ad armigerum suum: Ascendamus: sequere me: tradidit enim Dominus eos in manus Israël.
13 Ascendit autem Jonathas manibus et pedibus reptans, et armiger ejus post eum. Itaque alii cadebant ante Jonathan, alios armiger ejus interficiebat sequens eum.
14 Et facta est plaga prima qua percussit Jonathas et armiger ejus, quasi viginti virorum in media parte jugeri quam par boum in die arare consuevit.
15 Et factum est miraculum in castris per agros: sed et omnis populus stationis eorum qui ierant ad prædandum, obstupuit, et conturbata est terra: et accidit quasi miraculum a Deo.

16 Et respexerunt speculatores Saul qui erant in Gabaa Benjamin, et ecce multitudo prostrata, et huc illucque diffugiens.
17 Et ait Saul populo qui erat cum eo: Requirite, et videte quis abierit ex nobis. Cumque requisissent, repertum est non adesse Jonathan et armigerum ejus.
18 Et ait Saul ad Achiam: Applica arcam Dei. (Erat enim ibi arca Dei in die illa cum filiis Israël.)
19 Cumque loqueretur Saul ad sacerdotem, tumultus magnus exortus est in castris Philisthinorum: crescebatque paulatim, et clarius resonabat. Et ait Saul ad sacerdotem: Contrahe manum tuam.
20 Conclamavit ergo Saul, et omnis populus qui erat cum eo, et venerunt usque ad locum certaminis: et ecce versus fuerat gladius uniuscujusque ad proximum suum, et cædes magna nimis.
21 Sed et Hebræi qui fuerant cum Philisthiim heri et nudiustertius, ascenderantque cum eis in castris, reversi sunt ut essent cum Israël qui erant cum Saul et Jonatha.
22 Omnes quoque Israëlitæ qui se absconderant in monte Ephraim, audientes quod fugissent Philisthæi, sociaverunt se cum suis in prælio. Et erant cum Saul quasi decem millia virorum.
23 Et salvavit Dominus in die illa Israël: pugna autem pervenit usque ad Bethaven.

24 Et viri Israël sociati sunt sibi in die illa: adjuravit autem Saul populum, dicens: Maledictus vir qui comederit panem usque ad vesperam, donec ulciscar de inimicis meis. Et non manducavit universus populus panem:
25 omneque terræ vulgus venit in saltum, in quo erat mel super faciem agri.
26 Ingressus est itaque populus saltum, et apparuit fluens mel, nullusque applicuit manum ad os suum: timebat enim populus juramentum.
27 Porro Jonathas non audierat cum adjuraret pater ejus populum: extenditque summitatem virgæ quam habebat in manu, et intinxit in favum mellis: et convertit manum suam ad os suum, et illuminati sunt oculi ejus.
28 Respondensque unus de populo, ait: Jurejurando constrinxit pater tuus populum, dicens: Maledictus vir qui comederit panem hodie. (Defecerat autem populus.)
29 Dixitque Jonathas: Turbavit pater meus terram: vidistis ipsi quia illuminati sunt oculi mei, eo quod gustaverim paululum de melle isto:
30 quanto magis si comedisset populus de præda inimicorum suorum, quam reperit? nonne major plaga facta fuisset in Philisthiim?

31 Percusserunt ergo in die illa Philisthæos a Machmis usque in Ajalon.Defatigatus est autem populus nimis:
32 et versus ad prædam tulit oves, et boves, et vitulos, et mactaverunt in terra: comeditque populus cum sanguine.
33 Nuntiaverunt autem Sauli dicentes quod populus peccasset Domino, comedens cum sanguine. Qui ait: Prævaricati estis: volvite ad me jam nunc saxum grande.
34 Et dixit Saul: Dispergimini in vulgus, et dicite eis ut adducat ad me unusquisque bovem suum et arietem, et occidite super istud, et vescimini, et non peccabitis Domino comedentes cum sanguine. Adduxit itaque omnis populus unusquisque bovem in manu sua usque ad noctem: et occiderunt ibi.
35 Ædificavit autem Saul altare Domino, tuncque primum cœpit ædificare altare Domino.

36 Et dixit Saul: Irruamus super Philisthæos nocte, et vastemus eos usque dum illucescat mane, nec relinquamus ex eis virum. Dixitque populus: Omne quod bonum videtur in oculis tuis, fac. Et ait sacerdos: Accedamus huc ad Deum.
37 Et consuluit Saul Dominum: Num persequar Philisthiim? si trades eos in manus Israël? Et non respondit ei in die illa.
38 Dixitque Saul: Applicate huc universos angulos populi: et scitote, et videte per quem acciderit peccatum hoc hodie.
39 Vivit Dominus salvator Israël, quia si per Jonathan filium meum factum est, absque retractione morietur. Ad quod nullus contradixit ei de omni populo.
40 Et ait ad universum Israël: Separamini vos in partem unam, et ego cum Jonatha filio meo ero in parte altera. Responditque populus ad Saul: Quod bonum videtur in oculis tuis, fac.
41 Et dixit Saul ad Dominum Deum Israël: Domine Deus Israël, da indicium: quid est quod non responderis servo tuo hodie? si in me, aut in Jonatha filio meo, est iniquitas hæc, da ostensionem: aut si hæc iniquitas est in populo tuo, da sanctitatem. Et deprehensus est Jonathas et Saul: populus autem exivit.
42 Et ait Saul: Mittite sortem inter me et inter Jonathan filium meum. Et captus est Jonathas.

43 Dixit autem Saul ad Jonathan: Indica mihi quid feceris. Et indicavit ei Jonathas, et ait: Gustans gustavi in summitate virgæ quæ erat in manu mea, paululum mellis, et ecce ego morior.
44 Et ait Saul: Hæc faciat mihi Deus, et hæc addat, quia morte morieris, Jonatha.
45 Dixitque populus ad Saul: Ergone Jonathas morietur, qui fecit salutem hanc magnam in Israël? hoc nefas est: vivit Dominus, si ceciderit capillus de capite ejus in terram, quia cum Deo operatus est hodie. Liberavit ergo populus Jonathan, ut non moreretur.
46 Recessitque Saul, nec persecutus est Philisthiim: porro Philisthiim abierunt in loca sua.

47 Et Saul, confirmato regno super Israël, pugnabat per circuitum adversum omnes inimicos ejus, contra Moab, et filios Ammon, et Edom, et reges Soba, et Philisthæos: et quocumque se verterat, superabat.
48 Congregatoque exercitu, percussit Amalec, et eruit Israël de manu vastatorum ejus.
49 Fuerunt autem filii Saul, Jonathas, et Jessui, et Melchisua: et nomina duarum filiarum ejus, nomen primogenitæ Merob, et nomen minoris Michol.
50 Et nomen uxoris Saul Achinoam filia Achimaas: et nomen principis militiæ ejus Abner filius Ner, patruelis Saul.
51 Porro Cis fuit pater Saul, et Ner pater Abner, filius Abiel.
52 Erat autem bellum potens adversum Philisthæos omnibus diebus Saul. Nam quemcumque viderat Saul virum fortem, et aptum ad prælium, sociabat eum sibi.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 14 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ γίνεται ἡμέρα καὶ εἶπεν Ιωναθαν υἱὸς Σαουλ τῷ παιδαρίῳ τῷ αἴροντι τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ δεῦρο καὶ διαβῶμεν εἰς μεσσαβ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τὴν ἐν τῷ πέραν ἐκείνῳ καὶ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν

2 καὶ Σαουλ ἐκάθητο ἐ{P'} ἄκρου τοῦ βουνοῦ ὑπὸ τὴν ῥόαν τὴν ἐν Μαγδων καὶ ἦσαν με{T'} αὐτοῦ ὡς ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες
3 καὶ Αχια υἱὸς Αχιτωβ ἀδελφοῦ Ιωχαβηδ υἱοῦ Φινεες υἱοῦ Ηλι ἱερεὺς τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν Σηλωμ αἴρων εφουδ καὶ ὁ λαὸς οὐκ ᾔδει ὅτι πεπόρευται Ιωναθαν
4 καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῆς διαβάσεως οὗ ἐζήτει Ιωναθαν διαβῆναι εἰς τὴν ὑπόστασιν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἀκρωτήριον πέτρας ἔνθεν καὶ ἀκρωτήριον πέτρας ἔνθεν ὄνομα τῷ ἑνὶ Βαζες καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ἄλλῳ Σεννα
5 ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ μία ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἐρχομένῳ Μαχμας καὶ ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἄλλη ἀπὸ νότου ἐρχομένῳ Γαβεε
6 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωναθαν πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον τὸ αἶρον τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ δεῦρο διαβῶμεν εἰς μεσσαβ τῶν ἀπεριτμήτων τούτων εἴ τι ποιήσαι ἡμῖν κύριος ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν τῷ κυρίῳ συνεχόμενον σῴζειν ἐν πολλοῖς ἢ ἐν ὀλίγοις
7 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ποίει πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν ἡ καρδία σου ἐκκλίνῃ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ μετὰ σοῦ ὡς ἡ καρδία σοῦ καρδία μοῦ

8 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωναθαν ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς διαβαίνομεν πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας καὶ κατακυλισθησόμεθα πρὸς αὐτούς
9 ἐὰν τάδε εἴπωσιν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀπόστητε ἐκεῖ ἕως ἂν ἀπαγγείλωμεν ὑμῖν καὶ στησόμεθα ἐ{F'} ἑαυτοῖς καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀναβῶμεν ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
10 καὶ ἐὰν τάδε εἴπωσιν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀνάβητε πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ ἀναβησόμεθα ὅτι παραδέδωκεν αὐτοὺς κύριος εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ἡμῶν τοῦτο ἡμῖν τὸ σημεῖον
11 καὶ εἰσῆλθον ἀμφότεροι εἰς μεσσαβ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ λέγουσιν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἰδοὺ οἱ Εβραῖοι ἐκπορεύονται ἐκ τῶν τρωγλῶν αὐτῶν οὗ ἐκρύβησαν ἐκεῖ
12 καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ ἄνδρες μεσσαβ πρὸς Ιωναθαν καὶ πρὸς τὸν αἴροντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ καὶ λέγουσιν ἀνάβητε πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ γνωριοῦμεν ὑμῖν ῥῆμα καὶ εἶπεν Ιωναθαν πρὸς τὸν αἴροντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἀνάβηθι ὀπίσω μου ὅτι παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς κύριος εἰς χεῖρας Ισραηλ
13 καὶ ἀνέβη Ιωναθαν ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέβλεψαν κατὰ πρόσωπον Ιωναθαν καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτούς καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἐπεδίδου ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἡ πληγὴ ἡ πρώτη ἣν ἐπάταξεν Ιωναθαν καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ὡς εἴκοσι ἄνδρες ἐν βολίσι καὶ ἐν πετροβόλοις καὶ ἐν κόχλαξιν τοῦ πεδίου
15 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἔκστασις ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ καὶ ἐν ἀγρῷ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς οἱ ἐν μεσσαβ καὶ οἱ διαφθείροντες ἐξέστησαν καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐκ ἤθελον ποιεῖν καὶ ἐθάμβησεν ἡ γῆ καὶ ἐγενήθη ἔκστασις παρὰ κυρίου

16 καὶ εἶδον οἱ σκοποὶ τοῦ Σαουλ ἐν Γαβεε Βενιαμιν καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ παρεμβολὴ τεταραγμένη ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν
17 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ τῷ λαῷ τῷ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐπισκέψασθε δὴ καὶ ἴδετε τίς πεπόρευται ἐξ ὑμῶν καὶ ἐπεσκέψαντο καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐχ εὑρίσκετο Ιωναθαν καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ
18 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ τῷ Αχια προσάγαγε τὸ εφουδ ὅτι αὐτὸς ἦρεν τὸ εφουδ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐνώπιον Ισραηλ
19 καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς ἐλάλει Σαουλ πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα καὶ ὁ ἦχος ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἐπορεύετο πορευόμενος καὶ ἐπλήθυνεν καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα συνάγαγε τὰς χεῖράς σου
20 καὶ ἀνεβόησεν Σαουλ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔρχονται ἕως τοῦ πολέμου καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγένετο ῥομφαία ἀνδρὸς ἐπὶ τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ σύγχυσις μεγάλη σφόδρα
21 καὶ οἱ δοῦλοι οἱ ὄντες ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν μετὰ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων οἱ ἀναβάντες εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν ἐπεστράφησαν καὶ αὐτοὶ εἶναι μετὰ Ισραηλ τῶν μετὰ Σαουλ καὶ Ιωναθαν
22 καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ οἱ κρυπτόμενοι ἐν τῷ ὄρει Εφραιμ καὶ ἤκουσαν ὅτι πεφεύγασιν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ συνάπτουσιν καὶ αὐτοὶ ὀπίσω αὐτῶν εἰς πόλεμον
23 καὶ ἔσωσεν κύριος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τὸν Ισραηλ καὶ ὁ πόλεμος διῆλθεν τὴν Βαιθων καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἦν μετὰ Σαουλ ὡς δέκα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν καὶ ἦν ὁ πόλεμος διεσπαρμένος εἰς ὅλην τὴν πόλιν ἐν τῷ ὄρει Εφραιμ

24 καὶ Σαουλ ἠγνόησεν ἄγνοιαν μεγάλην ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ ἀρᾶται τῷ λαῷ λέγων ἐπικατάρατος ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃς φάγεται ἄρτον ἕως ἑσπέρας καὶ ἐκδικήσω τὸν ἐχθρόν μου καὶ οὐκ ἐγεύσατο πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἄρτου
25 καὶ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ ἠρίστα καὶ ιααρ δρυμὸς ἦν μελισσῶνος κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἀγροῦ
26 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς τὸν μελισσῶνα καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐπορεύετο λαλῶν καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἦν ἐπιστρέφων τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐφοβήθη ὁ λαὸς τὸν ὅρκον κυρίου
27 καὶ Ιωναθαν οὐκ ἀκηκόει ἐν τῷ ὁρκίζειν τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ τὸν λαόν καὶ ἐξέτεινεν τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ σκήπτρου αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔβαψεν αὐτὸ εἰς τὸ κηρίον τοῦ μέλιτος καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέβλεψαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ
28 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη εἷς ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ὁρκίσας ὥρκισεν ὁ πατήρ σου τὸν λαὸν λέγων ἐπικατάρατος ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃς φάγεται ἄρτον σήμερον καὶ ἐξελύθη ὁ λαός
29 καὶ ἔγνω Ιωναθαν καὶ εἶπεν ἀπήλλαχεν ὁ πατήρ μου τὴν γῆν ἰδὲ δὴ ὅτι εἶδον οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου ὅτι ἐγευσάμην βραχὺ τοῦ μέλιτος τούτου
30 ἀλ{L'} ὅτι εἰ ἔφαγεν ἔσθων ὁ λαὸς σήμερον τῶν σκύλων τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν ὧν εὗρεν ὅτι νῦν ἂν μείζων ἦν ἡ πληγὴ ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις

31 καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἐν Μαχεμας καὶ ἐκοπίασεν ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα
32 καὶ ἐκλίθη ὁ λαὸς εἰς τὰ σκῦλα καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ λαὸς ποίμνια καὶ βουκόλια καὶ τέκνα βοῶν καὶ ἔσφαξεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ ἤσθιεν ὁ λαὸς σὺν τῷ αἵματι
33 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαουλ λέγοντες ἡμάρτηκεν ὁ λαὸς τῷ κυρίῳ φαγὼν σὺν τῷ αἵματι καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ ἐν Γεθθεμ κυλίσατέ μοι λίθον ἐνταῦθα μέγαν
34 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ διασπάρητε ἐν τῷ λαῷ καὶ εἴπατε αὐτοῖς προσαγαγεῖν ἐνταῦθα ἕκαστος τὸν μόσχον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕκαστος τὸ πρόβατον αὐτοῦ καὶ σφαζέτω ἐπὶ τούτου καὶ οὐ μὴ ἁμάρτητε τῷ κυρίῳ τοῦ ἐσθίειν σὺν τῷ αἵματι καὶ προσῆγεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἕκαστος τὸ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔσφαζον ἐκεῖ
35 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ Σαουλ θυσιαστήριον τῷ κυρίῳ τοῦτο ἤρξατο Σαουλ οἰκοδομῆσαι θυσιαστήριον τῷ κυρίῳ

36 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ καταβῶμεν ὀπίσω τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τὴν νύκτα καὶ διαρπάσωμεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἕως διαφαύσῃ ἡ ἡμέρα καὶ μὴ ὑπολίπωμεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἄνδρα καὶ εἶπαν πᾶν τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐνώπιόν σου ποίει καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἱερεύς προσέλθωμεν ἐνταῦθα πρὸς τὸν θεόν
37 καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν Σαουλ τὸν θεόν εἰ καταβῶ ὀπίσω τῶν ἀλλοφύλων εἰ παραδώσεις αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας Ισραηλ καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ
38 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ προσαγάγετε ἐνταῦθα πάσας τὰς γωνίας τοῦ Ισραηλ καὶ γνῶτε καὶ ἴδετε ἐν τίνι γέγονεν ἡ ἁμαρτία αὕτη σήμερον
39 ὅτι ζῇ κύριος ὁ σώσας τὸν Ισραηλ ὅτι ἐὰν ἀποκριθῇ κατὰ Ιωναθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ μου θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖται καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀποκρινόμενος ἐκ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ
40 καὶ εἶπεν παντὶ Ισραηλ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθε εἰς δουλείαν καὶ ἐγὼ καὶ Ιωναθαν ὁ υἱός μου ἐσόμεθα εἰς δουλείαν καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Σαουλ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐνώπιόν σου ποίει
41 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ τί ὅτι οὐκ ἀπεκρίθης τῷ δούλῳ σου σήμερον εἰ ἐν ἐμοὶ ἢ ἐν Ιωναθαν τῷ υἱῷ μου ἡ ἀδικία κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ δὸς δήλους καὶ ἐὰν τάδε εἴπῃς ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου Ισραηλ δὸς δὴ ὁσιότητα καὶ κληροῦται Ιωναθαν καὶ Σαουλ καὶ ὁ λαὸς ἐξῆλθεν
42 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ βάλετε ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Ιωναθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ μου ὃν ἂν κατακληρώσηται κύριος ἀποθανέτω καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Σαουλ οὐκ ἔστιν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο καὶ κατεκράτησεν Σαουλ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ βάλλουσιν ἀνὰ μέσον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Ιωναθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ κατακληροῦται Ιωναθαν

43 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ πρὸς Ιωναθαν ἀπάγγειλόν μοι τί πεποίηκας καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ Ιωναθαν καὶ εἶπεν γευσάμενος ἐγευσάμην ἐν ἄκρῳ τῷ σκήπτρῳ τῷ ἐν τῇ χειρί μου βραχὺ μέλι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀποθνῄσκω
44 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Σαουλ τάδε ποιήσαι μοι ὁ θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη ὅτι θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ σήμερον
45 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Σαουλ εἰ σήμερον θανατωθήσεται ὁ ποιήσας τὴν σωτηρίαν τὴν μεγάλην ταύτην ἐν Ισραηλ ζῇ κύριος εἰ πεσεῖται τῆς τριχὸς τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ὅτι ὁ λαὸς τοῦ θεοῦ ἐποίησεν τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην καὶ προσηύξατο ὁ λαὸς περὶ Ιωναθαν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ οὐκ ἀπέθανεν
46 καὶ ἀνέβη Σαουλ ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῶν

47 καὶ Σαουλ κατακληροῦται ἔργον ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπολέμει κύκλῳ πάντας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν Μωαβ καὶ εἰς τοὺς υἱοὺς Αμμων καὶ εἰς τοὺς υἱοὺς Εδωμ καὶ εἰς τὸν Βαιθεωρ καὶ εἰς βασιλέα Σουβα καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους οὗ ἂν ἐστράφη ἐσῴζετο
48 καὶ ἐποίησεν δύναμιν καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὸν Αμαληκ καὶ ἐξείλατο τὸν Ισραηλ ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν καταπατούντων αὐτόν
49 καὶ ἦσαν υἱοὶ Σαουλ Ιωναθαν καὶ Ιεσσιου καὶ Μελχισα καὶ ὀνόματα τῶν δύο θυγατέρων αὐτοῦ ὄνομα τῇ πρωτοτόκῳ Μεροβ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ δευτέρᾳ Μελχολ
50 καὶ ὄνομα τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ Αχινοομ θυγάτηρ Αχιμαας καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ἀρχιστρατήγῳ Αβεννηρ υἱὸς Νηρ υἱοῦ οἰκείου Σαουλ
51 καὶ Κις πατὴρ Σαουλ καὶ Νηρ πατὴρ Αβεννηρ υἱὸς Ιαμιν υἱοῦ Αβιηλ
52 καὶ ἦν ὁ πόλεμος κραταιὸς ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Σαουλ καὶ ἰδὼν Σαουλ πάντα ἄνδρα δυνατὸν καὶ πάντα ἄνδρα υἱὸν δυνάμεως καὶ συνήγαγεν αὐτοὺς πρὸς αὐτόν
