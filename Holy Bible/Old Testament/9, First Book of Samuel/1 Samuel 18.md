# First Book of Samuel 18 (RSVCE)

### Jonathan’s Covenant with David
1 When he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
2 And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return to his father’s house.
3 Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul.
4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his girdle.
5 And David went out and was successful wherever Saul sent him; so that Saul set him over the men of war. And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.
6 As they were coming home, when David returned from slaying the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with timbrels, with songs of joy, and with instruments of music.
7 And the women sang to one another as they made merry, “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.”
8 And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him; he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands; and what more can he have but the kingdom?”
9 And Saul eyed David from that day on.
### Saul Tries to Kill David
10 And on the morrow an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;
11 and Saul cast the spear, for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David evaded him twice.
12 Saul was afraid of David, because theLordwas with him but had departed from Saul.
13 So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
14 And David had success in all his undertakings; for theLordwas with him.
15 And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in awe of him.
16 But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.
### David Marries Michal
17 Then Saul said to David, “Here is my elder daughter Merab; I will give her to you for a wife; only be valiant for me and fight theLord’s battles.” For Saul thought, “Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.”
18 And David said to Saul, “Who am I, and who are my kinsfolk, my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”
19 But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Aʹdriel the Mehoʹlathite for a wife.
20 Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
21 Saul thought, “Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, “You shall now be my son-in-law.”
22 And Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David in private and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you; now then become the king’s son-in-law.’ ”
23 And Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, “Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and of no repute?”
24 And the servants of Saul told him, “Thus and so did David speak.”
25 Then Saul said, “Thus shall you say to David, ‘The king desires no marriage present except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged of the king’s enemies.’ ” Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
26 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the time had expired,
27 David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines; and David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife.
28 But when Saul saw and knew that theLordwas with David, and that all Israel loved him,
29 Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul was David’s enemy continually.
30 Then the princes of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was highly esteemed.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 18 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et factum est cum complesset loqui ad Saul, anima Jonathæ conglutinata est animæ David, et dilexit eum Jonathas quasi animam suam.
2 Tulitque eum Saul in die illa, et non concessit ei ut reverteretur in domum patris sui.
3 Inierunt autem David et Jonathas fœdus: diligebat enim eum quasi animam suam.
4 Nam expoliavit se Jonathas tunica qua erat indutus, et dedit eam David, et reliqua vestimenta sua, usque ad gladium et arcum suum, et usque ad balteum.

5 Egrediebatur quoque David ad omnia quæcumque misisset eum Saul, et prudenter se agebat: posuitque eum Saul super viros belli, et acceptus erat in oculis universi populi, maximeque in conspectu famulorum Saul.
6 Porro cum reverteretur percusso Philisthæo David, egressæ sunt mulieres de universis urbibus Israël, cantantes, chorosque ducentes in occursum Saul regis, in tympanis lætitiæ, et in sistris.
7 Et præcinebant mulieres, ludentes, atque dicentes:Percussit Saul mille,et David decem millia.
8 Iratus est autem Saul nimis, et displicuit in oculis ejus sermo iste: dixitque: Dederunt David decem millia, et mihi mille dederunt: quid ei superest, nisi solum regnum?
9 Non rectis ergo oculis Saul aspiciebat David a die illa et deinceps.
10 Post diem autem alteram, invasit spiritus Dei malus Saul, et prophetabat in medio domus suæ: David autem psallebat manu sua, sicut per singulos dies. Tenebatque Saul lanceam,
11 et misit eam, putans quod configere posset David cum pariete: et declinavit David a facie ejus secundo.

12 Et timuit Saul David, eo quod Dominus esset cum eo, et a se recessisset.
13 Amovit ergo eum Saul a se, et fecit eum tribunum super mille viros: et egrediebatur, et intrabat in conspectu populi.
14 In omnibus quoque viis suis David prudenter agebat, et Dominus erat cum eo.
15 Vidit itaque Saul quod prudens esset nimis, et cœpit cavere eum.
16 Omnis autem Israël et Juda diligebat David: ipse enim ingrediebatur et egrediebatur ante eos.
17 Dixitque Saul ad David: Ecce filia mea major Merob: ipsam dabo tibi uxorem: tantummodo esto vir fortis, et præliare bella Domini. Saul autem reputabat, dicens: Non sit manus mea in eum, sed sit super eum manus Philisthinorum.
18 Ait autem David ad Saul: Quis ego sum, aut quæ est vita mea, aut cognatio patris mei in Israël, ut fiam gener regis?
19 Factum est autem tempus cum deberet dari Merob filia Saul David, data est Hadrieli Molathitæ uxor.
20 Dilexit autem David Michol filia Saul altera. Et nuntiatum est Saul, et placuit ei.
21 Dixitque Saul: Dabo eam illi, ut fiat ei in scandalum, et sit super eum manus Philisthinorum. Dixitque Saul ad David: In duabus rebus gener meus eris hodie.

22 Et mandavit Saul servis suis: Loquimini ad David clam me, dicentes: Ecce places regi, et omnes servi ejus diligunt te: nunc ergo esto gener regis.
23 Et locuti sunt servi Saul in auribus David omnia verba hæc. Et ait David: Num parum videtur vobis, generum esse regis? ego autem sum vir pauper et tenuis.
24 Et renuntiaverunt servi Saul dicentes: Hujuscemodi verba locutus est David.
25 Dixit autem Saul: Sic loquimini ad David: Non habet rex sponsalia necesse, nisi tantum centum præputia Philisthinorum, ut fiat ultio de inimicis regis. Porro Saul cogitabat tradere David in manus Philisthinorum.
26 Cumque renuntiassent servi ejus David verba quæ dixerat Saul, placuit sermo in oculis David, ut fieret gener regis.
27 Et post paucos dies surgens David, abiit cum viris qui sub eo erant. Et percussit ex Philisthiim ducentos viros, et attulit eorum præputia et annumeravit ea regi, ut esset gener ejus. Dedit itaque Saul ei Michol filiam suam uxorem.

28 Et vidit Saul, et intellexit quod Dominus esset cum David. Michol autem filia Saul diligebat eum.
29 Et Saul magis cœpit timere David: factusque est Saul inimicus David cunctis diebus.
30 Et egressi sunt principes Philisthinorum. A principio autem egressionis eorum, prudentius se gerebat David quam omnes servi Saul, et celebre factum est nomen ejus nimis.

24 καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν οἱ παῖδες Σαουλ αὐτῷ κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα ἃ ἐλάλησεν Δαυιδ

28 καὶ εἶδεν Σαουλ ὅτι κύριος μετὰ Δαυιδ καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ ἠγάπα αὐτόν
29 καὶ προσέθετο εὐλαβεῖσθαι ἀπὸ Δαυιδ ἔτι
