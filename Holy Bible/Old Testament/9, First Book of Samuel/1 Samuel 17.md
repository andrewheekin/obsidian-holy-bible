# First Book of Samuel 17 (RSVCE)

### David and Goliath
1 Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; and they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azeʹkah, in Eʹphes-damʹmim.
2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines.
3 And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.
4 And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
5 He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze.
6 And he had greaves of bronze upon his legs, and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.
7 And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer went before him.
8 He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.
9 If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.”
10 And the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.”
11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
12 Now David was the son of an Ephʹrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years.
13 The three eldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliʹab the first-born, and next to him Abinʹadab, and the third Shammah.
14 David was the youngest; the three eldest followed Saul,
15 but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.
16 For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.
17 And Jesse said to David his son, “Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;
18 also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See how your brothers fare, and bring some token from them.”
19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
20 And David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took the provisions, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the encampment as the host was going forth to the battle line, shouting the war cry.
21 And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army.
22 And David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the ranks, and went and greeted his brothers.
23 As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.
24 All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were much afraid.
25 And the men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel; and the man who kills him, the king will enrich with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.”
26 And David said to the men who stood by him, “What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”
27 And the people answered him in the same way, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.”
28 Now Eliʹab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliʹab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption, and the evil of your heart; for you have come down to see the battle.”
29 And David said, “What have I done now? Was it not but a word?”
30 And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way; and the people answered him again as before.
31 When the words which David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul; and he sent for him.
32 And David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”
33 And Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.”
34 But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep sheep for his father; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock,
35 I went after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth; and if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him and killed him.
36 Your servant has killed both lions and bears; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.”
37 And David said, “TheLordwho delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and theLordbe with you!”
38 Then Saul clothed David with his armor; he put a helmet of bronze on his head, and clothed him with a coat of mail.
39 And David girded his sword over his armor, and he tried in vain to go, for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, “I cannot go with these; for I am not used to them.” And David put them off.
40 Then he took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in his shepherd’s bag or wallet; his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.
41 And the Philistine came on and drew near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him.
42 And when the Philistine looked, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, ruddy and comely in appearance.
43 And the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
44 The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field.”
45 Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin; but I come to you in the name of theLordof hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
46 This day theLordwill deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down, and cut off your head; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
47 and that all this assembly may know that theLordsaves not with sword and spear; for the battle is theLord’s and he will give you into our hand.”
48 When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.
49 And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.
50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; there was no sword in the hand of David.
51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
52 And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Sha-araʹim as far as Gath and Ekron.
53 And the Israelites came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
54 And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
55 When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?” And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.”
56 And the king said, “Inquire whose son the stripling is.”
57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
58 And Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 17 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Congregantes autem Philisthiim agmina sua in prælium, convenerunt in Socho Judæ: et castrametati sunt inter Socho et Azeca in finibus Dommim.
2 Porro Saul et filii Israël congregati venerunt in Vallem terebinthi, et direxerunt aciem ad pugnandum contra Philisthiim.
3 Et Philisthiim stabant super montem ex parte hac, et Israël stabat supra montem ex altera parte: vallisque erat inter eos.
4 Et egressus est vir spurius de castris Philisthinorum nomine Goliath, de Geth, altitudinis sex cubitorum et palmi:
5 et cassis ærea super caput ejus, et lorica squamata induebatur. Porro pondus loricæ ejus, quinque millia siclorum æris erat:
6 et ocreas æreas habebat in cruribus, et clypeus æreus tegebat humeros ejus.
7 Hastile autem hastæ ejus erat quasi liciatorium texentium: ipsum autem ferrum hastæ ejus sexcentos siclos habebat ferri: et armiger ejus antecedebat eum.

8 Stansque clamabat adversum phalangas Israël, et dicebat eis: Quare venistis parati ad prælium? numquid ego non sum Philisthæus, et vos servi Saul? eligite ex vobis virum, et descendat ad singulare certamen.
9 Si quiverit pugnare mecum, et percusserit me, erimus vobis servi: si autem ego prævaluero, et percussero eum, vos servi eritis, et servietis nobis.
10 Et aiebat Philisthæus: Ego exprobravi agminibus Israël hodie: date mihi virum, et ineat mecum singulare certamen.
11 Audiens autem Saul et omnes Israëlitæ sermones Philisthæi hujuscemodi, stupebant, et metuebant nimis.

12 David autem erat filius viri Ephrathæi, de quo supra dictum est, de Bethlehem Juda, cui nomen erat Isai, qui habebat octo filios, et erat vir in diebus Saul senex, et grandævus inter viros.
13 Abierunt autem tres filii ejus majores post Saul in prælium: et nomina trium filiorum ejus qui perrexerunt ad bellum, Eliab primogenitus, et secundus Abinadab, tertiusque Samma.
14 David autem erat minimus. Tribus ergo majoribus secutis Saulem,
15 abiit David, et reversus est a Saul ut pasceret gregem patris sui in Bethlehem.
16 Procedebat vero Philisthæus mane et vespere, et stabat quadraginta diebus.
17 Dixit autem Isai ad David filium suum: Accipe fratribus tuis ephi polentæ, et decem panes istos, et curre in castra ad fratres tuos,
18 et decem formellas casei has deferes ad tribunum: et fratres tuos visitabis, si recte agant: et cum quibus ordinati sunt, disce.

19 Saul autem, et illi, et omnes filii Israël, in Valle terebinthi pugnabant adversum Philisthiim.
20 Surrexit itaque David mane, et commendavit gregem custodi: et onustus abiit, sicut præceperat ei Isai. Et venit ad locum Magala, et ad exercitum, qui egressus ad pugnam vociferatus erat in certamine.
21 Direxerat enim aciem Israël, sed et Philisthiim ex adverso fuerant præparati.
22 Derelinquens ergo David vasa quæ attulerat sub manu custodis ad sarcinas, cucurrit ad locum certaminis, et interrogabat si omnia recte agerentur erga fratres suos.
23 Cumque adhuc ille loqueretur eis, apparuit vir ille spurius ascendens, Goliath nomine, Philisthæus de Geth, de castris Philisthinorum: et loquente eo hæc eadem verba audivit David.
24 Omnes autem Israëlitæ, cum vidissent virum, fugerunt a facie ejus, timentes eum valde.
25 Et dixit unus quispiam de Israël: Num vidistis virum hunc, qui ascendit? ad exprobrandum enim Israëli ascendit. Virum ergo qui percusserit eum, ditabit rex divitiis magnis, et filiam suam dabit ei, et domum patris ejus faciet absque tributo in Israël.
26 Et ait David ad viros qui stabant secum, dicens: Quid dabitur viro qui percusserit Philisthæum hunc, et tulerit opprobrium de Israël? quis enim est hic Philisthæus incircumcisus, qui exprobravit acies Dei viventis?
27 Referebat autem ei populus eumdem sermonem, dicens: Hæc dabuntur viro qui percusserit eum.

28 Quod cum audisset Eliab frater ejus major, loquente eo cum aliis, iratus est contra David, et ait: Quare venisti, et quare dereliquisti pauculas oves illas in deserto? Ego novi superbiam tuam, et nequitiam cordis tui: quia ut videres prælium, descendisti.
29 Et dixit David: Quid feci? numquid non verbum est?
30 Et declinavit paululum ab eo ad alium: dixitque eumdem sermonem. Et respondit ei populus verbum sicut prius.
31 Audita sunt autem verba quæ locutus est David, et annuntiata in conspectu Saul.
32 Ad quem cum fuisset adductus, locutus est ei: Non concidat cor cujusquam in eo: ego servus tuus vadam, et pugnabo adversus Philisthæum.
33 Et ait Saul ad David: Non vales resistere Philisthæo isti, nec pugnare adversus eum, quia puer es: hic autem vir bellator est ab adolescentia sua.
34 Dixitque David ad Saul: Pascebat servus tuus patris sui gregem, et veniebat leo vel ursus, et tollebat arietem de medio gregis:
35 et persequebar eos, et percutiebam, eruebamque de ore eorum: et illi consurgebant adversum me, et apprehendebam mentum eorum, et suffocabam, interficiebamque eos.
36 Nam et leonem et ursum interfeci ego servus tuus: erit igitur et Philisthæus hic incircumcisus quasi unus ex eis. Nunc vadam, et auferam opprobrium populi: quoniam quis est iste Philisthæus incircumcisus, qui ausus est maledicere exercitui Dei viventis?
37 Et ait David: Dominus qui eripuit me de manu leonis, et de manu ursi, ipse me liberabit de manu Philisthæi hujus. Dixit autem Saul ad David: Vade, et Dominus tecum sit.
38 Et induit Saul David vestimentis suis, et imposuit galeam æream super caput ejus, et vestivit eum lorica.
39 Accinctus ergo David gladio ejus super vestem suam, cœpit tentare si armatus posset incedere: non enim habebat consuetudinem. Dixitque David ad Saul: Non possum sic incedere, quia non usum habeo.Et deposuit ea,
40 et tulit baculum suum, quem semper habebat in manibus: et elegit sibi quinque limpidissimos lapides de torrente, et misit eos in peram pastoralem quam habebat secum, et fundam manu tulit: et processit adversum Philisthæum.

41 Ibat autem Philisthæus incedens, et appropinquans adversum David, et armiger ejus ante eum.
42 Cumque inspexisset Philisthæus, et vidisset David, despexit eum. Erat enim adolescens, rufus, et pulcher aspectu.
43 Et dixit Philisthæus ad David: Numquid ego canis sum, quod tu venis ad me cum baculo? Et maledixit Philisthæus David in diis suis:
44 dixitque ad David: Veni ad me, et dabo carnes tuas volatilibus cæli et bestiis terræ.
45 Dixit autem David ad Philisthæum: Tu venis ad me cum gladio, et hasta, et clypeo: ego autem venio ad te in nomine Domini exercituum, Dei agminum Israël quibus exprobrasti
46 hodie, et dabit te Dominus in manu mea, et percutiam te, et auferam caput tuum a te: et dabo cadavera castrorum Philisthiim hodie volatilibus cæli, et bestiis terræ, ut sciat omnis terra quia est Deus in Israël,
47 et noverit universa ecclesia hæc, quia non in gladio nec in hasta salvat Dominus: ipsius enim est bellum, et tradet vos in manus nostras.

48 Cum ergo surrexisset Philisthæus, et veniret, et appropinquaret contra David, festinavit David et cucurrit ad pugnam ex adverso Philisthæi.
49 Et misit manum suam in peram, tulitque unum lapidem, et funda jecit, et circumducens percussit Philisthæum in fronte: et infixus est lapis in fronte ejus, et cecidit in faciem suam super terram.
50 Prævaluitque David adversum Philisthæum in funda et lapide, percussumque Philisthæum interfecit. Cumque gladium non haberet in manu David,
51 cucurrit, et stetit super Philisthæum, et tulit gladium ejus, et eduxit eum de vagina sua: et interfecit eum, præciditque caput ejus. Videntes autem Philisthiim quod mortuus esset fortissimus eorum, fugerunt.
52 Et consurgentes viri Israël et Juda vociferati sunt, et persecuti sunt Philisthæos usque dum venirent in vallem, et usque ad portas Accaron: cecideruntque vulnerati de Philisthiim in via Saraim, et usque ad Geth, et usque ad Accaron.
53 Et revertentes filii Israël postquam persecuti fuerant Philisthæos, invaserunt castra eorum.

54 Assumens autem David caput Philisthæi, attulit illud in Jerusalem: arma vero ejus posuit in tabernaculo suo.
55 Eo autem tempore quo viderat Saul David egredientem contra Philisthæum, ait ad Abner principem militiæ: De qua stirpe descendit hic adolescens, Abner? Dixitque Abner: Vivit anima tua, rex, si novi.
56 Et ait rex: Interroga tu, cujus filius sit iste puer.
57 Cumque regressus esset David, percusso Philisthæo, tulit eum Abner, et introduxit coram Saule, caput Philisthæi habentem in manu.
58 Et ait ad eum Saul: De qua progenie es, o adolescens? Dixitque David: Filius servi tui Isai Bethlehemitæ ego sum.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 17 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ συνάγουσιν ἀλλόφυλοι τὰς παρεμβολὰς αὐτῶν εἰς πόλεμον καὶ συνάγονται εἰς Σοκχωθ τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν ἀνὰ μέσον Σοκχωθ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Αζηκα ἐν Εφερμεμ

52 καὶ ἀνίστανται ἄνδρες Ισραηλ καὶ Ιουδα καὶ ἠλάλαξαν καὶ κατεδίωξαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἕως εἰσόδου Γεθ καὶ ἕως τῆς πύλης Ἀσκαλῶνος καὶ ἔπεσαν τραυματίαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τῶν πυλῶν καὶ ἕως Γεθ καὶ ἕως Ακκαρων
53 καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν ἄνδρες Ισραηλ ἐκκλίνοντες ὀπίσω τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ κατεπάτουν τὰς παρεμβολὰς αὐτῶν

54 καὶ ἔλαβεν Δαυιδ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὴν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἔθηκεν ἐν τῷ σκηνώματι αὐτοῦ
