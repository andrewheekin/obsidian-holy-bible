# First Book of Samuel 28 (RSVCE)

1 In those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war, to fight against Israel. And Aʹchish said to David, “Understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army.”
2 David said to Aʹchish, “Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.” And Aʹchish said to David, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
### Saul Consults a Medium
3 Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the wizards out of the land.
4 The Philistines assembled, and came and encamped at Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboʹa.
5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
6 And when Saul inquired of theLord, theLorddid not answer him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets.
7 Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him, “Behold, there is a medium at Endor.”
8 So Saul disguised himself and put on other garments, and went, he and two men with him; and they came to the woman by night. And he said, “Divine for me by a spirit, and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you.”
9 The woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the wizards from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life to bring about my death?”
10 But Saul swore to her by theLord, “As theLordlives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”
11 Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”
12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul.”
13 The king said to her, “Have no fear; what do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.”
14 He said to her, “What is his appearance?” And she said, “An old man is coming up; and he is wrapped in a robe.” And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.
15 Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul answered, “I am in great distress; for the Philistines are warring against me, and God has turned away from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams; therefore I have summoned you to tell me what I shall do.”
16 And Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since theLordhas turned from you and become your enemy?
17 TheLordhas done to you as he spoke by me; for theLordhas torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, David.
18 Because you did not obey the voice of theLord, and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amʹalek, therefore theLordhas done this thing to you this day.
19 Moreover theLordwill give Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me; theLordwill give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.”
20 Then Saul fell at once full length upon the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.
21 And the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was terrified, she said to him, “Behold, your handmaid has hearkened to you; I have taken my life in my hand, and have hearkened to what you have said to me.
22 Now therefore, you also hearken to your handmaid; let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.”
23 He refused, and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he hearkened to their words. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
24 Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and she took flour, and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread of it,
25 and she put it before Saul and his servants; and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 28 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem in diebus illis, congregaverunt Philisthiim agmina sua, ut præpararentur ad bellum contra Israël: dixitque Achis ad David: Sciens nunc scito quoniam mecum egredieris in castris, tu et viri tui.
2 Dixitque David ad Achis: Nunc scies quæ facturus est servus tuus. Et ait Achis ad David: Et ego custodem capitis mei ponam te cunctis diebus.

3 Samuel autem mortuus est, planxitque eum omnis Israël, et sepelierunt eum in Ramatha urbe sua. Et Saul abstulit magos et hariolos de terra.
4 Congregatique sunt Philisthiim, et venerunt, et castrametati sunt in Sunam: congregavit autem et Saul universum Israël, et venit in Gelboë.
5 Et vidit Saul castra Philisthiim, et timuit, et expavit cor ejus nimis.
6 Consuluitque Dominum, et non respondit ei neque per somnia, neque per sacerdotes, neque per prophetas.
7 Dixitque Saul servis suis: Quærite mihi mulierem habentem pythonem, et vadam ad eam, et sciscitabor per illam. Et dixerunt servi ejus ad eum: Est mulier pythonem habens in Endor.
8 Mutavit ergo habitum suum, vestitusque est aliis vestimentis, et abiit ipse, et duo viri cum eo: veneruntque ad mulierem nocte, et ait illi: Divina mihi in pythone, et suscita mihi quem dixero tibi.
9 Et ait mulier ad eum: Ecce, tu nosti quanta fecerit Saul, et quomodo eraserit magos et hariolos de terra: quare ergo insidiaris animæ meæ, ut occidar?
10 Et juravit ei Saul in Domino, dicens: Vivit Dominus, quia non eveniet tibi quidquam mali propter hanc rem.
11 Dixitque ei mulier: Quem suscitabo tibi? Qui ait: Samuelem mihi suscita.

12 Cum autem vidisset mulier Samuelem, exclamavit voce magna, et dixit ad Saul: Quare imposuisti mihi? tu es enim Saul.
13 Dixitque ei rex: Noli timere: quid vidisti? Et ait mulier ad Saul: Deos vidi ascendentes de terra.
14 Dixitque ei: Qualis est forma ejus? Quæ ait: Vir senex ascendit, et ipse amictus est pallio. Et intellexit Saul quod Samuel esset, et inclinavit se super faciem suam in terra, et adoravit.

15 Dixit autem Samuel ad Saul: Quare inquietasti me ut suscitarer? Et ait Saul: Coarctor nimis: siquidem Philisthiim pugnant adversum me, et Deus recessit a me, et exaudire me noluit neque in manu prophetarum, neque per somnia: vocavi ergo te, ut ostenderes mihi quid faciam.
16 Et ait Samuel: Quid interrogas me, cum Dominus recesserit a te, et transierit ad æmulum tuum?
17 Faciet enim tibi Dominus sicut locutus est in manu mea, et scindet regnum tuum de manu tua et dabit illud proximo tuo David:
18 quia non obedisti voci Domini, neque fecisti iram furoris ejus in Amalec: idcirco quod pateris, fecit tibi Dominus hodie.
19 Et dabit Dominus etiam Israël tecum in manus Philisthiim: cras autem tu et filii tui mecum eritis: sed et castra Israël tradet Dominus in manus Philisthiim.

20 Statimque Saul cecidit porrectus in terram: extimuerat enim verba Samuelis, et robur non erat in eo, quia non comederat panem tota die illa.
21 Ingressa est itaque mulier illa ad Saul (conturbatus enim erat valde), dixitque ad eum: Ecce obedivit ancilla tua voci tuæ, et posui animam meam in manu mea: et audivi sermones tuos, quos locutus es ad me.
22 Nunc igitur audi et tu vocem ancillæ tuæ, et ponam coram te buccellam panis, ut comedens convalescas, et possis iter agere.
23 Qui renuit, et ait: Non comedam. Coëgerunt autem eum servi sui et mulier, et tandem audita voce eorum surrexit de terra, et sedit super lectum.
24 Mulier autem illa habebat vitulum pascualem in domo, et festinavit, et occidit eum: tollensque farinam, miscuit eam, et coxit azyma,
25 et posuit ante Saul et ante servos ejus. Qui cum comedissent, surrexerunt, et ambulaverunt per totam noctem illam.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 28 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις καὶ συναθροίζονται ἀλλόφυλοι ἐν ταῖς παρεμβολαῖς αὐτῶν ἐξελθεῖν πολεμεῖν μετὰ Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν Αγχους πρὸς Δαυιδ γινώσκων γνώσει ὅτι με{T'} ἐμοῦ ἐξελεύσει εἰς πόλεμον σὺ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες σου
2 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Αγχους οὕτω νῦν γνώσει ἃ ποιήσει ὁ δοῦλός σου καὶ εἶπεν Αγχους πρὸς Δαυιδ οὕτως ἀρχισωματοφύλακα θήσομαί σε πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας

3 καὶ Σαμουηλ ἀπέθανεν καὶ ἐκόψαντο αὐτὸν πᾶς Ισραηλ καὶ θάπτουσιν αὐτὸν ἐν Αρμαθαιμ ἐν πόλει αὐτοῦ καὶ Σαουλ περιεῖλεν τοὺς ἐγγαστριμύθους καὶ τοὺς γνώστας ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς
4 καὶ συναθροίζονται οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ ἔρχονται καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν εἰς Σωμαν καὶ συναθροίζει Σαουλ πάντα ἄνδρα Ισραηλ καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν εἰς Γελβουε
5 καὶ εἶδεν Σαουλ τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐφοβήθη καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ σφόδρα
6 καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν Σαουλ διὰ κυρίου καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ κύριος ἐν τοῖς ἐνυπνίοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς δήλοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς προφήταις
7 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ ζητήσατέ μοι γυναῖκα ἐγγαστρίμυθον καὶ πορεύσομαι πρὸς αὐτὴν καὶ ζητήσω ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ εἶπαν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτόν ἰδοὺ γυνὴ ἐγγαστρίμυθος ἐν Αενδωρ
8 καὶ συνεκαλύψατο Σαουλ καὶ περιεβάλετο ἱμάτια ἕτερα καὶ πορεύεται αὐτὸς καὶ δύο ἄνδρες με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔρχονται πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα νυκτὸς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ μάντευσαι δή μοι ἐν τῷ ἐγγαστριμύθῳ καὶ ἀνάγαγέ μοι ὃν ἐὰν εἴπω σοι
9 καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς αὐτόν ἰδοὺ δὴ σὺ οἶδας ὅσα ἐποίησεν Σαουλ ὡς ἐξωλέθρευσεν τοὺς ἐγγαστριμύθους καὶ τοὺς γνώστας ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἵνα τί σὺ παγιδεύεις τὴν ψυχήν μου θανατῶσαι αὐτήν
10 καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῇ Σαουλ λέγων ζῇ κύριος εἰ ἀπαντήσεταί σοι ἀδικία ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ
11 καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνή τίνα ἀναγάγω σοι καὶ εἶπεν τὸν Σαμουηλ ἀνάγαγέ μοι

12 καὶ εἶδεν ἡ γυνὴ τὸν Σαμουηλ καὶ ἀνεβόησεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς Σαουλ ἵνα τί παρελογίσω με καὶ σὺ εἶ Σαουλ
13 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ βασιλεύς μὴ φοβοῦ εἰπὸν τίνα ἑόρακας καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Θεοὺς ἑόρακα ἀναβαίνοντας ἐκ τῆς γῆς
14 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ τί ἔγνως καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἄνδρα ὄρθιον ἀναβαίνοντα ἐκ τῆς γῆς καὶ οὗτος διπλοΐδα ἀναβεβλημένος καὶ ἔγνω Σαουλ ὅτι Σαμουηλ οὗτος καὶ ἔκυψεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ

15 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ ἵνα τί παρηνώχλησάς μοι ἀναβῆναί με καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ θλίβομαι σφόδρα καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι πολεμοῦσιν ἐν ἐμοί καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἀφέστηκεν ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐπακήκοέν μοι ἔτι καὶ ἐν χειρὶ τῶν προφητῶν καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐνυπνίοις καὶ νῦν κέκληκά σε γνωρίσαι μοι τί ποιήσω
16 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ ἵνα τί ἐπερωτᾷς με καὶ κύριος ἀφέστηκεν ἀπὸ σοῦ καὶ γέγονεν μετὰ τοῦ πλησίον σου
17 καὶ πεποίηκεν κύριός σοι καθὼς ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρί μου καὶ διαρρήξει κύριος τὴν βασιλείαν σου ἐκ χειρός σου καὶ δώσει αὐτὴν τῷ πλησίον σου τῷ Δαυιδ
18 διότι οὐκ ἤκουσας φωνῆς κυρίου καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησας θυμὸν ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ ἐν Αμαληκ διὰ τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα ἐποίησεν κύριός σοι τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ
19 καὶ παραδώσει κύριος τὸν Ισραηλ μετὰ σοῦ εἰς χεῖρας ἀλλοφύλων καὶ αὔριον σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου μετὰ σοῦ πεσοῦνται καὶ τὴν παρεμβολὴν Ισραηλ δώσει κύριος εἰς χεῖρας ἀλλοφύλων

20 καὶ ἔσπευσεν Σαουλ καὶ ἔπεσεν ἑστηκὼς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ ἐφοβήθη σφόδρα ἀπὸ τῶν λόγων Σαμουηλ καὶ ἰσχὺς ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἦν ἔτι οὐ γὰρ ἔφαγεν ἄρτον ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν καὶ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην
21 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς Σαουλ καὶ εἶδεν ὅτι ἔσπευσεν σφόδρα καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν ἰδοὺ δὴ ἤκουσεν ἡ δούλη σου τῆς φωνῆς σου καὶ ἐθέμην τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐν τῇ χειρί μου καὶ ἤκουσα τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἐλάλησάς μοι
22 καὶ νῦν ἄκουσον δὴ φωνῆς τῆς δούλης σου καὶ παραθήσω ἐνώπιόν σου ψωμὸν ἄρτου καὶ φάγε καὶ ἔσται ἐν σοὶ ἰσχύς ὅτι πορεύσῃ ἐν ὁδῷ
23 καὶ οὐκ ἐβουλήθη φαγεῖν καὶ παρεβιάζοντο αὐτὸν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ γυνή καὶ ἤκουσεν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνέστη ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τὸν δίφρον
24 καὶ τῇ γυναικὶ ἦν δάμαλις νομὰς ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ καὶ ἔσπευσεν καὶ ἔθυσεν αὐτὴν καὶ ἔλαβεν ἄλευρα καὶ ἐφύρασεν καὶ ἔπεψεν ἄζυμα
25 καὶ προσήγαγεν ἐνώπιον Σαουλ καὶ ἐνώπιον τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἀνέστησαν καὶ ἀπῆλθον τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην
