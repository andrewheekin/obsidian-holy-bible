# First Book of Samuel 1 (RSVCE)

### Samuel’s Birth and Dedication
1 There was a certain man of Ramathaʹim-zoʹphim of the hill country of Eʹphraim, whose name was Elkaʹnah the son of Jeroʹham, son of Eliʹhu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Eʹphraimite.
2 He had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninʹnah. And Peninʹnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
3 Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to theLordof hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinʹehas, were priests of theLord.
4 On the day when Elkaʹnah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninʹnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters;
5 and, although he loved Hannah, he would give Hannah only one portion, because theLordhad closed her womb.
6 And her rival used to provoke her sorely, to irritate her, because theLordhad closed her womb.
7 So it went on year by year; as often as she went up to the house of theLord, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.
8 And Elkaʹnah, her husband, said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?”
9 After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of theLord.
10 She was deeply distressed and prayed to theLord, and wept bitterly.
11 And she vowed a vow and said, “OLordof hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy maidservant, and remember me, and not forget thy maidservant, but wilt give to thy maidservant a son, then I will give him to theLordall the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.”
12 As she continued praying before theLord, Eli observed her mouth.
13 Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman.
14 And Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunken? Put away your wine from you.”
15 But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman sorely troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before theLord.
16 Do not regard your maidservant as a base woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.”
17 Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have made to him.”
18 And she said, “Let your maidservant find favor in your eyes.” Then the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no longer sad.
19 They rose early in the morning and worshiped before theLord; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkaʹnah knew Hannah his wife, and theLordremembered her;
20 and in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, “I have asked him of theLord.”
21 And the man Elkaʹnah and all his house went up to offer to theLordthe yearly sacrifice, and to pay his vow.
22 But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, that he may appear in the presence of theLord, and abide there for ever.”
23 Elkaʹnah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you, wait until you have weaned him; only, may theLordestablish his word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son, until she weaned him.
24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine; and she brought him to the house of theLordat Shiloh; and the child was young.
25 Then they slew the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.
26 And she said, “Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to theLord.
27 For this child I prayed; and theLordhas granted me my petition which I made to him.
28 Therefore I have lent him to theLord; as long as he lives, he is lent to theLord.” And theycworshiped theLordthere.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 1 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Fuit vir unus de Ramathaimsophim, de monte Ephraim, et nomen ejus Elcana, filius Jeroham, filii Eliu, filii Thohu, filii Suph, Ephrathæus:
2 et habuit duas uxores, nomen uni Anna, et nomen secundæ Phenenna. Fueruntque Phenennæ filii: Annæ autem non erant liberi.
3 Et ascendebat vir ille de civitate sua statutis diebus, ut adoraret et sacrificaret Domino exercituum in Silo. Erant autem ibi duo filii Heli, Ophni et Phinees, sacerdotes Domini.
4 Venit ergo dies, et immolavit Elcana, deditque Phenennæ uxori suæ, et cunctis filiis ejus et filiabus, partes:
5 Annæ autem dedit partem unam tristis, quia Annam diligebat. Dominus autem concluserat vulvam ejus.
6 Affligebat quoque eam æmula ejus, et vehementer angebat, in tantum ut exprobraret quod Dominus conclusisset vulvam ejus:
7 sicque faciebat per singulos annos: cum redeunte tempore ascenderent ad templum Domini, et sic provocabat eam: porro illa flebat, et non capiebat cibum.
8 Dixit ergo ei Elcana vir suus: Anna, cur fles? et quare non comedis? et quam ob rem affligitur cor tuum? numquid non ego melior tibi sum, quam decem filii?

9 Surrexit autem Anna postquam comederat et biberat in Silo. Et Heli sacerdote sedente super sellam ante postes templi Domini,
10 cum esset Anna amaro animo, oravit ad Dominum, flens largiter,
11 et votum vovit, dicens: Domine exercituum, si respiciens videris afflictionem famulæ tuæ, et recordatus mei fueris, nec oblitus ancillæ tuæ, dederisque servæ tuæ sexum virilem: dabo eum Domino omnibus diebus vitæ ejus, et novacula non ascendet super caput ejus.
12 Factum est autem, cum illa multiplicaret preces coram Domino, ut Heli observaret os ejus.
13 Porro Anna loquebatur in corde suo, tantumque labia illius movebantur, et vox penitus non audiebatur. Æstimavit ergo eam Heli temulentam,
14 dixitque ei: Usquequo ebria eris? digere paulisper vinum, quo mades.
15 Respondens Anna: Nequaquam, inquit, domine mi: nam mulier infelix nimis ego sum: vinumque et omne quod inebriare potest, non bibi, sed effudi animam meam in conspectu Domini.
16 Ne reputes ancillam tuam quasi unam de filiabus Belial: quia ex multitudine doloris et mœroris mei locuta sum usque in præsens.
17 Tunc Heli ait ei: Vade in pace: et Deus Israël det tibi petitionem tuam quam rogasti eum.
18 Et illa dixit: Utinam inveniat ancilla tua gratiam in oculis tuis. Et abiit mulier in viam suam, et comedit, vultusque illius non sunt amplius in diversa mutati.
19 Et surrexerunt mane, et adoraverunt coram Domino: reversique sunt, et venerunt in domum suam Ramatha.Cognovit autem Elcana Annam uxorem suam: et recordatus est ejus Dominus.
20 Et factum est post circulum dierum, concepit Anna, et peperit filium: vocavitque nomen ejus Samuel, eo quod a Domino postulasset eum.
21 Ascendit autem vir ejus Elcana, et omnis domus ejus, ut immolaret Domino hostiam solemnem, et votum suum.
22 Et Anna non ascendit: dixit enim viro suo: Non vadam donec ablactetur infans, et ducam eum, ut appareat ante conspectum Domini, et maneat ibi jugiter.
23 Et ait ei Elcana vir suus: Fac quod bonum tibi videtur, et mane donec ablactes eum: precorque ut impleat Dominus verbum suum. Mansit ergo mulier, et lactavit filium suum, donec amoveret eum a lacte.
24 Et adduxit eum secum, postquam ablactaverat, in vitulis tribus, et tribus modiis farinæ, et amphora vini, et adduxit eum ad domum Domini in Silo. Puer autem erat adhuc infantulus:
25 et immolaverunt vitulum, et obtulerunt puerum Heli.
26 Et ait Anna: Obsecro mi domine, vivit anima tua, domine: ego sum illa mulier, quæ steti coram te hic orans Dominum.
27 Pro puero isto oravi, et dedit mihi Dominus petitionem meam quam postulavi eum.
28 Idcirco et ego commodavi eum Domino cunctis diebus quibus fuerit commodatus Domino. Et adoraverunt ibi Dominum.Et oravit Anna, et ait:


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 1 (Septuagint)

1 ἄνθρωπος ἦν ἐξ Αρμαθαιμ Σιφα ἐξ ὄρους Εφραιμ καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Ελκανα υἱὸς Ιερεμεηλ υἱοῦ Ηλιου υἱοῦ Θοκε ἐν Νασιβ Εφραιμ
2 καὶ τούτῳ δύο γυναῖκες ὄνομα τῇ μιᾷ Αννα καὶ ὄνομα τῇ δευτέρᾳ Φεννανα καὶ ἦν τῇ Φεννανα παιδία καὶ τῇ Αννα οὐκ ἦν παιδίον
3 καὶ ἀνέβαινεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας ἐκ πόλεως αὐτοῦ ἐξ Αρμαθαιμ προσκυνεῖν καὶ θύειν τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ σαβαωθ εἰς Σηλω καὶ ἐκεῖ Ηλι καὶ οἱ δύο υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ Οφνι καὶ Φινεες ἱερεῖς τοῦ κυρίου
4 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἡμέρᾳ καὶ ἔθυσεν Ελκανα καὶ ἔδωκεν τῇ Φεννανα γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῆς καὶ ταῖς θυγατράσιν αὐτῆς μερίδας
5 καὶ τῇ Αννα ἔδωκεν μερίδα μίαν ὅτι οὐκ ἦν αὐτῇ παιδίον πλὴν ὅτι τὴν Ανναν ἠγάπα Ελκανα ὑπὲρ ταύτην καὶ κύριος ἀπέκλεισεν τὰ περὶ τὴν μήτραν αὐτῆς
6 ὅτι οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ κύριος παιδίον κατὰ τὴν θλῖψιν αὐτῆς καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἀθυμίαν τῆς θλίψεως αὐτῆς καὶ ἠθύμει διὰ τοῦτο ὅτι συνέκλεισεν κύριος τὰ περὶ τὴν μήτραν αὐτῆς τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι αὐτῇ παιδίον
7 οὕτως ἐποίει ἐνιαυτὸν κα{T'} ἐνιαυτὸν ἐν τῷ ἀναβαίνειν αὐτὴν εἰς οἶκον κυρίου καὶ ἠθύμει καὶ ἔκλαιεν καὶ οὐκ ἤσθιεν
8 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Ελκανα ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς Αννα καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἰδοὺ ἐγώ κύριε καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ τί ἐστίν σοι ὅτι κλαίεις καὶ ἵνα τί οὐκ ἐσθίεις καὶ ἵνα τί τύπτει σε ἡ καρδία σου οὐκ ἀγαθὸς ἐγώ σοι ὑπὲρ δέκα τέκνα

9 καὶ ἀνέστη Αννα μετὰ τὸ φαγεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐν Σηλω καὶ κατέστη ἐνώπιον κυρίου καὶ Ηλι ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τοῦ δίφρου ἐπὶ τῶν φλιῶν ναοῦ κυρίου
10 καὶ αὐτὴ κατώδυνος ψυχῇ καὶ προσηύξατο πρὸς κύριον καὶ κλαίουσα ἔκλαυσεν
11 καὶ ηὔξατο εὐχὴν κυρίῳ λέγουσα Αδωναι κύριε ελωαι σαβαωθ ἐὰν ἐπιβλέπων ἐπιβλέψῃς ἐπὶ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τῆς δούλης σου καὶ μνησθῇς μου καὶ δῷς τῇ δούλῃ σου σπέρμα ἀνδρῶν καὶ δώσω αὐτὸν ἐνώπιόν σου δοτὸν ἕως ἡμέρας θανάτου αὐτοῦ καὶ οἶνον καὶ μέθυσμα οὐ πίεται καὶ σίδηρος οὐκ ἀναβήσεται ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ
12 καὶ ἐγενήθη ὅτε ἐπλήθυνεν προσευχομένη ἐνώπιον κυρίου καὶ Ηλι ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐφύλαξεν τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς
13 καὶ αὐτὴ ἐλάλει ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ χείλη αὐτῆς ἐκινεῖτο καὶ φωνὴ αὐτῆς οὐκ ἠκούετο καὶ ἐλογίσατο αὐτὴν Ηλι εἰς μεθύουσαν
14 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ τὸ παιδάριον Ηλι ἕως πότε μεθυσθήσῃ περιελοῦ τὸν οἶνόν σου καὶ πορεύου ἐκ προσώπου κυρίου
15 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Αννα καὶ εἶπεν οὐχί κύριε γυνή ᾗ σκληρὰ ἡμέρα ἐγώ εἰμι καὶ οἶνον καὶ μέθυσμα οὐ πέπωκα καὶ ἐκχέω τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐνώπιον κυρίου
16 μὴ δῷς τὴν δούλην σου εἰς θυγατέρα λοιμήν ὅτι ἐκ πλήθους ἀδολεσχίας μου ἐκτέτακα ἕως νῦν
17 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ηλι καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ πορεύου εἰς εἰρήνην ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ δῴη σοι πᾶν αἴτημά σου ὃ ᾐτήσω πα{R'} αὐτοῦ
18 καὶ εἶπεν εὗρεν ἡ δούλη σου χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἡ γυνὴ εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῆς καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ κατάλυμα αὐτῆς καὶ ἔφαγεν μετὰ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ ἔπιεν καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς οὐ συνέπεσεν ἔτι
19 καὶ ὀρθρίζουσιν τὸ πρωὶ καὶ προσκυνοῦσιν τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ πορεύονται τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῶν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ελκανα εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ Αρμαθαιμ καὶ ἔγνω τὴν Ανναν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐμνήσθη αὐτῆς κύριος
20 καὶ συνέλαβεν καὶ ἐγενήθη τῷ καιρῷ τῶν ἡμερῶν καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱόν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Σαμουηλ καὶ εἶπεν ὅτι παρὰ κυρίου θεοῦ σαβαωθ ᾐτησάμην αὐτόν
21 καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ ἄνθρωπος Ελκανα καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ θῦσαι ἐν Σηλωμ τὴν θυσίαν τῶν ἡμερῶν καὶ τὰς εὐχὰς αὐτοῦ καὶ πάσας τὰς δεκάτας τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ
22 καὶ Αννα οὐκ ἀνέβη με{T'} αὐτοῦ ὅτι εἶπεν τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς ἕως τοῦ ἀναβῆναι τὸ παιδάριον ἐὰν ἀπογαλακτίσω αὐτό καὶ ὀφθήσεται τῷ προσώπῳ κυρίου καὶ καθήσεται ἐκεῖ ἕως αἰῶνος
23 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Ελκανα ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς ποίει τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου κάθου ἕως ἂν ἀπογαλακτίσῃς αὐτό ἀλλὰ στήσαι κύριος τὸ ἐξελθὸν ἐκ τοῦ στόματός σου καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἡ γυνὴ καὶ ἐθήλασεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς ἕως ἂν ἀπογαλακτίσῃ αὐτόν
24 καὶ ἀνέβη με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἰς Σηλωμ ἐν μόσχῳ τριετίζοντι καὶ ἄρτοις καὶ οιφι σεμιδάλεως καὶ νεβελ οἴνου καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς οἶκον κυρίου ἐν Σηλωμ καὶ τὸ παιδάριον με{T'} αὐτῶν
25 καὶ προσήγαγον ἐνώπιον κυρίου καὶ ἔσφαξεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ τὴν θυσίαν ἣν ἐποίει ἐξ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ προσήγαγεν τὸ παιδάριον καὶ ἔσφαξεν τὸν μόσχον καὶ προσήγαγεν Αννα ἡ μήτηρ τοῦ παιδαρίου πρὸς Ηλι
26 καὶ εἶπεν ἐν ἐμοί κύριε ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου ἐγὼ ἡ γυνὴ ἡ καταστᾶσα ἐνώπιόν σου ἐν τῷ προσεύξασθαι πρὸς κύριον
27 ὑπὲρ τοῦ παιδαρίου τούτου προσηυξάμην καὶ ἔδωκέν μοι κύριος τὸ αἴτημά μου ὃ ᾐτησάμην πα{R'} αὐτοῦ
28 κἀγὼ κιχρῶ αὐτὸν τῷ κυρίῳ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ζῇ αὐτός χρῆσιν τῷ κυρίῳ
