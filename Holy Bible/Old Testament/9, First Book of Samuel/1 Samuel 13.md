# First Book of Samuel 13 (RSVCE)

### Saul’s Unlawful Sacrifice
1 Saul was . . . years old when he began to reign; and he reigned . . . and two years over Israel.
2 Saul chose three thousand men of Israel; two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibʹe-ah of Benjamin; the rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent.
3 Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines which was at Geba; and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear.”
4 And all Israel heard it said that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines. And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.
5 And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude; they came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aʹven.
6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in straits (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns,
7 or crossed the fords of the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
8 He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.
9 So Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering.
10 As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him and salute him.
11 Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash,
12 I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down upon me at Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of theLord’; so I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering.”
13 And Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of theLordyour God, which he commanded you; for now theLordwould have established your kingdom over Israel for ever.
14 But now your kingdom shall not continue; theLordhas sought out a man after his own heart; and theLordhas appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept what theLordcommanded you.”
### Preparations for Battle
15 And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal to Gibʹe-ah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.
16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
17 And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies; one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shuʹal,
18 another company turned toward Beth-horʹon, and another company turned toward the border that looks down upon the valley of Zeboʹim toward the wilderness.
19 Now there was no smith to be found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears”;
20 but every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, or his sickle;
21 and the charge was a pim for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads.
22 So on the day of the battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.
23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Filius unius anni erat Saul cum regnare cœpisset: duobus autem annis regnavit super Israël.
2 Et elegit sibi Saul tria millia de Israël: et erant cum Saul duo millia in Machmas, et in monte Bethel: mille autem cum Jonatha in Gabaa Benjamin: porro ceterum populum remisit unumquemque in tabernacula sua.
3 Et percussit Jonathas stationem Philisthinorum quæ erat in Gabaa. Quod cum audissent Philisthiim, Saul cecinit buccina in omni terra, dicens: Audiant Hebræi.
4 Et universus Israël audivit hujuscemodi famam: Percussit Saul stationem Philisthinorum, et erexit se Israël adversus Philisthiim. Clamavit ergo populus post Saul in Galgala.

5 Et Philisthiim congregati sunt ad præliandum contra Israël, triginta millia curruum, et sex millia equitum, et reliquum vulgus, sicut arena quæ est in littore maris plurima. Et ascendentes castrametati sunt in Machmas ad orientem Bethaven.
6 Quod cum vidissent viri Israël se in arcto positos (afflictus enim erat populus), absconderunt se in speluncis, et in abditis, in petris quoque, et in antris, et in cisternis.
7 Hebræi autem transierunt Jordanem in terram Gad et Galaad.Cumque adhuc esset Saul in Galgala, universus populus perterritus est qui sequebatur eum.

8 Et expectavit septem diebus juxta placitum Samuelis, et non venit Samuel in Galgala, dilapsusque est populus ab eo.
9 Ait ergo Saul: Afferte mihi holocaustum et pacifica. Et obtulit holocaustum.
10 Cumque complesset offerens holocaustum, ecce Samuel veniebat: et egressus est Saul obviam ei ut salutaret eum.
11 Locutusque est ad eum Samuel: Quid fecisti? Respondit Saul: Quia vidi quod populus dilaberetur a me, et tu non veneras juxta placitos dies, porro Philisthiim congregati fuerant in Machmas,
12 dixi: Nunc descendent Philisthiim ad me in Galgala, et faciem Domini non placavi. Necessitate compulsus, obtuli holocaustum.
13 Dixitque Samuel ad Saul: Stulte egisti, nec custodisti mandata Domini Dei tui quæ præcepit tibi. Quod si non fecisses, jam nunc præparasset Dominus regnum tuum super Israël in sempiternum:
14 sed nequaquam regnum tuum ultra consurget. Quæsivit Dominus sibi virum juxta cor suum: et præcepit ei Dominus ut esset dux super populum suum, eo quod non servaveris quæ præcepit Dominus.

15 Surrexit autem Samuel, et ascendit de Galgalis in Gabaa Benjamin. Et reliqui populi ascenderunt post Saul obviam populo, qui expugnabant eos venientes de Galgala in Gabaa, in colle Benjamin. Et recensuit Saul populum qui inventi fuerant cum eo, quasi sexcentos viros.
16 Et Saul et Jonathas filius ejus, populusque qui inventus fuerat cum eis, erat in Gabaa Benjamin: porro Philisthiim consederant in Machmas.
17 Et egressi sunt ad prædandum de castris Philisthinorum tres cunei. Unus cuneus pergebat contra viam Ephra ad terram Sual:
18 porro alius ingrediebatur per viam Beth-horon: tertius autem verterat se ad iter termini imminentis valli Seboim contra desertum.
19 Porro faber ferrarius non inveniebatur in omni terra Israël: caverant enim Philisthiim, ne forte facerent Hebræi gladium aut lanceam.
20 Descendebat ergo omnis Israël ad Philisthiim, ut exacueret unusquisque vomerem suum, et ligonem, et securim, et sarculum.
21 Retusæ itaque erant acies vomerum, et ligonum, et tridentum, et securium, usque ad stimulum corrigendum.
22 Cumque venisset dies prælii, non est inventus ensis et lancea in manu totius populi qui erat cum Saule et Jonatha, excepto Saul et Jonatha filio ejus.
23 Egressa est autem statio Philisthiim, ut transcenderet in Machmas.

2 καὶ ἐκλέγεται Σαουλ ἑαυτῷ τρεῖς χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν ἐκ τῶν ἀνδρῶν Ισραηλ καὶ ἦσαν μετὰ Σαουλ δισχίλιοι ἐν Μαχεμας καὶ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Βαιθηλ χίλιοι ἦσαν μετὰ Ιωναθαν ἐν Γαβεε τοῦ Βενιαμιν καὶ τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ λαοῦ ἐξαπέστειλεν ἕκαστον εἰς τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ
3 καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ιωναθαν τὸν Νασιβ τὸν ἀλλόφυλον τὸν ἐν τῷ βουνῷ καὶ ἀκούουσιν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ Σαουλ σάλπιγγι σαλπίζει εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν λέγων ἠθετήκασιν οἱ δοῦλοι
4 καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ ἤκουσεν λεγόντων πέπαικεν Σαουλ τὸν Νασιβ τὸν ἀλλόφυλον καὶ ᾐσχύνθησαν Ισραηλ ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις καὶ ἀνεβόησαν ὁ λαὸς ὀπίσω Σαουλ ἐν Γαλγαλοις

5 καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι συνάγονται εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἀναβαίνουσιν ἐπὶ Ισραηλ τριάκοντα χιλιάδες ἁρμάτων καὶ ἓξ χιλιάδες ἱππέων καὶ λαὸς ὡς ἡ ἄμμος ἡ παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν τῷ πλήθει καὶ ἀναβαίνουσιν καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν ἐν Μαχεμας ἐξ ἐναντίας Βαιθων κατὰ νότου
6 καὶ ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ εἶδεν ὅτι στενῶς αὐτῷ μὴ προσάγειν αὐτόν καὶ ἐκρύβη ὁ λαὸς ἐν τοῖς σπηλαίοις καὶ ἐν ταῖς μάνδραις καὶ ἐν ταῖς πέτραις καὶ ἐν τοῖς βόθροις καὶ ἐν τοῖς λάκκοις
7 καὶ οἱ διαβαίνοντες διέβησαν τὸν Ιορδάνην εἰς γῆν Γαδ καὶ Γαλααδ καὶ Σαουλ ἔτι ἦν ἐν Γαλγαλοις καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐξέστη ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ

8 καὶ διέλιπεν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας τῷ μαρτυρίῳ ὡς εἶπεν Σαμουηλ καὶ οὐ παρεγένετο Σαμουηλ εἰς Γαλγαλα καὶ διεσπάρη ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
9 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ προσαγάγετε ὅπως ποιήσω ὁλοκαύτωσιν καὶ εἰρηνικάς καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν
10 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς συνετέλεσεν ἀναφέρων τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν καὶ Σαμουηλ παραγίνεται καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Σαουλ εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῷ εὐλογῆσαι αὐτόν
11 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ τί πεποίηκας καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ ὅτι εἶδον ὡς διεσπάρη ὁ λαὸς ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ σὺ οὐ παρεγένου ὡς διετάξω ἐν τῷ μαρτυρίῳ τῶν ἡμερῶν καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι συνήχθησαν εἰς Μαχεμας
12 καὶ εἶπα νῦν καταβήσονται οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι πρός με εἰς Γαλγαλα καὶ τοῦ προσώπου τοῦ κυρίου οὐκ ἐδεήθην καὶ ἐνεκρατευσάμην καὶ ἀνήνεγκα τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν
13 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ πρὸς Σαουλ μεματαίωταί σοι ὅτι οὐκ ἐφύλαξας τὴν ἐντολήν μου ἣν ἐνετείλατό σοι κύριος ὡς νῦν ἡτοίμασεν κύριος τὴν βασιλείαν σου ἕως αἰῶνος ἐπὶ Ισραηλ
14 καὶ νῦν ἡ βασιλεία σου οὐ στήσεται καὶ ζητήσει κύριος ἑαυτῷ ἄνθρωπον κατὰ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐντελεῖται κύριος αὐτῷ εἰς ἄρχοντα ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ὅτι οὐκ ἐφύλαξας ὅσα ἐνετείλατό σοι κύριος

15 καὶ ἀνέστη Σαμουηλ καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκ Γαλγαλων εἰς ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ κατάλειμμα τοῦ λαοῦ ἀνέβη ὀπίσω Σαουλ εἰς ἀπάντησιν ὀπίσω τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ πολεμιστοῦ αὐτῶν παραγενομένων ἐκ Γαλγαλων εἰς Γαβαα Βενιαμιν καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο Σαουλ τὸν λαὸν τὸν εὑρεθέντα με{T'} αὐτοῦ ὡς ἑξακοσίους ἄνδρας
16 καὶ Σαουλ καὶ Ιωναθαν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ λαὸς οἱ εὑρεθέντες με{T'} αὐτῶν ἐκάθισαν ἐν Γαβεε Βενιαμιν καὶ ἔκλαιον καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι παρεμβεβλήκεισαν εἰς Μαχεμας
17 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν διαφθείρων ἐξ ἀγροῦ ἀλλοφύλων τρισὶν ἀρχαῖς ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μία ἐπιβλέπουσα ὁδὸν Γοφερα ἐπὶ γῆν Σωγαλ
18 καὶ ἡ μία ἀρχὴ ἐπιβλέπουσα ὁδὸν Βαιθωρων καὶ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μία ἐπιβλέπουσα ὁδὸν Γαβεε τὴν εἰσκύπτουσαν ἐπὶ Γαι τὴν Σαβιν
19 καὶ τέκτων σιδήρου οὐχ εὑρίσκετο ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Ισραηλ ὅτι εἶπον οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι μὴ ποιήσωσιν οἱ Εβραῖοι ῥομφαίαν καὶ δόρυ
20 καὶ κατέβαινον πᾶς Ισραηλ εἰς γῆν ἀλλοφύλων χαλκεύειν ἕκαστος τὸ θέριστρον αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ σκεῦος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕκαστος τὴν ἀξίνην αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ δρέπανον αὐτοῦ
21 καὶ ἦν ὁ τρυγητὸς ἕτοιμος τοῦ θερίζειν τὰ δὲ σκεύη ἦν τρεῖς σίκλοι εἰς τὸν ὀδόντα καὶ τῇ ἀξίνῃ καὶ τῷ δρεπάνῳ ὑπόστασις ἦν ἡ αὐτή
22 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τοῦ πολέμου Μαχεμας καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη ῥομφαία καὶ δόρυ ἐν χειρὶ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ μετὰ Σαουλ καὶ μετὰ Ιωναθαν καὶ εὑρέθη τῷ Σαουλ καὶ τῷ Ιωναθαν υἱῷ αὐτοῦ
23 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ ὑποστάσεως τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τὴν ἐν τῷ πέραν Μαχεμας
