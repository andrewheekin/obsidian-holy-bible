# First Book of Samuel 10 (RSVCE)

1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, “Has not theLordanointed you to be prince over his people Israel? And you shall reign over the people of theLordand you will save them from the hand of their enemies round about. And this shall be the sign to you that theLordhas anointed you to be prince over his heritage.
2 When you depart from me today you will meet two men by Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, ‘The asses which you went to seek are found, and now your father has ceased to care about the asses and is anxious about you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?” ’
3 Then you shall go on from there further and come to the oak of Tabor; three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three kids, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.
4 And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand.
5 After that you shall come to Gibʹe-ath-eloʹhim, where there is a garrison of the Philistines; and there, as you come to the city, you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, prophesying.
6 Then the spirit of theLordwill come mightily upon you, and you shall prophesy with them and be turned into another man.
7 Now when these signs meet you, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.
8 And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I am coming to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do.”
### Saul Prophesies
9 When he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all these signs came to pass that day.
10 When they came to Gibʹe-ah, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.
11 And when all who knew him before saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, “What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”
12 And a man of the place answered, “And who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
13 When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
14 Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To seek the asses; and when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”
15 And Saul’s uncle said, “Pray, tell me what Samuel said to you.”
16 And Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the asses had been found.” But about the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him anything.
### Saul Proclaimed King
17 Now Samuel called the people together to theLordat Mizpah;
18 and he said to the people of Israel, “Thus says theLord, the God of Israel, ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.’
19 But you have this day rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said, ‘No! but set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before theLordby your tribes and by your thousands.”
20 Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.
21 He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the family of the Matrites was taken by lot; finally he brought the family of the Matrites near man by man, and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot. But when they sought him, he could not be found.
22 So they inquired again of theLord, “Did the man come hither?” and theLordsaid, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.”
23 Then they ran and fetched him from there; and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.
24 And Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom theLordhas chosen? There is none like him among all the people.” And all the people shouted, “Long live the king!”
25 Then Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship; and he wrote them in a book and laid it up before theLord. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his home.
26 Saul also went to his home at Gibʹe-ah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched.
27 But some worthless fellows said, “How can this man save us?” And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Tulit autem Samuel lenticulam olei, et effudit super caput ejus: et deosculatus est eum, et ait: Ecce unxit te Dominus super hæreditatem suam in principem, et liberabis populum suum de manibus inimicorum ejus qui in circuitu ejus sunt. Et hoc tibi signum, quia unxit te Deus in principem.
2 Cum abieris hodie a me, invenies duos viros juxta sepulchrum Rachel in finibus Benjamin, in meridie: dicentque tibi: Inventæ sunt asinæ ad quas ieras perquirendas: et intermissis pater tuus asinis, sollicitus est pro vobis, et dicit: Quid faciam de filio meo?
3 Cumque abieris inde, et ultra transieris, et veneris ad quercum Thabor, invenient te ibi tres viri ascendentes ad Deum in Bethel, unus portans tres hædos, et alius tres tortas panis, et alius portans lagenam vini.
4 Cumque te salutaverint, dabunt tibi duos panes, et accipies de manu eorum.
5 Post hæc venies in collem Dei, ubi est statio Philisthinorum: et cum ingressus fueris ibi urbem, obvium habebis gregem prophetarum descendentium de excelso, et ante eos psalterium, et tympanum, et tibiam, et citharam, ipsosque prophetantes.
6 Et insiliet in te spiritus Domini, et prophetabis cum eis, et mutaberis in virum alium.
7 Quando ergo evenerint signa hæc omnia tibi, fac quæcumque invenerit manus tua, quia Dominus tecum est.
8 Et descendes ante me in Galgala (ego quippe descendam ad te), ut offeras oblationem, et immoles victimas pacificas: septem diebus expectabis, donec veniam ad te, et ostendam tibi quid facias.

9 Itaque cum avertisset humerum suum ut abiret a Samuele, immutavit ei Deus cor aliud, et venerunt omnia signa hæc in die illa.
10 Veneruntque ad prædictum collem, et ecce cuneus prophetarum obvius ei: et insiluit super eum spiritus Domini, et prophetavit in medio eorum.
11 Videntes autem omnes qui noverant eum heri et nudiustertius quod esset cum prophetis, et prophetaret, dixerunt ad invicem: Quænam res accidit filio Cis? num et Saul inter prophetas?
12 Responditque alius ad alterum, dicens: Et quis pater eorum? Propterea versum est in proverbium: Num et Saul inter prophetas?
13 Cessavit autem prophetare, et venit ad excelsum.
14 Dixitque patruus Saul ad eum, et ad puerum ejus: Quo abistis? Qui responderunt: Quærere asinas: quas cum non reperissemus, venimus ad Samuelem.
15 Et dixit ei patruus suus: Indica mihi quid dixerit tibi Samuel.
16 Et ait Saul ad patruum suum: Indicavit nobis quia inventæ essent asinæ. De sermone autem regni non indicavit ei quem locutus fuerat ei Samuel.

17 Et convocavit Samuel populum ad Dominum in Maspha:
18 et ait ad filios Israël: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Ego eduxi Israël de Ægypto, et erui vos de manu Ægyptiorum, et de manu omnium regum qui affligebant vos.
19 Vos autem hodie projecistis Deum vestrum, qui solus salvavit vos de universis malis et tribulationibus vestris: et dixistis: Nequaquam: sed regem constitue super nos. Nunc ergo state coram Domino per tribus vestras, et per familias.
20 Et applicuit Samuel omnes tribus Israël, et cecidit sors tribus Benjamin.
21 Et applicuit tribum Benjamin et cognationes ejus, et cecidit cognatio Metri: et pervenit usque ad Saul filium Cis. Quæsierunt ergo eum, et non est inventus.
22 Et consuluerunt post hæc Dominum utrumnam venturus esset illuc. Responditque Dominus: Ecce absconditus est domi.
23 Cucurrerunt itaque et tulerunt eum inde: stetitque in medio populi, et altior fuit universo populo ab humero et sursum.
24 Et ait Samuel ad omnem populum: Certe videtis quem elegit Dominus, quoniam non sit similis illi in omni populo. Et clamavit omnis populus, et ait: Vivat rex.

25 Locutus est autem Samuel ad populum legem regni, et scripsit in libro, et reposuit coram Domino: et dimisit Samuel omnem populum, singulos in domum suam.
26 Sed et Saul abiit in domum suam in Gabaa: et abiit cum eo pars exercitus, quorum tetigerat Deus corda.
27 Filii vero Belial dixerunt: Num salvare nos poterit iste? Et despexerunt eum, et non attulerunt ei munera: ille vero dissimulabat se audire.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 10 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἔλαβεν Σαμουηλ τὸν φακὸν τοῦ ἐλαίου καὶ ἐπέχεεν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐφίλησεν αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ οὐχὶ κέχρικέν σε κύριος εἰς ἄρχοντα ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ σὺ ἄρξεις ἐν λαῷ κυρίου καὶ σὺ σώσεις αὐτὸν ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν αὐτοῦ κυκλόθεν καὶ τοῦτό σοι τὸ σημεῖον ὅτι ἔχρισέν σε κύριος ἐπὶ κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ εἰς ἄρχοντα
2 ὡς ἂν ἀπέλθῃς σήμερον ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ εὑρήσεις δύο ἄνδρας πρὸς τοῖς τάφοις Ραχηλ ἐν τῷ ὁρίῳ Βενιαμιν ἁλλομένους μεγάλα καὶ ἐροῦσίν σοι εὕρηνται αἱ ὄνοι ἃς ἐπορεύθητε ζητεῖν καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ πατήρ σου ἀποτετίνακται τὸ ῥῆμα τῶν ὄνων καὶ ἐδαψιλεύσατο δ{I'} ὑμᾶς λέγων τί ποιήσω ὑπὲρ τοῦ υἱοῦ μου
3 καὶ ἀπελεύσει ἐκεῖθεν καὶ ἐπέκεινα ἥξεις ἕως τῆς δρυὸς Θαβωρ καὶ εὑρήσεις ἐκεῖ τρεῖς ἄνδρας ἀναβαίνοντας πρὸς τὸν θεὸν εἰς Βαιθηλ ἕνα αἴροντα τρία αἰγίδια καὶ ἕνα αἴροντα τρία ἀγγεῖα ἄρτων καὶ ἕνα αἴροντα ἀσκὸν οἴνου
4 καὶ ἐρωτήσουσίν σε τὰ εἰς εἰρήνην καὶ δώσουσίν σοι δύο ἀπαρχὰς ἄρτων καὶ λήμψῃ ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτῶν
5 καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσῃ εἰς τὸν βουνὸν τοῦ θεοῦ οὗ ἐστιν ἐκεῖ τὸ ἀνάστημα τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἐκεῖ Νασιβ ὁ ἀλλόφυλος καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἂν εἰσέλθητε ἐκεῖ εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἀπαντήσεις χορῷ προφητῶν καταβαινόντων ἐκ τῆς Βαμα καὶ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν νάβλα καὶ τύμπανον καὶ αὐλὸς καὶ κινύρα καὶ αὐτοὶ προφητεύοντες
6 καὶ ἐφαλεῖται ἐπὶ σὲ πνεῦμα κυρίου καὶ προφητεύσεις με{T'} αὐτῶν καὶ στραφήσῃ εἰς ἄνδρα ἄλλον
7 καὶ ἔσται ὅταν ἥξει τὰ σημεῖα ταῦτα ἐπὶ σέ ποίει πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν εὕρῃ ἡ χείρ σου ὅτι θεὸς μετὰ σοῦ
8 καὶ καταβήσῃ ἔμπροσθεν τῆς Γαλγαλα καὶ ἰδοὺ καταβαίνω πρὸς σὲ ἀνενεγκεῖν ὁλοκαύτωσιν καὶ θυσίας εἰρηνικάς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας διαλείψεις ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν με πρὸς σέ καὶ γνωρίσω σοι ἃ ποιήσεις

9 καὶ ἐγενήθη ὥστε ἐπιστραφῆναι τῷ ὤμῳ αὐτοῦ ἀπελθεῖν ἀπὸ Σαμουηλ μετέστρεψεν αὐτῷ ὁ θεὸς καρδίαν ἄλλην καὶ ἦλθεν πάντα τὰ σημεῖα ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ
10 καὶ ἔρχεται ἐκεῖθεν εἰς τὸν βουνόν καὶ ἰδοὺ χορὸς προφητῶν ἐξ ἐναντίας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἥλατο ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν πνεῦμα θεοῦ καὶ ἐπροφήτευσεν ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν
11 καὶ ἐγενήθησαν πάντες οἱ εἰδότες αὐτὸν ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην καὶ εἶδον καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἐν μέσῳ τῶν προφητῶν καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ τί τοῦτο τὸ γεγονὸς τῷ υἱῷ Κις ἦ καὶ Σαουλ ἐν προφήταις
12 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη τις αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπεν καὶ τίς πατὴρ αὐτοῦ διὰ τοῦτο ἐγενήθη εἰς παραβολήν ἦ καὶ Σαουλ ἐν προφήταις
13 καὶ συνετέλεσεν προφητεύων καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς τὸν βουνόν
14 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ οἰκεῖος αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ ποῦ ἐπορεύθητε καὶ εἶπαν ζητεῖν τὰς ὄνους καὶ εἴδαμεν ὅτι οὐκ εἰσίν καὶ εἰσήλθομεν πρὸς Σαμουηλ
15 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ οἰκεῖος πρὸς Σαουλ ἀπάγγειλον δή μοι τί εἶπέν σοι Σαμουηλ
16 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ πρὸς τὸν οἰκεῖον αὐτοῦ ἀπήγγειλεν ἀπαγγέλλων μοι ὅτι εὕρηνται αἱ ὄνοι τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα τῆς βασιλείας οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ

17 καὶ παρήγγειλεν Σαμουηλ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ πρὸς κύριον εἰς Μασσηφα
18 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ τάδε εἶπεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ λέγων ἐγὼ ἀνήγαγον τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐξειλάμην ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς Φαραω βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐκ πασῶν τῶν βασιλειῶν τῶν θλιβουσῶν ὑμᾶς
19 καὶ ὑμεῖς σήμερον ἐξουθενήκατε τὸν θεόν ὃς αὐτός ἐστιν ὑμῶν σωτὴρ ἐκ πάντων τῶν κακῶν ὑμῶν καὶ θλίψεων ὑμῶν καὶ εἴπατε οὐχί ἀλ{L'} ἢ ὅτι βασιλέα στήσεις ἐ{F'} ἡμῶν καὶ νῦν κατάστητε ἐνώπιον κυρίου κατὰ τὰ σκῆπτρα ὑμῶν καὶ κατὰ τὰς φυλὰς ὑμῶν
20 καὶ προσήγαγεν Σαμουηλ πάντα τὰ σκῆπτρα Ισραηλ καὶ κατακληροῦται σκῆπτρον Βενιαμιν
21 καὶ προσάγει σκῆπτρον Βενιαμιν εἰς φυλάς καὶ κατακληροῦται φυλὴ Ματταρι καὶ προσάγουσιν τὴν φυλὴν Ματταρι εἰς ἄνδρας καὶ κατακληροῦται Σαουλ υἱὸς Κις καὶ ἐζήτει αὐτόν καὶ οὐχ εὑρίσκετο
22 καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν Σαμουηλ ἔτι ἐν κυρίῳ εἰ ἔρχεται ὁ ἀνὴρ ἐνταῦθα καὶ εἶπεν κύριος ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς κέκρυπται ἐν τοῖς σκεύεσιν
23 καὶ ἔδραμεν καὶ λαμβάνει αὐτὸν ἐκεῖθεν καὶ κατέστησεν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ὑψώθη ὑπὲρ πάντα τὸν λαὸν ὑπὲρ ὠμίαν καὶ ἐπάνω
24 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαόν εἰ ἑοράκατε ὃν ἐκλέλεκται ἑαυτῷ κύριος ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ ὅμοιος ἐν πᾶσιν ὑμῖν καὶ ἔγνωσαν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς καὶ εἶπαν ζήτω ὁ βασιλεύς

25 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἔγραψεν ἐν βιβλίῳ καὶ ἔθηκεν ἐνώπιον κυρίου καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν Σαμουηλ πάντα τὸν λαόν καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ
26 καὶ Σαουλ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ εἰς Γαβαα καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν υἱοὶ δυνάμεων ὧν ἥψατο κύριος καρδίας αὐτῶν μετὰ Σαουλ
27 καὶ υἱοὶ λοιμοὶ εἶπαν τί σώσει ἡμᾶς οὗτος καὶ ἠτίμασαν αὐτὸν καὶ οὐκ ἤνεγκαν αὐτῷ δῶρα
