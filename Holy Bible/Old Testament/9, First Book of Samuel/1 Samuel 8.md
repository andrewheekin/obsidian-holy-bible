# First Book of Samuel 8 (RSVCE)

### Israel Demands a King
1 When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel.
2 The name of his first-born son was Joʹel, and the name of his second, Abiʹjah; they were judges in Beer-sheba.
3 Yet his sons did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after gain; they took bribes and perverted justice.
4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah,
5 and said to him, “Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint for us a king to govern us like all the nations.”
6 But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to govern us.” And Samuel prayed to theLord.
7 And theLordsaid to Samuel, “Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.
8 According to all the deeds which they have done to me, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are also doing to you.
9 Now then, hearken to their voice; only, you shall solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.”
10 So Samuel told all the words of theLordto the people who were asking a king from him.
11 He said, “These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen, and to run before his chariots;
12 and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.
13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.
14 He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants.
15 He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.
16 He will take your menservants and maidservants, and the best of your cattle and your asses, and put them to his work.
17 He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.
18 And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves; but theLordwill not answer you in that day.”
### Israel’s Request for a King Granted
19 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No! but we will have a king over us,
20 that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our battles.”
21 And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of theLord.
22 And theLordsaid to Samuel, “Hearken to their voice, and make them a king.” Samuel then said to the men of Israel, “Go every man to his city.”


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 8 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem cum senuisset Samuel, posuit filios suos judices Israël.
2 Fuitque nomen filii ejus primogeniti Joël: et nomen secundi Abia, judicum in Bersabee.
3 Et non ambulaverunt filii illius in viis ejus: sed declinaverunt post avaritiam, acceperuntque munera, et perverterunt judicium.
4 Congregati ergo universi majores natu Israël, venerunt ad Samuelem in Ramatha.
5 Dixeruntque ei: Ecce tu senuisti, et filii tui non ambulant in viis tuis: constitue nobis regem, ut judicet nos, sicut et universæ habent nationes.
6 Displicuit sermo in oculis Samuelis, eo quod dixissent: Da nobis regem, ut judicet nos. Et oravit Samuel ad Dominum.
7 Dixit autem Dominus ad Samuelem: Audi vocem populi in omnibus quæ loquuntur tibi: non enim te abjecerunt, sed me, ne regnem super eos.
8 Juxta omnia opera sua quæ fecerunt, a die qua eduxi eos de Ægypto usque ad diem hanc: sicut dereliquerunt me, et servierunt diis alienis, sic faciunt etiam tibi.
9 Nunc ergo vocem eorum audi: verumtamen contestare eos, et prædic eis jus regis, qui regnaturus est super eos.

10 Dixit itaque Samuel omnia verba Domini ad populum, qui petierat a se regem.
11 Et ait: Hoc erit jus regis, qui imperaturus est vobis: filios vestros tollet, et ponet in curribus suis: facietque sibi equites et præcursores quadrigarum suarum,
12 et constituet sibi tribunos, et centuriones, et aratores agrorum suorum, et messores segetum, et fabros armorum et curruum suorum.
13 Filias quoque vestras faciet sibi unguentarias, et focarias, et panificas.
14 Agros quoque vestros, et vineas, et oliveta optima tollet, et dabit servis suis.
15 Sed et segetes vestras et vinearum reditus addecimabit, ut det eunuchis et famulis suis.
16 Servos etiam vestros, et ancillas, et juvenes optimos, et asinos, auferet, et ponet in opere suo.
17 Greges quoque vestros addecimabit, vosque eritis ei servi.
18 Et clamabitis in die illa a facie regis vestri, quem elegistis vobis: et non exaudiet vos Dominus in die illa, quia petistis vobis regem.

19 Noluit autem populus audire vocem Samuelis, sed dixerunt: Nequaquam: rex enim erit super nos,
20 et erimus nos quoque sicut omnes gentes: et judicabit nos rex noster, et egredietur ante nos, et pugnabit bella nostra pro nobis.
21 Et audivit Samuel omnia verba populi, et locutus est ea in auribus Domini.
22 Dixit autem Dominus ad Samuelem: Audi vocem eorum, et constitue super eos regem. Et ait Samuel ad viros Israël: Vadat unusquisque in civitatem suam.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 8 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐγήρασεν Σαμουηλ καὶ κατέστησεν τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ δικαστὰς τῷ Ισραηλ
2 καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ πρωτότοκος Ιωηλ καὶ ὄνομα τοῦ δευτέρου Αβια δικασταὶ ἐν Βηρσαβεε
3 καὶ οὐκ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐν ὁδῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξέκλιναν ὀπίσω τῆς συντελείας καὶ ἐλάμβανον δῶρα καὶ ἐξέκλινον δικαιώματα
4 καὶ συναθροίζονται ἄνδρες Ισραηλ καὶ παραγίνονται εἰς Αρμαθαιμ πρὸς Σαμουηλ
5 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ ἰδοὺ σὺ γεγήρακας καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου οὐ πορεύονται ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ σου καὶ νῦν κατάστησον ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς βασιλέα δικάζειν ἡμᾶς καθὰ καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ ἔθνη
6 καὶ ἦν πονηρὸν τὸ ῥῆμα ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Σαμουηλ ὡς εἶπαν δὸς ἡμῖν βασιλέα δικάζειν ἡμᾶς καὶ προσηύξατο Σαμουηλ πρὸς κύριον
7 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Σαμουηλ ἄκουε τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ λαοῦ καθὰ ἂν λαλήσωσίν σοι ὅτι οὐ σὲ ἐξουθενήκασιν ἀλ{L'} ἢ ἐμὲ ἐξουδενώκασιν τοῦ μὴ βασιλεύειν ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν
8 κατὰ πάντα τὰ ποιήματα ἃ ἐποίησάν μοι ἀ{F'} ἧς ἡμέρας ἀνήγαγον αὐτοὺς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης καὶ ἐγκατέλιπόν με καὶ ἐδούλευον θεοῖς ἑτέροις οὕτως αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσιν καὶ σοί
9 καὶ νῦν ἄκουε τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν πλὴν ὅτι διαμαρτυρόμενος διαμαρτύρῃ αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀπαγγελεῖς αὐτοῖς τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ βασιλέως ὃς βασιλεύσει ἐ{P'} αὐτούς

10 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ πᾶν τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τοὺς αἰτοῦντας πα{R'} αὐτοῦ βασιλέα
11 καὶ εἶπεν τοῦτο ἔσται τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ βασιλέως ὃς βασιλεύσει ἐ{F'} ὑμᾶς τοὺς υἱοὺς ὑμῶν λήμψεται καὶ θήσεται αὐτοὺς ἐν ἅρμασιν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἱππεῦσιν αὐτοῦ καὶ προτρέχοντας τῶν ἁρμάτων αὐτοῦ
12 καὶ θέσθαι αὐτοὺς ἑαυτῷ χιλιάρχους καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους καὶ θερίζειν θερισμὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ τρυγᾶν τρυγητὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ποιεῖν σκεύη πολεμικὰ αὐτοῦ καὶ σκεύη ἁρμάτων αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ὑμῶν λήμψεται εἰς μυρεψοὺς καὶ εἰς μαγειρίσσας καὶ εἰς πεσσούσας
14 καὶ τοὺς ἀγροὺς ὑμῶν καὶ τοὺς ἀμπελῶνας ὑμῶν καὶ τοὺς ἐλαιῶνας ὑμῶν τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς λήμψεται καὶ δώσει τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ τὰ σπέρματα ὑμῶν καὶ τοὺς ἀμπελῶνας ὑμῶν ἀποδεκατώσει καὶ δώσει τοῖς εὐνούχοις αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ
16 καὶ τοὺς δούλους ὑμῶν καὶ τὰς δούλας ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ βουκόλια ὑμῶν τὰ ἀγαθὰ καὶ τοὺς ὄνους ὑμῶν λήμψεται καὶ ἀποδεκατώσει εἰς τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ τὰ ποίμνια ὑμῶν ἀποδεκατώσει καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθε αὐτῷ δοῦλοι
18 καὶ βοήσεσθε ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ προσώπου βασιλέως ὑμῶν οὗ ἐξελέξασθε ἑαυτοῖς καὶ οὐκ ἐπακούσεται κύριος ὑμῶν ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ὅτι ὑμεῖς ἐξελέξασθε ἑαυτοῖς βασιλέα

19 καὶ οὐκ ἠβούλετο ὁ λαὸς ἀκοῦσαι τοῦ Σαμουηλ καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ οὐχί ἀλ{L'} ἢ βασιλεὺς ἔσται ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς
20 καὶ ἐσόμεθα καὶ ἡμεῖς κατὰ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη καὶ δικάσει ἡμᾶς βασιλεὺς ἡμῶν καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἔμπροσθεν ἡμῶν καὶ πολεμήσει τὸν πόλεμον ἡμῶν
21 καὶ ἤκουσεν Σαμουηλ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰ ὦτα κυρίου
22 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Σαμουηλ ἄκουε τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν καὶ βασίλευσον αὐτοῖς βασιλέα καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ πρὸς ἄνδρας Ισραηλ ἀποτρεχέτω ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῦ
