# First Book of Samuel 23 (RSVCE)

### David Saves the City of Keilah
1 Now they told David, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Ke-iʹlah, and are robbing the threshing floors.”
2 Therefore David inquired of theLord, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” And theLordsaid to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Ke-iʹlah.”
3 But David’s men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Ke-iʹlah against the armies of the Philistines?”
4 Then David inquired of theLordagain. And theLordanswered him, “Arise, go down to Ke-iʹlah; for I will give the Philistines into your hand.”
5 And David and his men went to Ke-iʹlah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and made a great slaughter among them. So David delivered the inhabitants of Ke-iʹlah.
6 When Abiʹathar the son of Ahimʹelech fled to David to Ke-iʹlah, he came down with an ephod in his hand.
7 Now it was told Saul that David had come to Ke-iʹlah. And Saul said, “God has given him into my hand; for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.”
8 And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Ke-iʹlah, to besiege David and his men.
9 David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; and he said to Abiʹathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”
10 Then said David, “OLord, the God of Israel, thy servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Ke-iʹlah, to destroy the city on my account.
11 Will the men of Ke-iʹlah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as thy servant has heard? OLord, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant.” And theLordsaid, “He will come down.”
12 Then said David, “Will the men of Ke-iʹlah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And theLordsaid, “They will surrender you.”
13 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Ke-iʹlah, and they went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Ke-iʹlah, he gave up the expedition.
14 And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.
### David Eludes Saul in the Wilderness
15 And David was afraid because Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.
16 And Jonathan, Saul’s son, rose, and went to David at Horesh, and strengthened his hand in God.
17 And he said to him, “Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; Saul my father also knows this.”
18 And the two of them made a covenant before theLord; David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.
19 Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibʹe-ah, saying, “Does not David hide among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachiʹlah, which is south of Jeshiʹmon?
20 Now come down, O king, according to all your heart’s desire to come down; and our part shall be to surrender him into the king’s hand.”
21 And Saul said, “May you be blessed by theLord; for you have had compassion on me.
22 Go, make yet more sure; know and see the place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for it is told me that he is very cunning.
23 See therefore, and take note of all the lurking places where he hides, and come back to me with sure information. Then I will go with you; and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”
24 And they arose, and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maʹon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshiʹmon.
25 And Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told; therefore he went down to the rock which is in the wilderness of Maʹon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maʹon.
26 Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain; and David was making haste to get away from Saul, as Saul and his men were closing in upon David and his men to capture them,
27 when a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Make haste and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.”
28 So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines; therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape.
29 And David went up from there, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-geʹdi.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 23 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et annuntiaverunt David, dicentes: Ecce Philisthiim oppugnant Ceilam et diripiunt areas.
2 Consuluit ergo David Dominum, dicens: Num vadam, et percutiam Philisthæos istos? Et ait Dominus ad David: Vade, et percuties Philisthæos, et Ceilam salvabis.
3 Et dixerunt viri qui erant cum David ad eum: Ecce nos hic in Judæa consistentes timemus: quanto magis si ierimus in Ceilam adversum agmina Philisthinorum?
4 Rursum ergo David consuluit Dominum. Qui respondens, ait ei: Surge, et vade in Ceilam: ego enim tradam Philisthæos in manu tua.
5 Abiit ergo David et viri ejus in Ceilam, et pugnavit adversum Philisthæos: et abegit jumenta eorum, et percussit eos plaga magna: et salvavit David habitatores Ceilæ.
6 Porro eo tempore quo fugiebat Abiathar filius Achimelech ad David in Ceilam, ephod secum habens descenderat.

7 Nuntiatum est autem Sauli quod venisset David in Ceilam: et ait Saul: Tradidit eum Deus in manus meas, conclususque est introgressus urbem, in qua portæ et seræ sunt.
8 Et præcepit Saul omni populo ut ad pugnam descenderet in Ceilam, et obsideret David et viros ejus.
9 Quod cum David rescisset quia præpararet ei Saul clam malum, dixit ad Abiathar sacerdotem: Applica ephod.
10 Et ait David: Domine Deus Israël, audivit famam servus tuus, quod disponat Saul venire in Ceilam, ut evertat urbem propter me:
11 si tradent me viri Ceilæ in manus ejus? et si descendet Saul, sicut audivit servus tuus? Domine Deus Israël, indica servo tuo. Et ait Dominus: Descendet.
12 Dixitque David: Si tradent me viri Ceilæ, et viros qui sunt mecum, in manus Saul? Et dixit Dominus: Tradent.
13 Surrexit ergo David et viri ejus quasi sexcenti, et egressi de Ceila, huc atque illuc vagabantur incerti: nuntiatumque est Sauli quod fugisset David de Ceila, et salvatus esset: quam ob rem dissimulavit exire.

14 Morabatur autem David in deserto in locis firmissimis, mansitque in monte solitudinis Ziph, in monte opaco: quærebat eum tamen Saul cunctis diebus, et non tradidit eum Deus in manus ejus.
15 Et vidit David quod egressus esset Saul ut quæreret animam ejus. Porro David erat in deserto Ziph in silva.
16 Et surrexit Jonathas filius Saul, et abiit ad David in silvam, et confortavit manus ejus in Deo: dixitque ei:
17 Ne timeas: neque enim inveniet te manus Saul patris mei, et tu regnabis super Israël, et ego ero tibi secundus: sed et Saul pater meus scit hoc.
18 Percussit ergo uterque fœdus coram Domino: mansitque David in silva, Jonathas autem reversus est in domum suam.

19 Ascenderunt autem Ziphæi ad Saul in Gabaa, dicentes: Nonne ecce David latitat apud nos in locis tutissimis silvæ, in colle Hachila, quæ est ad dexteram deserti?
20 Nunc ergo, sicut desideravit anima tua ut descenderes, descende: nostrum autem erit ut tradamus eum in manus regis.
21 Dixitque Saul: Benedicti vos a Domino, quia doluistis vicem meam.
22 Abite ergo, oro, et diligentius præparate, et curiosius agite, et considerate locum ubi sit pes ejus, vel quis viderit eum ibi: recogitat enim de me, quod callide insidier ei.
23 Considerate, et videte omnia latibula ejus in quibus absconditur: et revertimini ad me ad rem certam, ut vadam vobiscum. Quod si etiam in terram se abstruserit, perscrutabor eum in cunctis millibus Juda.

24 At illi surgentes abierunt in Ziph ante Saul: David autem et viri ejus erant in deserto Maon, in campestribus ad dexteram Jesimon.
25 Ivit ergo Saul et socii ejus ad quærendum eum. Et nuntiatum est David: statimque descendit ad petram, et versabatur in deserto Maon: quod cum audisset Saul, persecutus est David in deserto Maon.
26 Et ibat Saul ad latus montis ex parte una: David autem et viri ejus erant in latere montis ex parte altera. Porro David desperabat se posse evadere a facie Saul: itaque Saul et viri ejus in modum coronæ cingebant David et viros ejus, ut caperent eos.
27 Et nuntius venit ad Saul, dicens: Festina, et veni, quoniam infuderunt se Philisthiim super terram.
28 Reversus est ergo Saul desistens persequi David, et perrexit in occursum Philisthinorum: propter hoc vocaverunt locum illum, Petram dividentem.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 23 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Δαυιδ λέγοντες ἰδοὺ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι πολεμοῦσιν ἐν τῇ Κεϊλα καὶ αὐτοὶ διαρπάζουσιν καταπατοῦσιν τοὺς ἅλω
2 καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν Δαυιδ διὰ τοῦ κυρίου λέγων εἰ πορευθῶ καὶ πατάξω τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους τούτους καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πορεύου καὶ πατάξεις ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις τούτοις καὶ σώσεις τὴν Κεϊλα
3 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ Δαυιδ πρὸς αὐτόν ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς ἐνταῦθα ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ φοβούμεθα καὶ πῶς ἔσται ἐὰν πορευθῶμεν εἰς Κεϊλα εἰς τὰ σκῦλα τῶν ἀλλοφύλων εἰσπορευσόμεθα
4 καὶ προσέθετο Δαυιδ ἐρωτῆσαι ἔτι διὰ τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ κύριος καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν ἀνάστηθι καὶ κατάβηθι εἰς Κεϊλα ὅτι ἐγὼ παραδίδωμι τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους εἰς χεῖράς σου
5 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Δαυιδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἰς Κεϊλα καὶ ἐπολέμησεν ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις καὶ ἔφυγον ἐκ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπήγαγεν τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτοῖς πληγὴν μεγάλην καὶ ἔσωσεν Δαυιδ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Κεϊλα
6 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ φυγεῖν Αβιαθαρ υἱὸν Αβιμελεχ πρὸς Δαυιδ καὶ αὐτὸς μετὰ Δαυιδ εἰς Κεϊλα κατέβη ἔχων εφουδ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ

7 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαουλ ὅτι ἥκει Δαυιδ εἰς Κεϊλα καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ πέπρακεν αὐτὸν ὁ θεὸς εἰς χεῖράς μου ὅτι ἀποκέκλεισται εἰσελθὼν εἰς πόλιν θυρῶν καὶ μοχλῶν
8 καὶ παρήγγειλεν Σαουλ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ εἰς πόλεμον καταβαίνειν εἰς Κεϊλα συνέχειν τὸν Δαυιδ καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας αὐτοῦ
9 καὶ ἔγνω Δαυιδ ὅτι οὐ παρασιωπᾷ Σαουλ περὶ αὐτοῦ τὴν κακίαν καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Αβιαθαρ τὸν ἱερέα προσάγαγε τὸ εφουδ κυρίου
10 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἀκούων ἀκήκοεν ὁ δοῦλός σου ὅτι ζητεῖ Σαουλ ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ Κεϊλα διαφθεῖραι τὴν πόλιν δ{I'} ἐμέ
11 εἰ ἀποκλεισθήσεται καὶ νῦν εἰ καταβήσεται Σαουλ καθὼς ἤκουσεν ὁ δοῦλός σου κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἀπάγγειλον τῷ δούλῳ σου καὶ εἶπεν κύριος ἀποκλεισθήσεται
12 
13 καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυιδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ὡς τετρακόσιοι καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ Κεϊλα καὶ ἐπορεύοντο οὗ ἐὰν ἐπορεύθησαν καὶ τῷ Σαουλ ἀπηγγέλη ὅτι διασέσωται Δαυιδ ἐκ Κεϊλα καὶ ἀνῆκεν τοῦ ἐξελθεῖν

14 καὶ ἐκάθισεν Δαυιδ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐν Μασερεμ ἐν τοῖς στενοῖς καὶ ἐκάθητο ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Ζιφ ἐν τῇ γῇ τῇ αὐχμώδει καὶ ἐζήτει αὐτὸν Σαουλ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας καὶ οὐ παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν κύριος εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ εἶδεν Δαυιδ ὅτι ἐξέρχεται Σαουλ τοῦ ζητεῖν τὸν Δαυιδ καὶ Δαυιδ ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ αὐχμώδει ἐν τῇ Καινῇ Ζιφ
16 καὶ ἀνέστη Ιωναθαν υἱὸς Σαουλ καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς Δαυιδ εἰς Καινὴν καὶ ἐκραταίωσεν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐν κυρίῳ
17 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν μὴ φοβοῦ ὅτι οὐ μὴ εὕρῃ σε ἡ χεὶρ Σαουλ τοῦ πατρός μου καὶ σὺ βασιλεύσεις ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐγὼ ἔσομαί σοι εἰς δεύτερον καὶ Σαουλ ὁ πατήρ μου οἶδεν οὕτως
18 καὶ διέθεντο ἀμφότεροι διαθήκην ἐνώπιον κυρίου καὶ ἐκάθητο Δαυιδ ἐν Καινῇ καὶ Ιωναθαν ἀπῆλθεν εἰς οἶκον αὐτοῦ

19 καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ Ζιφαῖοι ἐκ τῆς αὐχμώδους πρὸς Σαουλ ἐπὶ τὸν βουνὸν λέγοντες οὐκ ἰδοὺ Δαυιδ κέκρυπται πα{R'} ἡμῖν ἐν Μεσσαρα ἐν τοῖς στενοῖς ἐν τῇ Καινῇ ἐν τῷ βουνῷ τοῦ Εχελα τοῦ ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ Ιεσσαιμουν
20 καὶ νῦν πᾶν τὸ πρὸς ψυχὴν τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς κατάβασιν καταβαινέτω πρὸς ἡμᾶς κεκλείκασιν αὐτὸν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ βασιλέως
21 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαουλ εὐλογημένοι ὑμεῖς τῷ κυρίῳ ὅτι ἐπονέσατε περὶ ἐμοῦ
22 πορεύθητε δὴ καὶ ἑτοιμάσατε ἔτι καὶ γνῶτε τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ οὗ ἔσται ὁ ποὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν τάχει ἐκεῖ οὗ εἴπατε μήποτε πανουργεύσηται
23 καὶ ἴδετε καὶ γνῶτε καὶ πορευσόμεθα με{Q'} ὑμῶν καὶ ἔσται εἰ ἔστιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐξερευνήσω αὐτὸν ἐν πάσαις χιλιάσιν Ιουδα

24 καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ Ζιφαῖοι καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἔμπροσθεν Σαουλ καὶ Δαυιδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τῇ Μααν κα{Q'} ἑσπέραν ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ Ιεσσαιμουν
25 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Σαουλ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ζητεῖν αὐτόν καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν τῷ Δαυιδ καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὴν πέτραν τὴν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Μααν καὶ ἤκουσεν Σαουλ καὶ κατεδίωξεν ὀπίσω Δαυιδ εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Μααν
26 καὶ πορεύονται Σαουλ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἐκ μέρους τοῦ ὄρους τούτου καὶ ἦν Δαυιδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἐκ μέρους τοῦ ὄρους τούτου καὶ ἦν Δαυιδ σκεπαζόμενος πορεύεσθαι ἀπὸ προσώπου Σαουλ καὶ Σαουλ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ Δαυιδ καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας αὐτοῦ συλλαβεῖν αὐτούς
27 καὶ ἄγγελος πρὸς Σαουλ ἦλθεν λέγων σπεῦδε καὶ δεῦρο ὅτι ἐπέθεντο οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
28 καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν Σαουλ μὴ καταδιώκειν ὀπίσω Δαυιδ καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς συνάντησιν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων διὰ τοῦτο ἐπεκλήθη ὁ τόπος ἐκεῖνος Πέτρα ἡ μερισθεῖσα
