# First Book of Samuel 22 (RSVCE)

### David and His Followers at Adulʹlam
1 David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him.
2 And every one who was in distress, and every one who was in debt, and every one who was discontented, gathered to him; and he became captain over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.
3 And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, “Pray let my father and my mother stay with you, till I know what God will do for me.”
4 And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
5 Then the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.” So David departed, and went into the forest of Hereth.
### Saul Slaughters the Priests at Nob
6 Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gibʹe-ah, under the tamarisk tree on the height, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.
7 And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, “Hear now, you Benjaminites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,
8 that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son of Jesse, none of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day.”
9 Then answered Doʹeg the Eʹdomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimʹelech the son of Ahiʹtub,
10 and he inquired of theLordfor him, and gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”
11 Then the king sent to summon Ahimʹelech the priest, the son of Ahiʹtub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were at Nob; and all of them came to the king.
12 And Saul said, “Hear now, son of Ahiʹtub.” And he answered, “Here I am, my lord.”
13 And Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?”
14 Then Ahimʹelech answered the king, “And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and captain over your bodyguard, and honored in your house?
15 Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father; for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little.”
16 And the king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimʹelech, you and all your father’s house.”
17 And the king said to the guard who stood about him, “Turn and kill the priests of theLord; because their hand also is with David, and they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of theLord.
18 Then the king said to Doʹeg, “You turn and fall upon the priests.” And Doʹeg the Eʹdomite turned and fell upon the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.
19 And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both men and women, children and sucklings, oxen, asses and sheep, he put to the sword.
20 But one of the sons of Ahimʹelech the son of Ahiʹtub, named Abiʹathar, escaped and fled after David.
21 And Abiʹathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of theLord.
22 And David said to Abiʹathar, “I knew on that day, when Doʹeg the Eʹdomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father’s house.
23 Stay with me, fear not; for he that seeks my life seeks your life; with me you shall be in safekeeping.”


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 22 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Abiit ergo David inde, et fugit in speluncam Odollam. Quod cum audissent fratres ejus, et omnis domus patris ejus, descenderunt ad eum illuc.
2 Et convenerunt ad eum omnes qui erant in angustia constituti, et oppressi ære alieno, et amaro animo: et factus est eorum princeps, fueruntque cum eo quasi quadringenti viri.
3 Et profectus est David inde in Maspha, quæ est Moab: et dixit ad regem Moab: Maneat, oro, pater meus et mater mea vobiscum, donec sciam quid faciat mihi Deus.
4 Et reliquit eos ante faciem regis Moab: manseruntque apud eum cunctis diebus quibus David fuit in præsidio.
5 Dixitque Gad propheta ad David: Noli manere in præsidio: proficiscere, et vade in terram Juda. Et profectus est David, et venit in saltum Haret.

6 Et audivit Saul quod apparuisset David, et viri qui erant cum eo. Saul autem cum maneret in Gabaa, et esset in nemore quod est in Rama, hastam manu tenens, cunctique servi ejus circumstarent eum,
7 ait ad servos suos qui assistebant ei: Audite nunc, filii Jemini: numquid omnibus vobis dabit filius Isai agros et vineas, et universos vos faciet tribunos et centuriones?
8 quoniam conjurastis omnes adversum me, et non est qui mihi renuntiet, maxime cum et filius meus fœdus inierit cum filio Isai. Non est qui vicem meam doleat ex vobis, nec qui annuntiet mihi: eo quod suscitaverit filius meus servum meum adversum me, insidiantem mihi usque hodie.
9 Respondens autem Doëg Idumæus, qui assistebat, et erat primus inter servos Saul: Vidi, inquit, filium Isai in Nobe apud Achimelech filium Achitob sacerdotem.
10 Qui consuluit pro eo Dominum, et cibaria dedit ei: sed et gladium Goliath Philisthæi dedit illi.

11 Misit ergo rex ad accersendum Achimelech sacerdotem filium Achitob, et omnem domum patris ejus, sacerdotum qui erant in Nobe, qui universi venerunt ad regem.
12 Et ait Saul ad Achimelech: Audi, fili Achitob. Qui respondit: Præsto sum, domine.
13 Dixitque ad eum Saul: Quare conjurastis adversum me, tu et filius Isai, et dedisti ei panes et gladium, et consuluisti pro eo Deum, ut consurgeret adversum me, insidiator usque hodie permanens?
14 Respondensque Achimelech regi, ait: Et quis in omnibus servis tuis sicut David, fidelis, et gener regis, et pergens ad imperium tuum, et gloriosus in domo tua?
15 num hodie cœpi pro eo consulere Deum? absit hoc a me: ne suspicetur rex adversus servum suum rem hujuscemodi, in universa domo patris mei: non enim scivit servus tuus quidquam super hoc negotio, vel modicum vel grande.
16 Dixitque rex: Morte morieris Achimelech, tu et omnis domus patris tui.
17 Et ait rex emissariis qui circumstabant eum: Convertimini, et interficite sacerdotes Domini, nam manus eorum cum David est: scientes quod fugisset, et non indicaverunt mihi. Noluerunt autem servi regis extendere manus suas in sacerdotes Domini.
18 Et ait rex ad Doëg: Convertere tu, et irrue in sacerdotes. Conversusque Doëg Idumæus, irruit in sacerdotes, et trucidavit in die illa octoginta quinque viros vestitos ephod lineo.
19 Nobe autem civitatem sacerdotum percussit in ore gladii, viros et mulieres, et parvulos et lactentes, bovemque, et asinum, et ovem in ore gladii.

20 Evadens autem unus filius Achimelech filii Achitob, cujus nomen erat Abiathar, fugit ad David,
21 et annuntiavit ei quod occidisset Saul sacerdotes Domini.
22 Et ait David ad Abiathar: Sciebam in die illa quod cum ibi esset Doëg Idumæus, procul dubio annuntiaret Sauli: ego sum reus omnium animarum patris tui.
23 Mane mecum: ne timeas: si quis quæsierit animam meam, quæret et animam tuam, mecumque servaberis.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 22 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκεῖθεν Δαυιδ καὶ διεσώθη καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον τὸ Οδολλαμ καὶ ἀκούουσιν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ καταβαίνουσιν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ
2 καὶ συνήγοντο πρὸς αὐτὸν πᾶς ἐν ἀνάγκῃ καὶ πᾶς ὑπόχρεως καὶ πᾶς κατώδυνος ψυχῇ καὶ ἦν ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν ἡγούμενος καὶ ἦσαν με{T'} αὐτοῦ ὡς τετρακόσιοι ἄνδρες
3 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Δαυιδ ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Μασσηφα τῆς Μωαβ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς βασιλέα Μωαβ γινέσθωσαν δὴ ὁ πατήρ μου καὶ ἡ μήτηρ μου παρὰ σοί ἕως ὅτου γνῶ τί ποιήσει μοι ὁ θεός
4 καὶ παρεκάλεσεν τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ βασιλέως Μωαβ καὶ κατῴκουν με{T'} αὐτοῦ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ὄντος τοῦ Δαυιδ ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ
5 καὶ εἶπεν Γαδ ὁ προφήτης πρὸς Δαυιδ μὴ κάθου ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ πορεύου καὶ ἥξεις εἰς γῆν Ιουδα καὶ ἐπορεύθη Δαυιδ καὶ ἦλθεν καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν πόλει Σαριχ

6 καὶ ἤκουσεν Σαουλ ὅτι ἔγνωσται Δαυιδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ Σαουλ ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ βουνῷ ὑπὸ τὴν ἄρουραν τὴν ἐν Ραμα καὶ τὸ δόρυ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ παρειστήκεισαν αὐτῷ
7 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ τοὺς παρεστηκότας αὐτῷ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἀκούσατε δή υἱοὶ Βενιαμιν εἰ ἀληθῶς πᾶσιν ὑμῖν δώσει ὁ υἱὸς Ιεσσαι ἀγροὺς καὶ ἀμπελῶνας καὶ πάντας ὑμᾶς τάξει ἑκατοντάρχους καὶ χιλιάρχους
8 ὅτι σύγκεισθε πάντες ὑμεῖς ἐ{P'} ἐμέ καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ ἀποκαλύπτων τὸ ὠτίον μου ἐν τῷ διαθέσθαι τὸν υἱόν μου διαθήκην μετὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ Ιεσσαι καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν πονῶν περὶ ἐμοῦ ἐξ ὑμῶν καὶ ἀποκαλύπτων τὸ ὠτίον μου ὅτι ἐπήγειρεν ὁ υἱός μου τὸν δοῦλόν μου ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ εἰς ἐχθρὸν ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη
9 καὶ ἀποκρίνεται Δωηκ ὁ Σύρος ὁ καθεστηκὼς ἐπὶ τὰς ἡμιόνους Σαουλ καὶ εἶπεν ἑόρακα τὸν υἱὸν Ιεσσαι παραγινόμενον εἰς Νομβα πρὸς Αβιμελεχ υἱὸν Αχιτωβ τὸν ἱερέα
10 καὶ ἠρώτα αὐτῷ διὰ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐπισιτισμὸν ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ καὶ τὴν ῥομφαίαν Γολιαδ τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ

11 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καλέσαι τὸν Αβιμελεχ υἱὸν Αχιτωβ καὶ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ τοὺς ἱερεῖς τοὺς ἐν Νομβα καὶ παρεγένοντο πάντες πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα
12 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ ἄκουε δή υἱὲ Αχιτωβ καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγώ λάλει κύριε
13 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Σαουλ ἵνα τί συνέθου κα{T'} ἐμοῦ σὺ καὶ ὁ υἱὸς Ιεσσαι δοῦναί σε αὐτῷ ἄρτον καὶ ῥομφαίαν καὶ ἐρωτᾶν αὐτῷ διὰ τοῦ θεοῦ θέσθαι αὐτὸν ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ εἰς ἐχθρὸν ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη
14 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ εἶπεν καὶ τίς ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς δούλοις σου ὡς Δαυιδ πιστὸς καὶ γαμβρὸς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἄρχων παντὸς παραγγέλματός σου καὶ ἔνδοξος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου
15 ἦ σήμερον ἦργμαι ἐρωτᾶν αὐτῷ διὰ τοῦ θεοῦ μηδαμῶς μὴ δότω ὁ βασιλεὺς κατὰ τοῦ δούλου αὐτοῦ λόγον καὶ ἐ{F'} ὅλον τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου ὅτι οὐκ ᾔδει ὁ δοῦλος ὁ σὸς ἐν πᾶσιν τούτοις ῥῆμα μικρὸν ἢ μέγα
16 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαουλ θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ Αβιμελεχ σὺ καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός σου
17 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῖς παρατρέχουσιν τοῖς ἐφεστηκόσιν ἐ{P'} αὐτόν προσαγάγετε καὶ θανατοῦτε τοὺς ἱερεῖς τοῦ κυρίου ὅτι ἡ χεὶρ αὐτῶν μετὰ Δαυιδ καὶ ὅτι ἔγνωσαν ὅτι φεύγει αὐτός καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκάλυψαν τὸ ὠτίον μου καὶ οὐκ ἐβουλήθησαν οἱ παῖδες τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπενεγκεῖν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἀπαντῆσαι εἰς τοὺς ἱερεῖς κυρίου
18 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Δωηκ ἐπιστρέφου σὺ καὶ ἀπάντα εἰς τοὺς ἱερεῖς καὶ ἐπεστράφη Δωηκ ὁ Σύρος καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν τοὺς ἱερεῖς κυρίου ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τριακοσίους καὶ πέντε ἄνδρας πάντας αἴροντας εφουδ
19 καὶ τὴν Νομβα τὴν πόλιν τῶν ἱερέων ἐπάταξεν ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς ἕως γυναικός ἀπὸ νηπίου ἕως θηλάζοντος καὶ μόσχου καὶ ὄνου καὶ προβάτου

20 καὶ διασῴζεται υἱὸς εἷς τῷ Αβιμελεχ υἱῷ Αχιτωβ καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Αβιαθαρ καὶ ἔφυγεν ὀπίσω Δαυιδ
21 καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν Αβιαθαρ τῷ Δαυιδ ὅτι ἐθανάτωσεν Σαουλ πάντας τοὺς ἱερεῖς τοῦ κυρίου
22 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ τῷ Αβιαθαρ ἤιδειν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ὅτι Δωηκ ὁ Σύρος ὅτι ἀπαγγέλλων ἀπαγγελεῖ τῷ Σαουλ ἐγώ εἰμι αἴτιος τῶν ψυχῶν οἴκου τοῦ πατρός σου
23 κάθου με{T'} ἐμοῦ μὴ φοβοῦ ὅτι οὗ ἐὰν ζητῶ τῇ ψυχῇ μου τόπον ζητήσω καὶ τῇ ψυχῇ σου ὅτι πεφύλαξαι σὺ πα{R'} ἐμοί
