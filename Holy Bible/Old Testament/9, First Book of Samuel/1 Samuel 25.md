# First Book of Samuel 25 (RSVCE)

### Death of Samuel
1 Now Samuel died; and all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him in his house at Ramah. Then David rose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
2 And there was a man in Maʹon, whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
3 Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abʹigail. The woman was of good understanding and beautiful, but the man was churlish and ill-behaved; he was a Caʹlebite.
4 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
5 So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.
6 And thus you shall salute him: ‘Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.
7 I hear that you have shearers; now your shepherds have been with us, and we did them no harm, and they missed nothing, all the time they were in Carmel.
8 Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes; for we come on a feast day. Pray, give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.’ ”
9 When David’s young men came, they said all this to Nabal in the name of David; and then they waited.
10 And Nabal answered David’s servants, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who are breaking away from their masters.
11 Shall I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who come from I do not know where?”
12 So David’s young men turned away, and came back and told him all this.
13 And David said to his men, “Every man gird on his sword!” And every man of them girded on his sword; David also girded on his sword; and about four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.
14 But one of the young men told Abʹigail, Nabal’s wife, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.
15 Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them;
16 they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
17 Now therefore know this and consider what you should do; for evil is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is so ill-natured that one cannot speak to him.”
18 Then Abʹigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two skins of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
19 And she said to her young men, “Go on before me; behold, I come after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
20 And as she rode on the ass, and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.
21 Now David had said, “Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him; and he has returned me evil for good.
22 God do so to David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him.”
23 When Abʹigail saw David, she made haste, and alighted from the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed to the ground.
24 She fell at his feet and said, “Upon me alone, my lord, be the guilt; pray let your handmaid speak in your ears, and hear the words of your handmaid.
25 Let not my lord regard this ill-natured fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I your handmaid did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.
26 Now then, my lord, as theLordlives, and as your soul lives, seeing theLordhas restrained you from bloodguilt, and from taking vengeance with your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal.
27 And now let this present which your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord.
28 Pray forgive the trespass of your handmaid; for theLordwill certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of theLord; and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live.
29 If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of theLordyour God; and the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.
30 And when theLordhas done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you prince over Israel,
31 my lord shall have no cause of grief, or pangs of conscience, for having shed blood without cause or for my lord taking vengeance himself. And when theLordhas dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.”
32 And David said to Abʹigail, “Blessed be theLord, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!
33 Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt and from avenging myself with my own hand!
34 For as surely as theLordthe God of Israel lives, who has restrained me from hurting you, unless you had made haste and come to meet me, truly by morning there had not been left to Nabal so much as one male.”
35 Then David received from her hand what she had brought him; and he said to her, “Go up in peace to your house; see, I have hearkened to your voice, and I have granted your petition.”
36 And Abʹigail came to Nabal; and lo, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; so she told him nothing at all until the morning light.
37 And in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
38 And about ten days later theLordsmote Nabal; and he died.
39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be theLordwho has avenged the insult I received at the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil; theLordhas returned the evil-doing of Nabal upon his own head.” Then David sent and wooed Abʹigail, to make her his wife.
40 And when the servants of David came to Abʹigail at Carmel, they said to her, “David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.”
41 And she rose and bowed with her face to the ground, and said, “Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”
42 And Abʹigail made haste and rose and mounted on an ass, and her five maidens attended her; she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
43 David also took Ahinʹo-am of Jezreʹel; and both of them became his wives.
44 Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laʹish, who was of Gallim.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 25 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Mortuus est autem Samuel, et congregatus est universus Israël, et planxerunt eum, et sepelierunt eum in domo sua in Ramatha. Consurgensque David descendit in desertum Pharan.

2 Erat autem vir quispiam in solitudine Maon, et possessio ejus in Carmelo, et homo ille magnus nimis: erantque ei oves tria millia, et mille capræ: et accidit ut tonderetur grex ejus in Carmelo.
3 Nomen autem viri illius erat Nabal. Et nomen uxoris ejus Abigail: eratque mulier illa prudentissima, et speciosa: porro vir ejus durus, et pessimus, et malitiosus: erat autem de genere Caleb.
4 Cum ergo audisset David in deserto quod tonderet Nabal gregem suum,
5 misit decem juvenes, et dixit eis: Ascendite in Carmelum, et venietis ad Nabal, et salutabitis eum ex nomine meo pacifice.
6 Et dicetis: Sit fratribus meis et tibi pax, et domui tuæ pax, et omnibus, quæcumque habes, sit pax.
7 Audivi quod tonderent pastores tui, qui erant nobiscum in deserto: numquam eis molesti fuimus, nec aliquando defuit quidquam eis de grege, omni tempore quo fuerunt nobiscum in Carmelo.
8 Interroga pueros tuos, et indicabunt tibi. Nunc ergo inveniant pueri tui gratiam in oculis tuis: in die enim bona venimus: quodcumque invenerit manus tua, da servis tuis, et filio tuo David.

9 Cumque venissent pueri David, locuti sunt ad Nabal omnia verba hæc ex nomine David: et siluerunt.
10 Respondens autem Nabal pueris David, ait: Quis est David? et quis est filius Isai? hodie increverunt servi qui fugiunt dominos suos.
11 Tollam ergo panes meos, et aquas meas, et carnes pecorum quæ occidi tonsoribus meis, et dabo viris quos nescio unde sint?
12 Regressi sunt itaque pueri David per viam suam, et reversi venerunt, et nuntiaverunt ei omnia verba quæ dixerat.
13 Tunc ait David pueris suis: Accingatur unusquisque gladio suo. Et accincti sunt singuli gladiis suis, accinctusque est et David ense suo: et secuti sunt David quasi quadringenti viri: porro ducenti remanserunt ad sarcinas.

14 Abigail autem uxori Nabal nuntiavit unus de pueris suis, dicens: Ecce David misit nuntios de deserto, ut benedicerent domino nostro: et aversatus est eos.
15 Homines isti boni satis fuerant nobis, et non molesti: nec quidquam aliquando periit omni tempore quo fuimus conversati cum eis in deserto:
16 pro muro erant nobis tam in nocte quam in die, omnibus diebus quibus pavimus apud eos greges.
17 Quam ob rem considera, et recogita quid facias: quoniam completa est malitia adversum virum tuum, et adversum domum tuam, et ipse est filius Belial, ita ut nemo possit ei loqui.
18 Festinavit igitur Abigail, et tulit ducentos panes, et duos utres vini, et quinque arietes coctos, et quinque sata polentæ, et centum ligaturas uvæ passæ, et ducentas massas caricarum, et posuit super asinos:
19 dixitque pueris suis: Præcedite me: ecce ego post tergum sequar vos: viro autem suo Nabal non indicavit.

20 Cum ergo ascendisset asinum, et descenderet ad radices montis, David et viri ejus descendebant in occursum ejus: quibus et illa occurrit.
21 Et ait David: Vere frustra servavi omnia quæ hujus erant in deserto, et non periit quidquam de cunctis quæ ad eum pertinebant: et reddidit mihi malum pro bono.
22 Hæc faciat Deus inimicis David, et hæc addat, si reliquero de omnibus quæ ad ipsum pertinent usque mane mingentem ad parietem.
23 Cum autem vidisset Abigail David, festinavit, et descendit de asino, et procidit coram David super faciem suam, et adoravit super terram,
24 et cecidit ad pedes ejus, et dixit: In me sit, domine mi, hæc iniquitas: loquatur, obsecro, ancilla tua in auribus tuis, et audi verba famulæ tuæ.
25 Ne ponat, oro, dominus meus rex cor suum super virum istum iniquum Nabal: quoniam secundum nomen suum stultus est, et stultitia est cum eo: ego autem ancilla tua non vidi pueros tuos, domine mi, quos misisti.
26 Nunc ergo, domine mi, vivit Dominus, et vivit anima tua, qui prohibuit te ne venires in sanguinem, et salvavit manum tuam tibi: et nunc fiant sicut Nabal inimici tui, et qui quærunt domino meo malum.
27 Quapropter suscipe benedictionem hanc, quam attulit ancilla tua tibi domino meo, et da pueris qui sequuntur te dominum meum.
28 Aufer iniquitatem famulæ tuæ: faciens enim faciet Dominus tibi domino meo domum fidelem, quia prælia Domini, domine mi, tu præliaris: malitia ergo non inveniatur in te omnibus diebus vitæ tuæ.
29 Si enim surrexerit aliquando homo persequens te, et quærens animam tuam, erit anima domini mei custodita quasi in fasciculo viventium apud Dominum Deum tuum: porro inimicorum tuorum anima rotabitur, quasi in impetu et circulo fundæ.
30 Cum ergo fecerit Dominus tibi domino meo omnia quæ locutus est bona de te, et constituerit te ducem super Israël,
31 non erit tibi hoc in singultum, et in scrupulum cordis domino meo, quod effuderis sanguinem innoxium, aut ipse te ultus fueris: et cum benefecerit Dominus domino meo, recordaberis ancillæ tuæ.

32 Et ait David ad Abigail: Benedictus Dominus Deus Israël, qui misit hodie te in occursum meum, et benedictum eloquium tuum,
33 et benedicta tu, quæ prohibuisti me hodie ne irem ad sanguinem, et ulciscerer me manu mea.
34 Alioquin vivit Dominus Deus Israël, qui prohibuit me ne malum facerem tibi: nisi cito venisses in occursum mihi, non remansisset Nabal usque ad lucem matutinam mingens ad parietem.
35 Suscepit ergo David de manu ejus omnia quæ attulerat ei, dixitque ei: Vade pacifice in domum tuam: ecce audivi vocem tuam, et honoravi faciem tuam.

36 Venit autem Abigail ad Nabal: et ecce erat ei convivium in domo ejus quasi convivium regis, et cor Nabal jucundum: erat enim ebrius nimis: et non indicavit ei verbum pusillum aut grande usque mane.
37 Diluculo autem cum digessisset vinum Nabal, indicavit ei uxor sua verba hæc: et emortuum est cor ejus intrinsecus, et factus est quasi lapis.
38 Cumque pertransissent decem dies, percussit Dominus Nabal, et mortuus est.
39 Quod cum audisset David mortuum Nabal, ait: Benedictus Dominus, qui judicavit causam opprobrii mei de manu Nabal, et servum suum custodivit a malo, et malitiam Nabal reddidit Dominus in caput ejus. Misit ergo David, et locutus est ad Abigail, ut sumeret eam sibi in uxorem.
40 Et venerunt pueri David ad Abigail in Carmelum, et locuti sunt ad eam, dicentes: David misit nos ad te, ut accipiat te sibi in uxorem.
41 Quæ consurgens, adoravit prona in terram, et ait: Ecce famula tua sit in ancillam, ut lavet pedes servorum domini mei.
42 Et festinavit, et surrexit Abigail, et ascendit super asinum, et quinque puellæ ierunt cum ea, pedissequæ ejus, et secuta est nuntios David: et facta est illi uxor.

43 Sed et Achinoam accepit David de Jezraël: et fuit utraque uxor ejus.
44 Saul autem dedit Michol filiam suam, uxorem David, Phalti filio Lais, qui erat de Gallim.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 25 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἀπέθανεν Σαμουηλ καὶ συναθροίζονται πᾶς Ισραηλ καὶ κόπτονται αὐτὸν καὶ θάπτουσιν αὐτὸν ἐν οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ ἐν Αρμαθαιμ καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυιδ καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Μααν

2 καὶ ἦν ἄνθρωπος ἐν τῇ Μααν καὶ τὰ ποίμνια αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ Καρμήλῳ καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος μέγας σφόδρα καὶ τούτῳ ποίμνια τρισχίλια καὶ αἶγες χίλιαι καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ κείρειν τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ Καρμήλῳ
3 καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ Ναβαλ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ Αβιγαια καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἀγαθὴ συνέσει καὶ καλὴ τῷ εἴδει σφόδρα καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος σκληρὸς καὶ πονηρὸς ἐν ἐπιτηδεύμασιν καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος κυνικός
4 καὶ ἤκουσεν Δαυιδ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ὅτι κείρει Ναβαλ ὁ Καρμήλιος τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ
5 καὶ Δαυιδ ἀπέστειλεν δέκα παιδάρια καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς παιδαρίοις ἀνάβητε εἰς Κάρμηλον καὶ ἀπέλθατε πρὸς Ναβαλ καὶ ἐρωτήσατε αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου εἰς εἰρήνην
6 καὶ ἐρεῖτε τάδε εἰς ὥρας καὶ σὺ ὑγιαίνων καὶ ὁ οἶκός σου καὶ πάντα τὰ σὰ ὑγιαίνοντα
7 καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἀκήκοα ὅτι κείρουσίν σοι νῦν οἱ ποιμένες σου οἳ ἦσαν με{Q'} ἡμῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκωλύσαμεν αὐτοὺς καὶ οὐκ ἐνετειλάμεθα αὐτοῖς οὐθὲν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ὄντων αὐτῶν ἐν Καρμήλῳ
8 ἐρώτησον τὰ παιδάριά σου καὶ ἀπαγγελοῦσίν σοι καὶ εὑρέτωσαν τὰ παιδάρια χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου ὅτι ἐ{F'} ἡμέραν ἀγαθὴν ἥκομεν δὸς δὴ ὃ ἐὰν εὕρῃ ἡ χείρ σου τῷ υἱῷ σου τῷ Δαυιδ

9 καὶ ἔρχονται τὰ παιδάρια καὶ λαλοῦσιν τοὺς λόγους τούτους πρὸς Ναβαλ κατὰ πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Δαυιδ καὶ ἀνεπήδησεν
10 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ναβαλ τοῖς παισὶν Δαυιδ καὶ εἶπεν τίς ὁ Δαυιδ καὶ τίς ὁ υἱὸς Ιεσσαι σήμερον πεπληθυμμένοι εἰσὶν οἱ δοῦλοι ἀναχωροῦντες ἕκαστος ἐκ προσώπου τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ
11 καὶ λήμψομαι τοὺς ἄρτους μου καὶ τὸν οἶνόν μου καὶ τὰ θύματά μου ἃ τέθυκα τοῖς κείρουσίν μου τὰ πρόβατα καὶ δώσω αὐτὰ ἀνδράσιν οἷς οὐκ οἶδα πόθεν εἰσίν
12 καὶ ἀπεστράφησαν τὰ παιδάρια Δαυιδ εἰς ὁδὸν αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν καὶ ἦλθον καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ Δαυιδ κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα
13 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ τοῖς ἀνδράσιν αὐτοῦ ζώσασθε ἕκαστος τὴν ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέβησαν ὀπίσω Δαυιδ ὡς τετρακόσιοι ἄνδρες καὶ οἱ διακόσιοι ἐκάθισαν μετὰ τῶν σκευῶν

14 καὶ τῇ Αβιγαια γυναικὶ Ναβαλ ἀπήγγειλεν ἓν τῶν παιδαρίων λέγων ἰδοὺ Δαυιδ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους ἐκ τῆς ἐρήμου εὐλογῆσαι τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν καὶ ἐξέκλινεν ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν
15 καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες ἀγαθοὶ ἡμῖν σφόδρα οὐκ ἀπεκώλυσαν ἡμᾶς οὐδὲ ἐνετείλαντο ἡμῖν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ἦμεν πα{R'} αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐν τῷ εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἐν ἀγρῷ
16 ὡς τεῖχος ἦσαν περὶ ἡμᾶς καὶ τὴν νύκτα καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ἤμεθα πα{R'} αὐτοῖς ποιμαίνοντες τὸ ποίμνιον
17 καὶ νῦν γνῶθι καὶ ἰδὲ τί σὺ ποιήσεις ὅτι συντετέλεσται ἡ κακία εἰς τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν καὶ εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ οὗτος υἱὸς λοιμός καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν λαλῆσαι πρὸς αὐτόν
18 καὶ ἔσπευσεν Αβιγαια καὶ ἔλαβεν διακοσίους ἄρτους καὶ δύο ἀγγεῖα οἴνου καὶ πέντε πρόβατα πεποιημένα καὶ πέντε οιφι ἀλφίτου καὶ γομορ ἓν σταφίδος καὶ διακοσίας παλάθας καὶ ἔθετο ἐπὶ τοὺς ὄνους
19 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς παιδαρίοις αὐτῆς προπορεύεσθε ἔμπροσθέν μου καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ὀπίσω ὑμῶν παραγίνομαι καὶ τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν

20 καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῆς ἐπιβεβηκυίης ἐπὶ τὴν ὄνον καὶ καταβαινούσης ἐν σκέπῃ τοῦ ὄρους καὶ ἰδοὺ Δαυιδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ κατέβαινον εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῆς καὶ ἀπήντησεν αὐτοῖς
21 καὶ Δαυιδ εἶπεν ἴσως εἰς ἄδικον πεφύλακα πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ καὶ οὐκ ἐνετειλάμεθα λαβεῖν ἐκ πάντων τῶν αὐτοῦ οὐθέν καὶ ἀνταπέδωκέν μοι πονηρὰ ἀντὶ ἀγαθῶν
22 τάδε ποιήσαι ὁ θεὸς τῷ Δαυιδ καὶ τάδε προσθείη εἰ ὑπολείψομαι ἐκ πάντων τῶν τοῦ Ναβαλ ἕως πρωὶ οὐροῦντα πρὸς τοῖχον
23 καὶ εἶδεν Αβιγαια τὸν Δαυιδ καὶ ἔσπευσεν καὶ κατεπήδησεν ἀπὸ τῆς ὄνου καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐνώπιον Δαυιδ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
24 ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ἐν ἐμοί κύριέ μου ἡ ἀδικία λαλησάτω δὴ ἡ δούλη σου εἰς τὰ ὦτά σου καὶ ἄκουσον τῆς δούλης σου λόγον
25 μὴ δὴ θέσθω ὁ κύριός μου καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον τὸν λοιμὸν τοῦτον ὅτι κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ οὕτως ἐστίν Ναβαλ ὄνομα αὐτῷ καὶ ἀφροσύνη με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγὼ ἡ δούλη σου οὐκ εἶδον τὰ παιδάριά σου ἃ ἀπέστειλας
26 καὶ νῦν κύριε ζῇ κύριος καὶ ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου καθὼς ἐκώλυσέν σε κύριος τοῦ μὴ ἐλθεῖν εἰς αἷμα ἀθῷον καὶ σῴζειν τὴν χεῖρά σού σοι καὶ νῦν γένοιντο ὡς Ναβαλ οἱ ἐχθροί σου καὶ οἱ ζητοῦντες τῷ κυρίῳ μου κακά
27 καὶ νῦν λαβὲ τὴν εὐλογίαν ταύτην ἣν ἐνήνοχεν ἡ δούλη σου τῷ κυρίῳ μου καὶ δώσεις τοῖς παιδαρίοις τοῖς παρεστηκόσιν τῷ κυρίῳ μου
28 ἆρον δὴ τὸ ἀνόμημα τῆς δούλης σου ὅτι ποιῶν ποιήσει κύριος τῷ κυρίῳ μου οἶκον πιστόν ὅτι πόλεμον κυρίου ὁ κύριός μου πολεμεῖ καὶ κακία οὐχ εὑρεθήσεται ἐν σοὶ πώποτε
29 καὶ ἀναστήσεται ἄνθρωπος καταδιώκων σε καὶ ζητῶν τὴν ψυχήν σου καὶ ἔσται ἡ ψυχὴ κυρίου μου ἐνδεδεμένη ἐν δεσμῷ τῆς ζωῆς παρὰ κυρίῳ τῷ θεῷ καὶ ψυχὴν ἐχθρῶν σου σφενδονήσεις ἐν μέσῳ τῆς σφενδόνης
30 καὶ ἔσται ὅτι ποιήσει κύριος τῷ κυρίῳ μου πάντα ὅσα ἐλάλησεν ἀγαθὰ ἐπὶ σέ καὶ ἐντελεῖταί σοι κύριος εἰς ἡγούμενον ἐπὶ Ισραηλ
31 καὶ οὐκ ἔσται σοι τοῦτο βδελυγμὸς καὶ σκάνδαλον τῷ κυρίῳ μου ἐκχέαι αἷμα ἀθῷον δωρεὰν καὶ σῶσαι χεῖρα κυρίου μου αὐτῷ καὶ ἀγαθώσει κύριος τῷ κυρίῳ μου καὶ μνησθήσῃ τῆς δούλης σου ἀγαθῶσαι αὐτῇ

32 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ τῇ Αβιγαια εὐλογητὸς κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ὃς ἀπέστειλέν σε σήμερον ἐν ταύτῃ εἰς ἀπάντησίν μου
33 καὶ εὐλογητὸς ὁ τρόπος σου καὶ εὐλογημένη σὺ ἡ ἀποκωλύσασά με σήμερον ἐν ταύτῃ μὴ ἐλθεῖν εἰς αἵματα καὶ σῶσαι χεῖρά μου ἐμοί
34 πλὴν ὅτι ζῇ κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ὃς ἀπεκώλυσέν με σήμερον τοῦ κακοποιῆσαί σε ὅτι εἰ μὴ ἔσπευσας καὶ παρεγένου εἰς ἀπάντησίν μοι τότε εἶπα εἰ ὑπολειφθήσεται τῷ Ναβαλ ἕως φωτὸς τοῦ πρωὶ οὐρῶν πρὸς τοῖχον
35 καὶ ἔλαβεν Δαυιδ ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῆς πάντα ἃ ἔφερεν αὐτῷ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ἀνάβηθι εἰς εἰρήνην εἰς οἶκόν σου βλέπε ἤκουσα τῆς φωνῆς σου καὶ ᾑρέτισα τὸ πρόσωπόν σου

36 καὶ παρεγενήθη Αβιγαια πρὸς Ναβαλ καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτῷ πότος ἐν οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ ὡς πότος βασιλέως καὶ ἡ καρδία Ναβαλ ἀγαθὴ ἐ{P'} αὐτόν καὶ αὐτὸς μεθύων ἕως σφόδρα καὶ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ ῥῆμα μικρὸν ἢ μέγα ἕως φωτὸς τοῦ πρωί
37 καὶ ἐγένετο πρωί ὡς ἐξένηψεν ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου Ναβαλ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα καὶ ἐναπέθανεν ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ αὐτὸς γίνεται ὡς λίθος
38 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡσεὶ δέκα ἡμέραι καὶ ἐπάταξεν κύριος τὸν Ναβαλ καὶ ἀπέθανεν
39 καὶ ἤκουσεν Δαυιδ καὶ εἶπεν εὐλογητὸς κύριος ὃς ἔκρινεν τὴν κρίσιν τοῦ ὀνειδισμοῦ μου ἐκ χειρὸς Ναβαλ καὶ τὸν δοῦλον αὐτοῦ περιεποιήσατο ἐκ χειρὸς κακῶν καὶ τὴν κακίαν Ναβαλ ἀπέστρεψεν κύριος εἰς κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δαυιδ καὶ ἐλάλησεν περὶ Αβιγαιας λαβεῖν αὐτὴν ἑαυτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα
40 καὶ ἦλθον οἱ παῖδες Δαυιδ πρὸς Αβιγαιαν εἰς Κάρμηλον καὶ ἐλάλησαν αὐτῇ λέγοντες Δαυιδ ἀπέστειλεν ἡμᾶς πρὸς σὲ λαβεῖν σε αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα
41 καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἡ δούλη σου εἰς παιδίσκην νίψαι πόδας τῶν παίδων σου
42 καὶ ἀνέστη Αβιγαια καὶ ἐπέβη ἐπὶ τὴν ὄνον καὶ πέντε κοράσια ἠκολούθουν αὐτῇ καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω τῶν παίδων Δαυιδ καὶ γίνεται αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα

43 καὶ τὴν Αχινααμ ἔλαβεν Δαυιδ ἐξ Ιεζραελ καὶ ἀμφότεραι ἦσαν αὐτῷ γυναῖκες
44 καὶ Σαουλ ἔδωκεν Μελχολ τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ τὴν γυναῖκα Δαυιδ τῷ Φαλτι υἱῷ Λαις τῷ ἐκ Ρομμα
