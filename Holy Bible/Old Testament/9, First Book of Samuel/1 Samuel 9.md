# First Book of Samuel 9 (RSVCE)

### Saul Chosen to Be King
1 There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiʹel, son of Zeror, son of Becoʹrath, son of Aphiʹah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth;
2 and he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he; from his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.
3 Now the asses of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. So Kish said to Saul his son, “Take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the asses.”
4 And they passed through the hill country of Eʹphraim and passed through the land of Shalʹishah, but they did not find them. And they passed through the land of Shaʹalim, but they were not there. Then they passed through the land of Benjamin, but did not find them.
5 When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us go back, lest my father cease to care about the asses and become anxious about us.”
6 But he said to him, “Behold, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he says comes true. Let us go there; perhaps he can tell us about the journey on which we have set out.”
7 Then Saul said to his servant, “But if we go, what can we bring the man? For the bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What have we?”
8 The servant answered Saul again, “Here, I have with me the fourth part of a shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God, to tell us our way.”
9 (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, “Come, let us go to the seer”; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)
10 And Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.
11 As they went up the hill to the city, they met young maidens coming out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”
12 They answered, “He is; behold, he is just ahead of you. Make haste; he has come just now to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.
13 As soon as you enter the city, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat till he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those eat who are invited. Now go up, for you will meet him immediately.”
14 So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.
15 Now the day before Saul came, theLordhad revealed to Samuel:
16 “Tomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He shall save my people from the hand of Philistines; for I have seen the affliction of my people, because their cry has come to me.”
17 When Samuel saw Saul, theLordtold him, “Here is the man of whom I spoke to you! He it is who shall rule over my people.”
18 Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate, and said, “Tell me where is the house of the seer?”
19 Samuel answered Saul, “I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for today you shall eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind.
20 As for your asses that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father’s house?”
21 Saul answered, “Am I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my family the humblest of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?”
22 Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited, who were about thirty persons.
23 And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Put it aside.’ ”
24 So the cook took up the leg and the upper portion and set them before Saul; and Samuel said, “See, what was kept is set before you. Eat; because it was kept for you until the hour appointed, that you might eat with the guests.” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
25 And when they came down from the high place into the city, a bed was spread for Saul upon the roof, and he lay down to sleep.
26 Then at the break of dawn Samuel called to Saul upon the roof, “Up, that I may send you on your way.” So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.
### Samuel Anoints Saul
27 As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to pass on before us, and when he has passed on stop here yourself for a while, that I may make known to you the word of God.”


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 9 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et erat vir de Benjamin nomine Cis, filius Abiel, filii Seror, filii Bechorath, filii Aphia, filii viri Jemini, fortis robore.
2 Et erat ei filius vocabulo Saul, electus et bonus: et non erat vir de filiis Israël melior illo: ab humero et sursum eminebat super omnem populum.
3 Perierant autem asinæ Cis patris Saul: et dixit Cis ad Saul filium suum: Tolle tecum unum de pueris, et consurgens vade, et quære asinas. Qui cum transissent per montem Ephraim
4 et per terram Salisa, et non invenissent, transierunt etiam per terram Salim, et non erant: sed et per terram Jemini, et minime repererunt.
5 Cum autem venissent in terram Suph, dixit Saul ad puerum qui erat cum eo: Veni et revertamur, ne forte dimiserit pater meus asinas, et sollicitus sit pro nobis.
6 Qui ait ei: Ecce vir Dei est in civitate hac, vir nobilis: omne quod loquitur, sine ambiguitate venit. Nunc ergo eamus illuc, si forte indicet nobis de via nostra, propter quam venimus.
7 Dixitque Saul ad puerum suum: Ecce ibimus: quid feremus ad virum Dei? panis defecit in sitarciis nostris, et sportulam non habemus ut demus homini Dei, nec quidquam aliud.
8 Rursum puer respondit Sauli, et ait: Ecce inventa est in manu mea quarta pars stateris argenti: demus homini Dei, ut indicet nobis viam nostram.
9 (Olim in Israël sic loquebatur unusquisque vadens consulere Deum: Venite, et eamus ad videntem. Qui enim propheta dicitur hodie, vocabatur olim videns.)
10 Et dixit Saul ad puerum suum: Optimus sermo tuus. Veni, eamus. Et ierunt in civitatem in qua erat vir Dei.
11 Cumque ascenderent clivum civitatis, invenerunt puellas egredientes ad hauriendam aquam, et dixerunt eis: Num hic est videns?
12 Quæ respondentes, dixerunt illis: Hic est: ecce ante te, festina nunc: hodie enim venit in civitatem, quia sacrificium est hodie populi in excelso.
13 Ingredientes urbem, statim invenietis eum antequam ascendat excelsum ad vescendum, neque enim comesurus est populus donec ille veniat: quia ipse benedicit hostiæ, et deinceps comedunt qui vocati sunt. Nunc ergo conscendite, quia hodie reperietis eum.
14 Et ascenderunt in civitatem. Cumque illi ambularent in medio urbis, apparuit Samuel egrediens obviam eis, ut ascenderet in excelsum.

15 Dominus autem revelaverat auriculam Samuelis ante unam diem quam veniret Saul, dicens:
16 Hac ipsa hora quæ nunc est, cras mittam virum ad te de terra Benjamin, et unges eum ducem super populum meum Israël: et salvabit populum meum de manu Philisthinorum, quia respexi populum meum: venit enim clamor eorum ad me.
17 Cumque aspexisset Samuel Saulem, Dominus dixit ei: Ecce vir quem dixeram tibi: iste dominabitur populo meo.

18 Accessit autem Saul ad Samuelem in medio portæ, et ait: Indica, oro, mihi, ubi est domus videntis.
19 Et respondit Samuel Sauli, dicens: Ego sum videns: ascende ante me in excelsum, ut comedatis mecum hodie, et dimittam te mane: et omnia quæ sunt in corde tuo indicabo tibi.
20 Et de asinis quas nudiustertius perdidisti, ne sollicitus sis, quia inventæ sunt. Et cujus erunt optima quæque Israël? nonne tibi et omni domui patris tui?
21 Respondens autem Saul, ait: Numquid non filius Jemini ego sum de minima tribu Israël, et cognatio mea novissima inter omnes familias de tribu Benjamin? quare ergo locutus es mihi sermonem istum?

22 Assumens itaque Samuel Saulem et puerum ejus, introduxit eos in triclinium, et dedit eis locum in capite eorum qui fuerant invitati: erant enim quasi triginta viri.
23 Dixitque Samuel coco: Da partem quam dedi tibi, et præcepi ut reponeres seorsum apud te.
24 Levavit autem cocus armum, et posuit ante Saul. Dixitque Samuel: Ecce quod remansit: pone ante te, et comede, quia de industria servatum est tibi quando populum vocavi. Et comedit Saul cum Samuele in die illa.
25 Et descenderunt de excelso in oppidum, et locutus est cum Saule in solario: stravitque Saul in solario, et dormivit.
26 Cumque mane surrexissent, et jam elucesceret, vocavit Samuel Saulem in solario, dicens: Surge, et dimittam te. Et surrexit Saul: egressique sunt ambo, ipse videlicet, et Samuel.
27 Cumque descenderent in extrema parte civitatis, Samuel dixit ad Saul: Dic puero ut antecedat nos et transeat: tu autem subsiste paulisper, ut indicem tibi verbum Domini.


# Βασιλειῶν Αʹ 9 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἦν ἀνὴρ ἐξ υἱῶν Βενιαμιν καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Κις υἱὸς Αβιηλ υἱοῦ Σαρεδ υἱοῦ Βαχιρ υἱοῦ Αφεκ υἱοῦ ἀνδρὸς Ιεμιναίου ἀνὴρ δυνατός
2 καὶ τούτῳ υἱός καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Σαουλ εὐμεγέθης ἀνὴρ ἀγαθός καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν υἱοῖς Ισραηλ ἀγαθὸς ὑπὲρ αὐτόν ὑπὲρ ὠμίαν καὶ ἐπάνω ὑψηλὸς ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν
3 καὶ ἀπώλοντο αἱ ὄνοι Κις πατρὸς Σαουλ καὶ εἶπεν Κις πρὸς Σαουλ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ λαβὲ μετὰ σεαυτοῦ ἓν τῶν παιδαρίων καὶ ἀνάστητε καὶ πορεύθητε καὶ ζητήσατε τὰς ὄνους
4 καὶ διῆλθον δ{I'} ὄρους Εφραιμ καὶ διῆλθον διὰ τῆς γῆς Σελχα καὶ οὐχ εὗρον καὶ διῆλθον διὰ τῆς γῆς Εασακεμ καὶ οὐκ ἦν καὶ διῆλθον διὰ τῆς γῆς Ιακιμ καὶ οὐχ εὗρον
5 αὐτῶν ἐλθόντων εἰς τὴν Σιφ καὶ Σαουλ εἶπεν τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὐτοῦ τῷ με{T'} αὐτοῦ δεῦρο καὶ ἀναστρέψωμεν μὴ ἀνεὶς ὁ πατήρ μου τὰς ὄνους φροντίζῃ περὶ ἡμῶν
6 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τὸ παιδάριον ἰδοὺ δὴ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἔνδοξος πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν λαλήσῃ παραγινόμενον παρέσται καὶ νῦν πορευθῶμεν ὅπως ἀπαγγείλῃ ἡμῖν τὴν ὁδὸν ἡμῶν ἐ{F'} ἣν ἐπορεύθημεν ἐ{P'} αὐτήν
7 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὐτοῦ τῷ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἰδοὺ πορευσόμεθα καὶ τί οἴσομεν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ θεοῦ ὅτι οἱ ἄρτοι ἐκλελοίπασιν ἐκ τῶν ἀγγείων ἡμῶν καὶ πλεῖον οὐκ ἔστιν με{Q'} ἡμῶν εἰσενεγκεῖν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ θεοῦ τὸ ὑπάρχον ἡμῖν
8 καὶ προσέθετο τὸ παιδάριον ἀποκριθῆναι τῷ Σαουλ καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ εὕρηται ἐν τῇ χειρί μου τέταρτον σίκλου ἀργυρίου καὶ δώσεις τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἀπαγγελεῖ ἡμῖν τὴν ὁδὸν ἡμῶν
9 καὶ ἔμπροσθεν ἐν Ισραηλ τάδε ἔλεγεν ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι ἐπερωτᾶν τὸν θεόν δεῦρο πορευθῶμεν πρὸς τὸν βλέποντα ὅτι τὸν προφήτην ἐκάλει ὁ λαὸς ἔμπροσθεν ὁ βλέπων
10 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ ἀγαθὸν τὸ ῥῆμα δεῦρο καὶ πορευθῶμεν καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς τὴν πόλιν οὗ ἦν ἐκεῖ ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ
11 αὐτῶν ἀναβαινόντων τὴν ἀνάβασιν τῆς πόλεως καὶ αὐτοὶ εὑρίσκουσιν τὰ κοράσια ἐξεληλυθότα ὑδρεύσασθαι ὕδωρ καὶ λέγουσιν αὐταῖς εἰ ἔστιν ἐνταῦθα ὁ βλέπων
12 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη τὰ κοράσια αὐτοῖς καὶ λέγουσιν αὐτοῖς ἔστιν ἰδοὺ κατὰ πρόσωπον ὑμῶν νῦν διὰ τὴν ἡμέραν ἥκει εἰς τὴν πόλιν ὅτι θυσία σήμερον τῷ λαῷ ἐν Βαμα
13 ὡς ἂν εἰσέλθητε τὴν πόλιν οὕτως εὑρήσετε αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ πόλει πρὶν ἀναβῆναι αὐτὸν εἰς Βαμα τοῦ φαγεῖν ὅτι οὐ μὴ φάγῃ ὁ λαὸς ἕως τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν αὐτόν ὅτι οὗτος εὐλογεῖ τὴν θυσίαν καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐσθίουσιν οἱ ξένοι καὶ νῦν ἀνάβητε ὅτι διὰ τὴν ἡμέραν εὑρήσετε αὐτόν
14 καὶ ἀναβαίνουσιν τὴν πόλιν αὐτῶν εἰσπορευομένων εἰς μέσον τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἰδοὺ Σαμουηλ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῶν τοῦ ἀναβῆναι εἰς Βαμα

15 καὶ κύριος ἀπεκάλυψεν τὸ ὠτίον Σαμουηλ ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ ἐλθεῖν πρὸς αὐτὸν Σαουλ λέγων
16 ὡς ὁ καιρὸς αὔριον ἀποστελῶ πρὸς σὲ ἄνδρα ἐκ γῆς Βενιαμιν καὶ χρίσεις αὐτὸν εἰς ἄρχοντα ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου Ισραηλ καὶ σώσει τὸν λαόν μου ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων ὅτι ἐπέβλεψα ἐπὶ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τοῦ λαοῦ μου ὅτι ἦλθεν βοὴ αὐτῶν πρός με
17 καὶ Σαμουηλ εἶδεν τὸν Σαουλ καὶ κύριος ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ ἰδοὺ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃν εἶπά σοι οὗτος ἄρξει ἐν τῷ λαῷ μου

18 καὶ προσήγαγεν Σαουλ πρὸς Σαμουηλ εἰς μέσον τῆς πόλεως καὶ εἶπεν ἀπάγγειλον δὴ ποῖος ὁ οἶκος τοῦ βλέποντος
19 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Σαμουηλ τῷ Σαουλ καὶ εἶπεν ἐγώ εἰμι αὐτός ἀνάβηθι ἔμπροσθέν μου εἰς Βαμα καὶ φάγε με{T'} ἐμοῦ σήμερον καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ σε πρωὶ καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου ἀπαγγελῶ σοι
20 καὶ περὶ τῶν ὄνων σου τῶν ἀπολωλυιῶν σήμερον τριταίων μὴ θῇς τὴν καρδίαν σου αὐταῖς ὅτι εὕρηνται καὶ τίνι τὰ ὡραῖα τοῦ Ισραηλ οὐ σοὶ καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός σου
21 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Σαουλ καὶ εἶπεν οὐχὶ ἀνδρὸς υἱὸς Ιεμιναίου ἐγώ εἰμι τοῦ μικροῦ σκήπτρου φυλῆς Ισραηλ καὶ τῆς φυλῆς τῆς ἐλαχίστης ἐξ ὅλου σκήπτρου Βενιαμιν καὶ ἵνα τί ἐλάλησας πρὸς ἐμὲ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο

22 καὶ ἔλαβεν Σαμουηλ τὸν Σαουλ καὶ τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ κατάλυμα καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοῖς τόπον ἐν πρώτοις τῶν κεκλημένων ὡσεὶ ἑβδομήκοντα ἀνδρῶν
23 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ τῷ μαγείρῳ δός μοι τὴν μερίδα ἣν ἔδωκά σοι ἣν εἶπά σοι θεῖναι αὐτὴν παρὰ σοί
24 καὶ ὕψωσεν ὁ μάγειρος τὴν κωλέαν καὶ παρέθηκεν αὐτὴν ἐνώπιον Σαουλ καὶ εἶπεν Σαμουηλ τῷ Σαουλ ἰδοὺ ὑπόλειμμα παράθες αὐτὸ ἐνώπιόν σου καὶ φάγε ὅτι εἰς μαρτύριον τέθειταί σοι παρὰ τοὺς ἄλλους ἀπόκνιζε καὶ ἔφαγεν Σαουλ μετὰ Σαμουηλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ
25 καὶ κατέβη ἐκ τῆς Βαμα ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ διέστρωσαν τῷ Σαουλ ἐπὶ τῷ δώματι
26 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἀνέβαινεν ὁ ὄρθρος καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Σαμουηλ τὸν Σαουλ ἐπὶ τῷ δώματι λέγων ἀνάστα καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ σε καὶ ἀνέστη Σαουλ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν αὐτὸς καὶ Σαμουηλ ἕως ἔξω
27 αὐτῶν καταβαινόντων εἰς μέρος τῆς πόλεως καὶ Σαμουηλ εἶπεν τῷ Σαουλ εἰπὸν τῷ νεανίσκῳ καὶ διελθέτω ἔμπροσθεν ἡμῶν καὶ σὺ στῆθι ὡς σήμερον καὶ ἄκουσον ῥῆμα θεοῦ
