# First Book of Samuel 31 (RSVCE)

### The Death of Saul and His Sons
1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboʹa.
2 And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinʹadab and Malʹchishuʹa, the sons of Saul.
3 The battle pressed hard upon Saul, and the archers found him; and he was badly wounded by the archers.
4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and make sport of me.” But his armor-bearer would not; for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword, and fell upon it.
5 And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword, and died with him.
6 Thus Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men, on the same day together.
7 And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
8 On the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboʹa.
9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.
10 They put his armor in the temple of Ashʹtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
11 But when the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
12 all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh and burnt them there.
13 And they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.


# Liber Primus Samuelis, Quem Nos Primum Regum Dicimus 31 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Philisthiim autem pugnabant adversum Israël: et fugerunt viri Israël ante faciem Philisthiim, et ceciderunt interfecti in monte Gelboë.
2 Irrueruntque Philisthiim in Saul et in filios ejus, et percusserunt Jonathan, et Abinadab, et Melchisua filios Saul:
3 totumque pondus prælii versum est in Saul, et consecuti sunt eum viri sagittarii, et vulneratus est vehementer a sagittariis.
4 Dixitque Saul ad armigerum suum: Evagina gladium tuum, et percute me: ne forte veniant incircumcisi isti, et interficiant me, illudentes mihi. Et noluit armiger ejus: fuerat enim nimio terrore perterritus. Arripuit itaque Saul gladium, et irruit super eum.
5 Quod cum vidisset armiger ejus, videlicet quod mortuus esset Saul, irruit etiam ipse super gladium suum, et mortuus est cum eo.
6 Mortuus est ergo Saul, et tres filii ejus, et armiger illius, et universi viri ejus in die illa pariter.

7 Videntes autem viri Israël qui erant trans vallem et trans Jordanem, quod fugissent viri Israëlitæ, et quod mortuus esset Saul et filii ejus, reliquerunt civitates suas, et fugerunt: veneruntque Philisthiim, et habitaverunt ibi.
8 Facta autem die altera, venerunt Philisthiim ut spoliarent interfectos, et invenerunt Saul et tres filios ejus jacentes in monte Gelboë.
9 Et præciderunt caput Saul, et spoliaverunt eum armis: et miserunt in terram Philisthinorum per circuitum, ut annuntiaretur in templo idolorum, et in populis.
10 Et posuerunt arma ejus in templo Astaroth, corpus vero ejus suspenderunt in muro Bethsan.
11 Quod cum audissent habitatores Jabes Galaad, quæcumque fecerant Philisthiim Saul,
12 surrexerunt omnes viri fortissimi, et ambulaverunt tota nocte, et tulerunt cadaver Saul, et cadavera filiorum ejus, de muro Bethsan: veneruntque Jabes Galaad, et combusserunt ea ibi:
13 et tulerunt ossa eorum, et sepelierunt in nemore Jabes, et jejunaverunt septem diebus.

1 καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπολέμουν ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ ἄνδρες Ισραηλ ἐκ προσώπου τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ πίπτουσιν τραυματίαι ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ Γελβουε
2 καὶ συνάπτουσιν ἀλλόφυλοι τῷ Σαουλ καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ τύπτουσιν ἀλλόφυλοι τὸν Ιωναθαν καὶ τὸν Αμιναδαβ καὶ τὸν Μελχισα υἱοὺς Σαουλ
3 καὶ βαρύνεται ὁ πόλεμος ἐπὶ Σαουλ καὶ εὑρίσκουσιν αὐτὸν οἱ ἀκοντισταί ἄνδρες τοξόται καὶ ἐτραυματίσθη εἰς τὰ ὑποχόνδρια
4 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ πρὸς τὸν αἴροντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ σπάσαι τὴν ῥομφαίαν σου καὶ ἀποκέντησόν με ἐν αὐτῇ μὴ ἔλθωσιν οἱ ἀπερίτμητοι οὗτοι καὶ ἀποκεντήσωσίν με καὶ ἐμπαίξωσίν μοι καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλετο ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐφοβήθη σφόδρα καὶ ἔλαβεν Σαουλ τὴν ῥομφαίαν καὶ ἐπέπεσεν ἐ{P'} αὐτήν
5 καὶ εἶδεν ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ὅτι τέθνηκεν Σαουλ καὶ ἐπέπεσεν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπὶ τὴν ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέθανεν με{T'} αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ ἀπέθανεν Σαουλ καὶ οἱ τρεῖς υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ κατὰ τὸ αὐτό

7 καὶ εἶδον οἱ ἄνδρες Ισραηλ οἱ ἐν τῷ πέραν τῆς κοιλάδος καὶ οἱ ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ιορδάνου ὅτι ἔφυγον οἱ ἄνδρες Ισραηλ καὶ ὅτι τέθνηκεν Σαουλ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ καταλείπουσιν τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν καὶ φεύγουσιν καὶ ἔρχονται οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ κατοικοῦσιν ἐν αὐταῖς
8 καὶ ἐγενήθη τῇ ἐπαύριον καὶ ἔρχονται οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐκδιδύσκειν τοὺς νεκροὺς καὶ εὑρίσκουσιν τὸν Σαουλ καὶ τοὺς τρεῖς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ πεπτωκότας ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη Γελβουε
9 καὶ ἀποστρέφουσιν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐξέδυσαν τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀποστέλλουσιν αὐτὰ εἰς γῆν ἀλλοφύλων κύκλῳ εὐαγγελίζοντες τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν καὶ τῷ λαῷ αὐτῶν
10 καὶ ἀνέθηκαν τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ Ἀσταρτεῖον καὶ τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ κατέπηξαν ἐν τῷ τείχει Βαιθσαν
11 καὶ ἀκούουσιν οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ιαβις τῆς Γαλααδίτιδος ἃ ἐποίησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι τῷ Σαουλ
12 καὶ ἀνέστησαν πᾶς ἀνὴρ δυνάμεως καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὅλην τὴν νύκτα καὶ ἔλαβον τὸ σῶμα Σαουλ καὶ τὸ σῶμα Ιωναθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τείχους Βαιθσαν καὶ φέρουσιν αὐτοὺς εἰς Ιαβις καὶ κατακαίουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ
13 καὶ λαμβάνουσιν τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν καὶ θάπτουσιν ὑπὸ τὴν ἄρουραν τὴν Ιαβις καὶ νηστεύουσιν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας
