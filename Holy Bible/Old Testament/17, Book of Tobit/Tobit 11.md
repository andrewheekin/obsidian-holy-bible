# Book of Tobit 11 (RSVCE)

### Homeward Journey
1 After this Tobiʹas went on his way, praising God because he had made his journey a success. And he blessed Ragʹuel and his wife Edna. So he continued on his way until they came near to Ninʹeveh.
2 Then Raphʹael said to Tobiʹas, “Are you not aware, brother, of how you left your father?
3 Let us run ahead of your wife and prepare the house.
4 And take the gall of the fish with you.” So they went their way, and the dog went along behind them.
5 Now Anna sat looking intently down the road for her son.
6 And she caught sight of him coming, and said to his father, “Behold, your son is coming, and so is the man who went with him!”
### Tobit’s Sight Restored
7 Raphʹael said, “I know, Tobiʹas, that your father will open his eyes.
8 You therefore must anoint his eyes with the gall; and when they smart he will rub them, and will cause the white films to fall away, and he will see you.”
9 Then Anna ran to meet them, and embraced her son, and said to him, “I have seen you, my child; now I am ready to die.” And they both wept.
10 Tobit started toward the door, and stumbled. But his son ran to him
11 and took hold of his father, and he sprinkled the gall upon his father’s eyes, saying, “Be of good cheer, father.”
12 And when his eyes began to smart he rubbed them,
13 and the white films scaled off from the corners of his eyes.
14 Then he saw his son and embraced him, and he wept and said, “Blessed art thou, O God, and blessed is thy name for ever, and blessed are all thy holy angels.
15 For thou hast afflicted me, but thou hast had mercy upon me; here I see my son Tobiʹas!” And his son went in rejoicing, and he reported to his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.
16 Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter-in-law at the gate of Ninʹeveh, rejoicing and praising God. Those who saw him as he went were amazed because he could see.
17 And Tobit gave thanks before them that God had been merciful to him. When Tobit came near to Sarah his daughter-in-law, he blessed her, saying, “Welcome, daughter! Blessed is God who has brought you to us, and blessed are your father and your mother.” So there was rejoicing among all his brethren in Ninʹeveh.
18 Ahiʹkar and his nephew Nadab came,
19 and Tobiʹas’ marriage was celebrated for seven days with great festivity.


# Liber Tobiae 11 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Cumque reverterentur, pervenerunt ad Charan, quæ est in medio itinere contra Niniven, undecimo die.
2 Dixitque angelus: Tobia frater, scis quemadmodum reliquisti patrem tuum.
3 Si placet itaque tibi, præcedamus, et lento gradu sequantur iter nostrum familiæ, simul cum conjuge tua, et cum animalibus.
4 Cumque hoc placuisset ut irent, dixit Raphaël ad Tobiam: Tolle tecum ex felle piscis: erit enim necessarium. Tulit itaque Tobias ex felle illo, et abierunt.

5 Anna autem sedebat secus viam quotidie in supercilio montis, unde respicere poterat de longinquo.
6 Et dum ex eodem loco specularetur adventum ejus, vidit a longe, et illico agnovit venientem filium suum: currensque nuntiavit viro suo, dicens: Ecce venit filius tuus.

7 Dixitque Raphaël ad Tobiam: At ubi introieris domum tuam, statim adora Dominum Deum tuum: et gratias agens ei, accede ad patrem tuum, et osculare eum.
8 Statimque lini super oculos ejus ex felle isto piscis, quod portas tecum: scias enim quoniam mox aperientur oculi ejus, et videbit pater tuus lumen cæli, et in aspectu tuo gaudebit.

9 Tunc præcucurrit canis, qui simul fuerat in via: et quasi nuntius adveniens, blandimento suæ caudæ gaudebat.
10 Et consurgens cæcus pater ejus, cœpit offendens pedibus currere: et data manu puero, occurrit obviam filio suo.
11 Et suscipiens osculatus est eum cum uxore sua, et cœperunt ambo flere præ gaudio.
12 Cumque adorassent Deum, et gratias egissent, consederunt.

13 Tunc sumens Tobias de felle piscis, linivit oculos patris sui.
14 Et sustinuit quasi dimidiam fere horam: et cœpit albugo ex oculis ejus, quasi membrana ovi, egredi.
15 Quam apprehendens Tobias, traxit ab oculis ejus: statimque visum recepit.
16 Et glorificabant Deum, ipse videlicet et uxor ejus, et omnes qui sciebant eum.
17 Dicebatque Tobias: Benedico te, Domine Deus Israël, quia tu castigasti me, et tu salvasti me: et ecce ego video Tobiam filium meum.

18 Ingressa est etiam post septem dies Sara uxor filii ejus et omnis familia sana, et pecora, et cameli, et pecunia multa uxoris; sed et illa pecunia, quam receperat a Gabelo.
19 Et narravit parentibus suis omnia beneficia Dei, quæ fecisset circa eum per hominem qui eum duxerat.
20 Veneruntque Achior et Nabath consobrini Tobiæ gaudentes ad Tobiam, et congratulantes ei de omnibus bonis quæ circa illum ostenderat Deus.
21 Et per septem dies epulantes, omnes cum gaudio magno gavisi sunt.


# Τωβίτ 11 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐπορεύετο μέχρις οὗ ἐγγίσαι αὐτοὺς εἰς Νινευη
2 καὶ εἶπεν Ραφαηλ πρὸς Τωβιαν οὐ γινώσκεις ἄδελφε πῶς ἀφῆκας τὸν πατέρα σου
3 προδράμωμεν ἔμπροσθεν τῆς γυναικός σου καὶ ἑτοιμάσωμεν τὴν οἰκίαν
4 λαβὲ δὲ παρὰ χεῖρα τὴν χολὴν τοῦ ἰχθύος καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν καὶ συνῆλθεν ὁ κύων ὄπισθεν αὐτῶν

5 καὶ Αννα ἐκάθητο περιβλεπομένη εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν τὸν παῖδα αὐτῆς
6 καὶ προσενόησεν αὐτὸν ἐρχόμενον καὶ εἶπεν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ ἰδοὺ ὁ υἱός σου ἔρχεται καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ πορευθεὶς με{T'} αὐτοῦ

7 καὶ Ραφαηλ εἶπεν ἐπίσταμαι ἐγὼ ὅτι ἀνοίξει τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὁ πατήρ σου
8 σὺ οὖν ἔγχρισον τὴν χολὴν εἰς τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ δηχθεὶς διατρίψει καὶ ἀποβαλεῖ τὰ λευκώματα καὶ ὄψεταί σε

9 καὶ προσδραμοῦσα Αννα ἐπέπεσεν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ εἶδόν σε παιδίον ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν ἀποθανοῦμαι καὶ ἔκλαυσαν ἀμφότεροι
10 καὶ Τωβιτ ἐξήρχετο πρὸς τὴν θύραν καὶ προσέκοπτεν ὁ δὲ υἱὸς προσέδραμεν αὐτῷ
11 καὶ ἐπελάβετο τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ προσέπασεν τὴν χολὴν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ λέγων θάρσει πάτερ
12 ὡς δὲ συνεδήχθησαν διέτριψε τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ

13 καὶ ἐλεπίσθη ἀπὸ τῶν κανθῶν τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ τὰ λευκώματα καὶ ἰδὼν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπέπεσεν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ ἔκλαυσεν καὶ εἶπεν εὐλογητὸς εἶ ὁ θεός καὶ εὐλογητὸν τὸ ὄνομά σου εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας καὶ εὐλογημένοι πάντες οἱ ἅγιοί σου ἄγγελοι
15 ὅτι ἐμαστίγωσας καὶ ἠλέησάς με ἰδοὺ βλέπω Τωβιαν τὸν υἱόν μου καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ χαίρων καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ τὰ μεγαλεῖα τὰ γενόμενα αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ Μηδίᾳ
16 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Τωβιτ εἰς συνάντησιν τῇ νύμφῃ αὐτοῦ χαίρων καὶ εὐλογῶν τὸν θεὸν πρὸς τῇ πύλῃ Νινευη καὶ ἐθαύμαζον οἱ θεωροῦντες αὐτὸν πορευόμενον ὅτι ἔβλεψεν
17 καὶ Τωβιτ ἐξωμολογεῖτο ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν ὅτι ἠλέησεν αὐτὸν ὁ θεός καὶ ὡς ἤγγισεν Τωβιτ Σαρρα τῇ νύμφῃ αὐτοῦ κατευλόγησεν αὐτὴν λέγων ἔλθοις ὑγιαίνουσα θύγατερ εὐλογητὸς ὁ θεός ὃς ἤγαγέν σε πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ ὁ πατήρ σου καὶ ἡ μήτηρ σου καὶ ἐγένετο χαρὰ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐν Νινευη ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ

18 καὶ παρεγένετο Αχιαχαρος καὶ Νασβας ὁ ἐξάδελφος αὐτοῦ
19 καὶ ἤχθη ὁ γάμος Τωβια με{T'} εὐφροσύνης ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας
