# Book of Tobit 14 (RSVCE)

### Tobit’s Final Counsel
1 Here Tobit ended his words of praise.
2 He was fifty-eight years old when he lost his sight, and after eight years he regained it. He gave alms, and he continued to fear the Lord God and to praise him.
3 When he had grown very old he called his son and grandsons, and said to him, “My son, take your sons; behold, I have grown old and am about to depart this life.
4 Go to Media, my son, for I fully believe what Jonah the prophet said about Ninʹeveh, that it will be overthrown. But in Media there will be peace for a time. Our brethren will be scattered over the earth from the good land, and Jerusalem will be desolate. The house of God in it will be burned down and will be in ruins for a time.
5 But God will again have mercy on them, and bring them back into their land; and they will rebuild the house of God, though it will not be like the former one until the times of the age are completed. After this they will return from the places of their captivity, and will rebuild Jerusalem in splendor. And the house of God will be rebuilt there with a glorious building for all generations for ever, just as the prophets said of it.
6 Then all the Gentiles will turn to fear the Lord God in truth, and will bury their idols.
7 All the Gentiles will praise the Lord, and his people will give thanks to God, and the Lord will exalt his people. And all who love the Lord God in truth and righteousness will rejoice, showing mercy to our brethren.
8 “So now, my son, leave Ninʹeveh, because what the prophet Jonah said will surely happen.
9 But keep the law and the commandments, and be merciful and just, so that it may be well with you.
10 Bury me properly, and your mother with me. And do not live in Ninʹeveh any longer. See, my son, what Nadab did to Ahiʹkar who had reared him, how he brought him from light into darkness, and with what he repaid him. But Ahiʹkar was saved, and the other received repayment as he himself went down into the darkness. Ahiʹkar gave alms and escaped the deathtrap which Nadab had set for him; but Nadab fell into the trap and perished.
11 So now, my children, consider what almsgiving accomplishes and how righteousness delivers.” As he said this he died in his bed. He was a hundred and fifty-eight years old; and Tobiʹas gave him a magnificent funeral.
### Death of Tobit and Anna
12 And when Anna died he buried her with his father. Then Tobiʹas returned with his wife and his sons to Ecbatʹana, to Ragʹuel his father-in-law.
13 He grew old with honor, and he gave his father-in-law and mother-in-law magnificent funerals. He inherited their property and that of his father Tobit.
14 He died in Ecbatʹana of Media at the age of a hundred and twenty-seven years.
15 But before he died he heard of the destruction of Ninʹeveh, which Nebuchadnezʹzar and Ahasu-eʹrus had captured. Before his death he rejoiced over Ninʹeveh.


# Liber Tobiae 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et consummati sunt sermones Tobiæ. Et postquam illuminatus est Tobias, vixit annis quadraginta duobus, et vidit filios nepotum suorum.
2 Completis itaque annis centum duobus, sepultus est honorifice in Ninive.
3 Quinquaginta namque et sex annorum lumen oculorum amisit, sexagenarius vero recepit.
4 Reliquum vero vitæ suæ in gaudio fuit, et cum bono profectu timoris Dei perrexit in pace.

5 In hora autem mortis suæ vocavit ad se Tobiam filium suum, et septem juvenes filios ejus nepotes suos, dixitque eis:
6 Prope erit interitus Ninive: non enim excidit verbum Domini: et fratres nostri, qui dispersi sunt a terra Israël, revertentur ad eam.
7 Omnis autem deserta terra ejus replebitur, et domus Dei, quæ in ea incensa est, iterum reædificabitur: ibique revertentur omnes timentes Deum,
8 et relinquent gentes idola sua, et venient in Jerusalem, et inhabitabunt in ea:
9 et gaudebunt in ea omnes reges terræ, adorantes regem Israël.

10 Audite ergo, filii mei, patrem vestrum: servite Domino in veritate, et inquirite ut faciatis quæ placita sunt illi:
11 et filiis vestris mandate ut faciant justitias et eleemosynas, ut sint memores Dei, et benedicant eum in omni tempore in veritate, et in tota virtute sua.
12 Nunc ergo filii, audite me, et nolite manere hic: sed quacumque die sepelieritis matrem vestram circa me in uno sepulchro, ex eo dirigite gressus vestros ut exeatis hinc:
13 video enim quia iniquitas ejus finem dabit ei.

14 Factum est autem post obitum matris suæ, Tobias abscessit ex Ninive cum uxore sua, et filiis, et filiorum filiis, et reversus est ad soceros suos:
15 invenitque eos incolumes in senectute bona: et curam eorum gessit, et ipse clausit oculos eorum: et omnem hæreditatem domus Raguelis ipse percepit: viditque quintam generationem, filios filiorum suorum.
16 Et completis annis nonaginta novem in timore Domini, cum gaudio sepelierunt eum.
17 Omnis autem cognatio ejus et omnis generatio ejus in bona vita et in sancta conversatione permansit, ita ut accepti essent tam Deo quam hominibus, et cunctis habitantibus in terra.


# Τωβίτ 14 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐπαύσατο ἐξομολογούμενος Τωβιτ
2 καὶ ἦν ἐτῶν πεντήκοντα ὀκτώ ὅτε ἀπώλεσεν τὰς ὄψεις καὶ μετὰ ἔτη ὀκτὼ ἀνέβλεψεν καὶ ἐποίει ἐλεημοσύνας καὶ προσέθετο φοβεῖσθαι κύριον τὸν θεὸν καὶ ἐξομολογεῖσθαι αὐτῷ
3 μεγάλως δὲ ἐγήρασεν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τέκνον λαβὲ τοὺς υἱούς σου ἰδοὺ γεγήρακα καὶ πρὸς τὸ ἀποτρέχειν ἐκ τοῦ ζῆν εἰμι
4 ἄπελθε εἰς τὴν Μηδίαν τέκνον ὅτι πέπεισμαι ὅσα ἐλάλησεν Ιωνας ὁ προφήτης περὶ Νινευη ὅτι καταστραφήσεται ἐν δὲ τῇ Μηδίᾳ ἔσται εἰρήνη μᾶλλον ἕως καιροῦ καὶ ὅτι οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ σκορπισθήσονται ἀπὸ τῆς ἀγαθῆς γῆς καὶ Ιεροσόλυμα ἔσται ἔρημος καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῇ κατακαήσεται καὶ ἔρημος ἔσται μέχρι χρόνου

5 καὶ πάλιν ἐλεήσει αὐτοὺς ὁ θεὸς καὶ ἐπιστρέψει αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσιν τὸν οἶκον οὐχ οἷος ὁ πρότερος ἕως πληρωθῶσιν καιροὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐπιστρέψουσιν ἐκ τῶν αἰχμαλωσιῶν καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσιν Ιερουσαλημ ἐντίμως καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῇ οἰκοδομηθήσεται εἰς πάσας τὰς γενεὰς τοῦ αἰῶνος οἰκοδομῇ ἐνδόξῳ καθὼς ἐλάλησαν περὶ αὐτῆς οἱ προφῆται
6 καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἐπιστρέψουσιν ἀληθινῶς φοβεῖσθαι κύριον τὸν θεὸν καὶ κατορύξουσιν τὰ εἴδωλα αὐτῶν καὶ εὐλογήσουσιν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὸν κύριον
7 καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ ἐξομολογήσεται τῷ θεῷ καὶ ὑψώσει κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ χαρήσονται πάντες οἱ ἀγαπῶντες κύριον τὸν θεὸν ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ δικαιοσύνῃ ποιοῦντες ἔλεος τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἡμῶν
8 καὶ νῦν τέκνον ἄπελθε ἀπὸ Νινευη ὅτι πάντως ἔσται ἃ ἐλάλησεν ὁ προφήτης Ιωνας
9 σὺ δὲ τήρησον τὸν νόμον καὶ τὰ προστάγματα καὶ γίνου φιλελεήμων καὶ δίκαιος ἵνα σοι καλῶς ᾖ καὶ θάψον με καλῶς καὶ τὴν μητέρα σου με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ μηκέτι αὐλισθῆτε εἰς Νινευη

10 τέκνον ἰδὲ τί ἐποίησεν Αμαν Αχιαχάρῳ τῷ θρέψαντι αὐτόν ὡς ἐκ τοῦ φωτὸς ἤγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ σκότος καὶ ὅσα ἀνταπέδωκεν αὐτῷ καὶ Αχιαχαρος μὲν ἐσώθη ἐκείνῳ δὲ τὸ ἀνταπόδομα ἀπεδόθη καὶ αὐτὸς κατέβη εἰς τὸ σκότος Μανασσης ἐποίησεν ἐλεημοσύνην καὶ ἐσώθη ἐκ παγίδος θανάτου ἧς ἔπηξεν αὐτῷ Αμαν δὲ ἐνέπεσεν εἰς τὴν παγίδα καὶ ἀπώλετο
11 καὶ νῦν παιδία ἴδετε τί ἐλεημοσύνη ποιεῖ καὶ τί δικαιοσύνη ῥύεται καὶ ταῦτα αὐτοῦ λέγοντος ἐξέλιπεν αὐτοῦ ἡ ψυχὴ ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης ἦν δὲ ἐτῶν ἑκατὸν πεντήκοντα ὀκτώ καὶ ἔθαψεν αὐτὸν ἐνδόξως
12 καὶ ὅτε ἀπέθανεν Αννα ἔθαψεν αὐτὴν μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπῆλθεν δὲ Τωβιας μετὰ τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἐκβάτανα πρὸς Ραγουηλ τὸν πενθερὸν αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ ἐγήρασεν ἐντίμως καὶ ἔθαψεν τοὺς πενθεροὺς αὐτοῦ ἐνδόξως καὶ ἐκληρονόμησεν τὴν οὐσίαν αὐτῶν καὶ Τωβιτ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ

14 καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐτῶν ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι ἑπτὰ ἐν Ἐκβατάνοις τῆς Μηδίας
15 καὶ ἤκουσεν πρὶν ἢ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτὸν τὴν ἀπώλειαν Νινευη ἣν ᾐχμαλώτισεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ καὶ Ασυηρος ἐχάρη πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν ἐπὶ Νινευη
