# Book of Tobit 12 (RSVCE)

### Raphʹael’s Wages
1 Tobit then called his son Tobiʹas and said to him, “My son, see to the wages of the man who went with you; and he must also be given more.”
2 He replied, “Father, it would do me no harm to give him half of what I have brought back.
3 For he has led me back to you safely, he cured my wife, he obtained the money for me, and he also healed you.”
4 The old man said, “He deserves it.”
5 So he called the angel and said to him, “Take half of all that you two have brought back.”
### Raphʹael’s Exhortation
6 Then the angel called the two of them privately and said to them: “Praise God and give thanks to him; exalt him and give thanks to him in the presence of all the living for what he has done for you. It is good to praise God and to exalt his name, worthily declaring the works of God. Do not be slow to give him thanks.
7 It is good to guard the secret of a king, but gloriously to reveal the works of God. Do good, and evil will not overtake you.
8 Prayer is good when accompanied by fasting, almsgiving, and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with wrongdoing. It is better to give alms than to treasure up gold.
9 For almsgiving delivers from death, and it will purge away every sin. Those who perform deeds of charity and of righteousness will have fulness of life;
10 but those who commit sin are the enemies of their own lives.
### Raphʹael Discloses His Identity
11 “I will not conceal anything from you. I have said, ‘It is good to guard the secret of a king, but gloriously to reveal the works of God.’
12 And so, when you and your daughter-in-law Sarah prayed, I brought a reminder of your prayer before the Holy One; and when you buried the dead, I was likewise present with you.
13 When you did not hesitate to rise and leave your dinner in order to go and lay out the dead, your good deed was not hidden from me, but I was with you.
14 So now God sent me to heal you and your daughter-in-law Sarah.
15 I am Raphʹael, one of the seven holy angels who present the prayers of the saints and enter into the presence of the glory of the Holy One.”
16 They were both alarmed; and they fell upon their faces, for they were afraid.
17 But he said to them, “Do not be afraid; you will be safe. But praise God for ever.
18 For I did not come as a favor on my part, but by the will of our God. Therefore praise him for ever.
19 All these days I merely appeared to you and did not eat or drink, but you were seeing a vision.
20 And now give thanks to God, for I am ascending to him who sent me. Write in a book everything that has happened.”
21 Then they stood up; but they saw him no more.
22 So they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and acknowledged that the angel of the Lord had appeared to them.


# Liber Tobiae 12 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Tunc vocavit ad se Tobias filium suum, dixitque ei: Quid possumus dare viro isti sancto, qui venit tecum?
2 Respondens Tobias, dixit patri suo: Pater, quam mercedem dabimus ei? aut quid dignum poterit esse beneficiis ejus?
3 Me duxit et reduxit sanum, pecuniam a Gabelo ipse recepit, uxorem ipse me habere fecit, et dæmonium ab ea ipse compescuit: gaudium parentibus ejus fecit, meipsum a devoratione piscis eripuit, te quoque videre fecit lumen cæli, et bonis omnibus per eum repleti sumus. Quid illi ad hæc poterimus dignum dare?
4 Sed peto te, pater mi, ut roges eum, si forte dignabitur medietatem de omnibus quæ allata sunt, sibi assumere.

5 Et vocantes eum, pater scilicet et filius, tulerunt eum in partem: et rogare cœperunt ut dignaretur dimidiam partem omnium quæ attulerant acceptam habere.
6 Tunc dixit eis occulte: Benedicite Deum cæli, et coram omnibus viventibus confitemini ei, quia fecit vobiscum misericordiam suam.
7 Etenim sacramentum regis abscondere bonum est: opera autem Dei revelare et confiteri honorificum est.

8 Bona est oratio cum jejunio, et eleemosyna magis quam thesauros auri recondere:
9 quoniam eleemosyna a morte liberat, et ipsa est quæ purgat peccata, et facit invenire misericordiam et viam æternam.
10 Qui autem faciunt peccatum et iniquitatem, hostes sunt animæ suæ.
11 Manifesto ergo vobis veritatem, et non abscondam a vobis occultum sermonem.
12 Quando orabas cum lacrimis, et sepeliebas mortuos, et derelinquebas prandium tuum, et mortuos abscondebas per diem in domo tua, et nocte sepeliebas eos, ego obtuli orationem tuam Domino.
13 Et quia acceptus eras Deo, necesse fuit ut tentatio probaret te.
14 Et nunc misit me Dominus ut curarem te, et Saram uxorem filii tui a dæmonio liberarem.
15 Ego enim sum Raphaël angelus, unus ex septem qui adstamus ante Dominum.

16 Cumque hæc audissent, turbati sunt, et trementes ceciderunt super terram in faciem suam.
17 Dixitque eis angelus: Pax vobis: nolite timere.
18 Etenim cum essem vobiscum, per voluntatem Dei eram: ipsum benedicite, et cantate illi.
19 Videbar quidem vobiscum manducare et bibere: sed ego cibo invisibili, et potu qui ab hominibus videri non potest, utor.
20 Tempus est ergo ut revertar ad eum qui me misit: vos autem benedicite Deum, et narrate omnia mirabilia ejus.
21 Et cum hæc dixisset, ab aspectu eorum ablatus est, et ultra eum videre non potuerunt.
22 Tunc prostrati per horas tres in faciem, benedixerunt Deum: et exsurgentes narraverunt omnia mirabilia ejus.


# Τωβίτ 12 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Τωβιτ Τωβιαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὅρα τέκνον μισθὸν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τῷ συνελθόντι σοι καὶ προσθεῖναι αὐτῷ δεῖ
2 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ πάτερ οὐ βλάπτομαι δοὺς αὐτῷ τὸ ἥμισυ ὧν ἐνήνοχα
3 ὅτι με ἀγείοχέν σοι ὑγιῆ καὶ τὴν γυναῖκά μου ἐθεράπευσεν καὶ τὸ ἀργύριόν μου ἤνεγκεν καὶ σὲ ὁμοίως ἐθεράπευσεν
4 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ πρεσβύτης δικαιοῦται αὐτῷ

5 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸν ἄγγελον καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ λαβὲ τὸ ἥμισυ πάντων ὧν ἐνηνόχατε
6 τότε καλέσας τοὺς δύο κρυπτῶς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς εὐλογεῖτε τὸν θεὸν καὶ αὐτῷ ἐξομολογεῖσθε μεγαλωσύνην δίδοτε αὐτῷ καὶ ἐξομολογεῖσθε ἐνώπιον πάντων τῶν ζώντων περὶ ὧν ἐποίησεν με{Q'} ὑμῶν ἀγαθὸν τὸ εὐλογεῖν τὸν θεὸν καὶ ὑψοῦν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ τοὺς λόγους τῶν ἔργων τοῦ θεοῦ ἐντίμως ὑποδεικνύοντες καὶ μὴ ὀκνεῖτε ἐξομολογεῖσθαι αὐτῷ
7 μυστήριον βασιλέως καλὸν κρύψαι τὰ δὲ ἔργα τοῦ θεοῦ ἀνακαλύπτειν ἐνδόξως ἀγαθὸν ποιήσατε καὶ κακὸν οὐχ εὑρήσει ὑμᾶς

8 ἀγαθὸν προσευχὴ μετὰ νηστείας καὶ ἐλεημοσύνης καὶ δικαιοσύνης ἀγαθὸν τὸ ὀλίγον μετὰ δικαιοσύνης ἢ πολὺ μετὰ ἀδικίας καλὸν ποιῆσαι ἐλεημοσύνην ἢ θησαυρίσαι χρυσίον
9 ἐλεημοσύνη γὰρ ἐκ θανάτου ῥύεται καὶ αὐτὴ ἀποκαθαριεῖ πᾶσαν ἁμαρτίαν οἱ ποιοῦντες ἐλεημοσύνας καὶ δικαιοσύνας πλησθήσονται ζωῆς
10 οἱ δὲ ἁμαρτάνοντες πολέμιοί εἰσιν τῆς ἑαυτῶν ζωῆς
11 οὐ μὴ κρύψω ἀ{F'} ὑμῶν πᾶν ῥῆμα εἴρηκα δή μυστήριον βασιλέως κρύψαι καλόν τὰ δὲ ἔργα τοῦ θεοῦ ἀνακαλύπτειν ἐνδόξως
12 καὶ νῦν ὅτε προσηύξω σὺ καὶ ἡ νύμφη σου Σαρρα ἐγὼ προσήγαγον τὸ μνημόσυνον τῆς προσευχῆς ὑμῶν ἐνώπιον τοῦ ἁγίου καὶ ὅτε ἔθαπτες τοὺς νεκρούς ὡσαύτως συμπαρήμην σοι
13 καὶ ὅτε οὐκ ὤκνησας ἀναστῆναι καὶ καταλιπεῖν τὸ ἄριστόν σου ὅπως ἀπελθὼν περιστείλῃς τὸν νεκρόν οὐκ ἔλαθές με ἀγαθοποιῶν ἀλλὰ σὺν σοὶ ἤμην
14 καὶ νῦν ἀπέστειλέν με ὁ θεὸς ἰάσασθαί σε καὶ τὴν νύμφην σου Σαρραν
15 ἐγώ εἰμι Ραφαηλ εἷς ἐκ τῶν ἑπτὰ ἁγίων ἀγγέλων οἳ προσαναφέρουσιν τὰς προσευχὰς τῶν ἁγίων καὶ εἰσπορεύονται ἐνώπιον τῆς δόξης τοῦ ἁγίου

16 καὶ ἐταράχθησαν οἱ δύο καὶ ἔπεσον ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ὅτι ἐφοβήθησαν
17 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς μὴ φοβεῖσθε εἰρήνη ὑμῖν ἔσται τὸν δὲ θεὸν εὐλογεῖτε εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
18 ὅτι οὐ τῇ ἐμαυτοῦ χάριτι ἀλλὰ τῇ θελήσει τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἦλθον ὅθεν εὐλογεῖτε αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
19 πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ὠπτανόμην ὑμῖν καὶ οὐκ ἔφαγον οὐδὲ ἔπιον ἀλλὰ ὅρασιν ὑμεῖς ἐθεωρεῖτε
20 καὶ νῦν ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ θεῷ διότι ἀναβαίνω πρὸς τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με καὶ γράψατε πάντα τὰ συντελεσθέντα εἰς βιβλίον
21 καὶ ἀνέστησαν καὶ οὐκέτι εἶδον αὐτόν
22 καὶ ἐξωμολογοῦντο τὰ ἔργα τὰ μεγάλα καὶ θαυμαστὰ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ὡς ὤφθη αὐτοῖς ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου
