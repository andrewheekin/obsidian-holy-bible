# Book of Tobit 7 (RSVCE)

### Arrival at Home of Raguel
1 When they reached Ecbatʹana and arrived at the house of Ragʹuel, Sarah met them and greeted them. They returned her greeting, and she brought them into the house.
2 Then Ragʹuel said to his wife Edna, “How much the young man resembles my cousin Tobit!”
3 And Ragʹuel asked them, “Where are you from, brethren?” They answered him, “We belong to the sons of Naphʹtali, who are captives in Ninʹeveh.”
4 So he said to them, “Do you know our brother Tobit?” And they said, “Yes, we do.” And he asked them, “Is he in good health?”
5 They replied, “He is alive and in good health.” And Tobiʹas said, “He is my father.”
6 Then Ragʹuel sprang up and kissed him and wept.
7 And he blessed him and exclaimed, “Son of that good and noble man!” When he heard that Tobit had lost his sight, he was stricken with grief and wept.
### Marriage of Tobias and Sarah
8 And his wife Edna and his daughter Sarah wept. They received them very warmly; and they killed a ram from the flock and set large servings of food before them. Then Tobiʹas said to Raphʹael, “Brother Azariʹas, speak of those things which you talked about on the journey, and let the matter be settled.”
9 So he communicated the proposal to Ragʹuel. And Ragʹuel said to Tobiʹas, “Eat, drink, and be merry;
10 for it is your right to take my child. But let me explain the true situation to you.
11 I have given my daughter to seven husbands, and when each came to her he died in the night. But for the present be merry.” And Tobiʹas said, “I will eat nothing here until you make a binding agreement with me.”
12 So Ragʹuel said, “Take her right now, in accordance with the law. You are her relative, and she is yours. The merciful God will guide you both for the best.”
13 Then he called his daughter Sarah, and taking her by the hand he gave her to Tobiʹas to be his wife, saying, “Here she is; take her according to the law of Moses, and take her with you to your father.” And he blessed them.
14 Next he called his wife Edna, and took a scroll and wrote out the contract; and they set their seals to it.
15 Then they began to eat.
16 And Ragʹuel called his wife Edna and said to her, “Sister, make up the other room, and take her into it.”
17 So she did as he said, and took her there; and the girl began to weep. But the mother comforted her daughter in her tears, and said to her,
18 “Be brave, my child; the Lord of heaven and earth grant you joy in place of this sorrow of yours. Be brave, my daughter.”


# Liber Tobiae 7 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Ingressi sunt autem ad Raguelem, et suscepit eos Raguel cum gaudio.
2 Intuensque Tobiam Raguel, dixit Annæ uxori suæ: Quam similis est juvenis iste consobrino meo!
3 Et cum hæc dixisset, ait: Unde estis juvenes fratres nostri? At illi dixerunt: Ex tribu Nephthali sumus, ex captivitate Ninive.
4 Dixitque illis Raguel: Nostis Tobiam fratrem meum? Qui dixerunt: Novimus.
5 Cumque multa bona loqueretur de eo, dixit angelus ad Raguelem: Tobias, de quo interrogas, pater istius est.
6 Et misit se Raguel, et cum lacrimis osculatus est eum, et plorans supra collum ejus
7 dixit: Benedictio sit tibi, fili mi, quia boni et optimi viri filius es.
8 Et Anna uxor ejus, et Sara ipsorum filia, lacrimatæ sunt.

9 Postquam autem locuti sunt, præcepit Raguel occidi arietem, et parari convivium. Cumque hortaretur eos discumbere ad prandium,
10 Tobias dixit: Hic ego hodie non manducabo neque bibam, nisi prius petitionem meam confirmes, et promittas mihi dare Saram filiam tuam.
11 Quo audito verbo Raguel expavit, sciens quid evenerit illis septem viris qui ingressi sunt ad eam: et timere cœpit ne forte et hunc similiter contingeret. Et cum nutaret, et non daret petenti ullum responsum,
12 dixit ei angelus: Noli timere dare eam isti, quoniam huic timenti Deum debetur conjux filia tua: propterea alius non potuit habere illam.
13 Tunc dixit Raguel: Non dubito quod Deus preces et lacrimas meas in conspectu suo admiserit.
14 Et credo quoniam ideo fecit vos venire ad me, ut ista conjungeretur cognationi suæ secundum legem Moysi: et nunc noli dubium gerere quod tibi eam tradam.
15 Et apprehendens dexteram filiæ suæ, dexteræ Tobiæ tradidit, dicens: Deus Abraham, et Deus Isaac, et Deus Jacob vobiscum sit, et ipse conjungat vos, impleatque benedictionem suam in vobis.

16 Et accepta carta, fecerunt conscriptionem conjugii.
17 Et post hæc epulati sunt, benedicentes Deum.
18 Vocavitque Raguel ad se Annam uxorem suam, et præcepit ei ut præpararet alterum cubiculum.
19 Et introduxit illuc Saram filiam suam, et lacrimata est.
20 Dixitque ei: Forti animo esto, filia mea: Dominus cæli det tibi gaudium pro tædio quod perpessa es.


# Τωβίτ 7 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Ἐκβάτανα καὶ παρεγένοντο εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν Ραγουηλ Σαρρα δὲ ὑπήντησεν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐχαιρέτισεν αὐτοὺς καὶ αὐτοὶ αὐτήν καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν
2 καὶ εἶπεν Ραγουηλ Εδνα τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς ὅμοιος ὁ νεανίσκος Τωβιτ τῷ ἀνεψιῷ μου
3 καὶ ἠρώτησεν αὐτοὺς Ραγουηλ πόθεν ἐστέ ἀδελφοί καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Νεφθαλι τῶν αἰχμαλώτων ἐν Νινευη
4 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς γινώσκετε Τωβιτ τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἡμῶν οἱ δὲ εἶπαν γινώσκομεν
5 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὑγιαίνει οἱ δὲ εἶπαν καὶ ζῇ καὶ ὑγιαίνει καὶ εἶπεν Τωβιας πατήρ μού ἐστιν
6 καὶ ἀνεπήδησεν Ραγουηλ καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἔκλαυσε καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ τοῦ καλοῦ καὶ ἀγαθοῦ ἀνθρώπου καὶ ἀκούσας ὅτι Τωβιτ ἀπώλεσεν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐλυπήθη καὶ ἔκλαυσεν
7 καὶ Εδνα ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ Σαρρα ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτοῦ ἔκλαυσαν καὶ ὑπεδέξαντο αὐτοὺς προθύμως
8 καὶ ἔθυσαν κριὸν προβάτων καὶ παρέθηκαν ὄψα πλείονα

9 εἶπεν δὲ Τωβιας τῷ Ραφαηλ Αζαρια ἄδελφε λάλησον ὑπὲρ ὧν ἔλεγες ἐν τῇ πορείᾳ καὶ τελεσθήτω τὸ πρᾶγμα
10 καὶ μετέδωκεν τὸν λόγον τῷ Ραγουηλ καὶ εἶπεν Ραγουηλ πρὸς Τωβιαν φάγε καὶ πίε καὶ ἡδέως γίνου σοὶ γὰρ καθήκει τὸ παιδίον μου λαβεῖν πλὴν ὑποδείξω σοι τὴν ἀλήθειαν
11 ἔδωκα τὸ παιδίον μου ἑπτὰ ἀνδράσιν καὶ ὁπότε ἐὰν εἰσεπορεύοντο πρὸς αὐτήν ἀπεθνῄσκοσαν ὑπὸ τὴν νύκτα ἀλλὰ τὸ νῦν ἔχων ἡδέως γίνου
12 καὶ εἶπεν Τωβιας οὐ γεύσομαι οὐδὲν ὧδε ἕως ἂν στήσητε καὶ σταθῆτε πρός με καὶ εἶπεν Ραγουηλ κομίζου αὐτὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν κατὰ τὴν κρίσιν σὺ δὲ ἀδελφὸς εἶ αὐτῆς καὶ αὐτή σού ἐστιν ὁ δὲ ἐλεήμων θεὸς εὐοδώσει ὑμῖν τὰ κάλλιστα
13 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Σαρραν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ λαβὼν τῆς χειρὸς αὐτῆς παρέδωκεν αὐτὴν τῷ Τωβια γυναῖκα καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ κατὰ τὸν νόμον Μωυσέως κομίζου αὐτὴν καὶ ἄπαγε πρὸς τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτούς
14 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Εδναν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ λαβὼν βιβλίον ἔγραψεν συγγραφήν καὶ ἐσφραγίσαντο καὶ ἤρξαντο ἐσθίειν
15 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ραγουηλ Εδναν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ἀδελφή ἑτοίμασον τὸ ἕτερον ταμίειον καὶ εἰσάγαγε αὐτήν

16 καὶ ἐποίησεν ὡς εἶπεν καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὴν ἐκεῖ καὶ ἔκλαυσεν καὶ ἀπεδέξατο τὰ δάκρυα τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ
17 θάρσει τέκνον ὁ κύριος τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τῆς γῆς δῴη σοι χάριν ἀντὶ τῆς λύπης σου ταύτης θάρσει θύγατερ
