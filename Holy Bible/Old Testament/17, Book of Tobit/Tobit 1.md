# Book of Tobit 1 (RSVCE)

1 The book of the acts of Tobit the son of Toʹbiel, son of Ananʹiel, son of Adʹuel, son of Gabʹael, of the descendants of Asʹiel and the tribe of Naphʹtali,
2 who in the days of Shalmaneʹser, king of the Assyrians, was taken into captivity from Thisbe, which is to the south of Kedesh Naphʹtali in Galilee above Asher.
### Tobit’s Youth and Virtuous Life
3 I, Tobit, walked in the ways of truth and righteousness all the days of my life, and I performed many acts of charity to my brethren and countrymen who went with me into the land of the Assyrians, to Ninʹeveh.
4 Now when I was in my own country, in the land of Israel, while I was still a young man, the whole tribe of Naphʹtali my forefather deserted the house of Jerusalem. This was the place which had been chosen from among all the tribes of Israel, where all the tribes should sacrifice and where the temple of the dwelling of the Most High was consecrated and established for all generations for ever.
5 All the tribes that joined in apostasy used to sacrifice to the calf Baʹal, and so did the house of Naphʹtali my forefather.
6 But I alone went often to Jerusalem for the feasts, as it is ordained for all Israel by an everlasting decree. Taking the first fruits and the tithes of my produce and the first shearings, I would give these to the priests, the sons of Aaron, at the altar.
7 Of all my produce I would give a tenth to the sons of Levi who ministered at Jerusalem; a second tenth I would sell, and I would go and spend the proceeds each year at Jerusalem;
8 the third tenth I would give to those to whom it was my duty, as Debʹorah my father’s mother had commanded me, for I was left an orphan by my father.
9 When I became a man I married Anna, a member of our family, and by her I became the father of Tobiʹas.
### Taken Captive to Nineveh
10 Now when I was carried away captive to Ninʹeveh, all my brethren and my relatives ate the food of the Gentiles;
11 but I kept myself from eating it,
12 because I remembered God with all my heart.
13 Then the Most High gave me favor and good appearance in the sight of Shalmaneʹser, and I was his buyer of provisions.
14 So I used to go into Media, and once at Rages in Media I left ten talents of silver in trust with Gabʹael, the brother of Gabriʹas.
15 But when Shalmaneʹser died, Sennachʹerib his son reigned in his place; and under him the highways were unsafe, so that I could no longer go into Media.
### Courage in Burying the Dead
16 In the days of Shalmaneʹser I performed many acts of charity to my brethren.
17 I would give my bread to the hungry and my clothing to the naked; and if I saw any one of my people dead and thrown out behind the wall of Ninʹeveh, I would bury him.
18 And if Sennachʹerib the king put to death any who came fleeing from Judea, I buried them secretly. For in his anger he put many to death. When the bodies were sought by the king, they were not found.
19 Then one of the men of Ninʹeveh went and informed the king about me, that I was burying them; so I hid myself. When I learned that I was being searched for, to be put to death, I left home in fear.
20 Then all my property was confiscated and nothing was left to me except my wife Anna and my son Tobiʹas.
21 But not fifty days passed before two of Sennachʹerib’s sons killed him, and they fled to the mountains of Arʹarat. Then Esarhadʹdon, his son, reigned in his place; and he appointed Ahiʹkar, the son of my brother Anʹael, over all the accounts of his kingdom and over the entire administration.
22 Ahiʹkar interceded for me, and I returned to Ninʹeveh. Now Ahiʹkar was cupbearer, keeper of the signet, and in charge of administration of the accounts, for Esarhadʹdon had appointed him second to himself. He was my nephew.


# Liber Tobiae 1 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Tobias ex tribu et civitate Nephthali (quæ est in superioribus Galilææ supra Naasson, post viam quæ ducit ad occidentem, in sinistro habens civitatem Sephet)
2 cum captus esset in diebus Salmanasar regis Assyriorum, in captivitate tamen positus, viam veritatis non deseruit,
3 ita ut omnia quæ habere poterat, quotidie concaptivis fratribus, qui erant ex ejus genere, impertiret.

4 Cumque esset junior omnibus in tribu Nephthali, nihil tamen puerile gessit in opere.
5 Denique, cum irent omnes ad vitulos aureos quos Jeroboam fecerat rex Israël, hic solus fugiebat consortia omnium.
6 Sed pergebat in Jerusalem ad templum Domini, et ibi adorabat Dominum Deum Israël, omnia primitiva sua et decimas suas fideliter offerens,
7 ita ut in tertio anno proselytis et advenis ministraret omnem decimationem.
8 Hæc et his similia secundum legem Dei puerulus observabat.
9 Cum vero factus esset vir, accepit uxorem Annam de tribu sua, genuitque ex ea filium, nomen suum imponens ei:
10 quem ab infantia timere Deum docuit, et abstinere ab omni peccato.

11 Igitur, cum per captivitatem devenisset cum uxore sua et filio in civitatem Niniven cum omni tribu sua
12 (cum omnes ederent ex cibis gentilium), iste custodivit animam suam, et numquam contaminatus est in escis eorum.
13 Et quoniam memor fuit Domini in toto corde suo, dedit illi Deus gratiam in conspectu Salmanasar regis,
14 et dedit illi potestatem quocumque vellet ire, habens libertatem quæcumque facere voluisset.
15 Pergebat ergo ad omnes qui erant in captivitate, et monita salutis dabat eis.
16 Cum autem venisset in Rages civitatem Medorum, et ex his quibus honoratus fuerat a rege, habuisset decem talenta argenti:
17 et cum in multa turba generis sui Gabelum egentem videret, qui erat ex tribu ejus, sub chirographo dedit illi memoratum pondus argenti.

18 Post multum vero temporis, mortuo Salmanasar rege, cum regnaret Sennacherib filius ejus pro eo, et filios Israël exosos haberet in conspectu suo,
19 Tobias quotidie pergebat per omnem cognationem suam, et consolabatur eos, dividebatque unicuique, prout poterat, de facultatibus suis:
20 esurientes alebat, nudisque vestimenta præbebat, et mortuis atque occisis sepulturam sollicitus exhibebat.
21 Denique cum reversus esset rex Sennacherib, fugiens a Judæa plagam quam circa eum fecerat Deus propter blasphemiam suam, et iratus multos occideret ex filiis Israël, Tobias sepeliebat corpora eorum.
22 At ubi nuntiatum est regi, jussit eum occidi, et tulit omnem substantiam ejus.
23 Tobias vero cum filio suo et cum uxore suo fugiens, nudus latuit, quia multi diligebant eum.
24 Post dies vero quadraginta quinque occiderunt regem filii ipsius,
25 et reversus est Tobias in domum suam, omnisque facultas ejus restituta est ei.

3 ἐγὼ Τωβιτ ὁδοῖς ἀληθείας ἐπορευόμην καὶ δικαιοσύνης πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς μου καὶ ἐλεημοσύνας πολλὰς ἐποίησα τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου καὶ τῷ ἔθνει τοῖς συμπορευθεῖσιν με{T'} ἐμοῦ εἰς χώραν Ἀσσυρίων εἰς Νινευη

4 καὶ ὅτε ἤμην ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ μου ἐν τῇ γῇ Ισραηλ νεωτέρου μου ὄντος πᾶσα φυλὴ τοῦ Νεφθαλιμ τοῦ πατρός μου ἀπέστη ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Ιεροσολύμων τῆς ἐκλεγείσης ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν φυλῶν Ισραηλ εἰς τὸ θυσιάζειν πάσας τὰς φυλάς καὶ ἡγιάσθη ὁ ναὸς τῆς κατασκηνώσεως τοῦ ὑψίστου καὶ ᾠκοδομήθη εἰς πάσας τὰς γενεὰς τοῦ αἰῶνος

11 ἐγὼ δὲ συνετήρησα τὴν ψυχήν μου μὴ φαγεῖν
12 καθότι ἐμεμνήμην τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ψυχῇ μου
13 καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ ὕψιστος χάριν καὶ μορφὴν ἐνώπιον Ενεμεσσαρου καὶ ἤμην αὐτοῦ ἀγοραστής

16 καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ενεμεσσαρου ἐλεημοσύνας πολλὰς ἐποίουν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου
17 τοὺς ἄρτους μου ἐδίδουν τοῖς πεινῶσιν καὶ τὰ ἱμάτιά μου τοῖς γυμνοῖς καὶ εἴ τινα ἐκ τοῦ γένους μου ἐθεώρουν τεθνηκότα καὶ ἐρριμμένον ὀπίσω τοῦ τείχους Νινευη ἔθαπτον αὐτόν

18 καὶ εἴ τινα ἀπέκτεινεν Σενναχηριμ ὁ βασιλεύς ὅτε ἦλθεν φεύγων ἐκ τῆς Ιουδαίας ἔθαψα αὐτοὺς κλέπτων πολλοὺς γὰρ ἀπέκτεινεν ἐν τῷ θυμῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐζητήθη ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως τὰ σώματα καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη
19 πορευθεὶς δὲ εἷς τῶν ἐν Νινευη ὑπέδειξε τῷ βασιλεῖ περὶ ἐμοῦ ὅτι θάπτω αὐτούς καὶ ἐκρύβην ἐπιγνοὺς δὲ ὅτι ζητοῦμαι ἀποθανεῖν φοβηθεὶς ἀνεχώρησα
20 καὶ διηρπάγη πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντά μου καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη μοι οὐδὲν πλὴν Αννας τῆς γυναικός μου καὶ Τωβιου τοῦ υἱοῦ μου
21 καὶ οὐ διῆλθον ἡμέραι πεντήκοντα ἕως οὗ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτὸν οἱ δύο υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τὰ ὄρη Αραρατ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Σαχερδονος ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔταξεν Αχιαχαρον τὸν Αναηλ υἱὸν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἐκλογιστίαν τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν διοίκησιν
22 καὶ ἠξίωσεν Αχιαχαρος περὶ ἐμοῦ καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Νινευη Αχιαχαρος δὲ ἦν ὁ οἰνοχόος καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ δακτυλίου καὶ διοικητὴς καὶ ἐκλογιστής καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ὁ Σαχερδονος ἐκ δευτέρας ἦν δὲ ἐξάδελφός μου
