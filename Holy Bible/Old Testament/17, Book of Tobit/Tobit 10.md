# Book of Tobit 10 (RSVCE)

### Anxiety of the Parents
1 Now his father Tobit was counting each day, and when the days for the journey had expired and they did not arrive,
2 he said, “Is it possible that he has been detained? Or is it possible that Gabʹael has died and there is no one to give him the money?”
3 And he was greatly distressed.
4 And his wife said to him, “The lad has perished; his long delay proves it.” Then she began to mourn for him, and said,
5 “Am I not distressed, my child, that I let you go, you who are the light of my eyes?”
6 But Tobit said to her, “Be still and stop worrying; he is well.”
### Tobias and Sarah Start for Home
7 And she answered him, “Be still and stop deceiving me; my child has perished.” And she went out every day to the road by which they had left; she ate nothing in the daytime, and throughout the nights she never stopped mourning for her son Tobiʹas, until the fourteen days of the wedding feast had expired which Ragʹuel had sworn that he should spend there. At that time Tobiʹas said to Ragʹuel, “Send me back, for my father and mother have given up hope of ever seeing me again.”
8 But his father-in-law said to him, “Stay with me, and I will send messengers to your father, and they will inform him how things are with you.”
9 Tobiʹas replied, “No, send me back to my father.”
10 So Ragʹuel arose and gave him his wife Sarah and half of his property in slaves, cattle, and money.
11 And when he had blessed them he sent them away, saying, “The God of heaven will prosper you, my children, before I die.”
12 He said also to his daughter, “Honor your father-in-law and your mother-in-law; they are now your parents. Let me hear a good report of you.” And he kissed her. And Edna said to Tobiʹas, “The Lord of heaven bring you back safely, dear brother, and grant me to see your children by my daughter Sarah, that I may rejoice before the Lord. See, I am entrusting my daughter to you; do nothing to grieve her.”


# Liber Tobiae 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Cum vero moras faceret Tobias, causa nuptiarum, sollicitus erat pater ejus Tobias, dicens: Putas quare moratur filius meus, aut quare detentus est ibi?
2 Putasne Gabelus mortuus est, et nemo reddet illi pecuniam?
3 Cœpit autem contristari nimis ipse, et Anna uxor ejus cum eo: et cœperunt ambo simul flere, eo quod die statuto minime reverteretur filius eorum ad eos.
4 Flebat igitur mater ejus irremediabilibus lacrimis, atque dicebat: Heu, heu me, fili mi! ut quid te misimus peregrinari, lumen oculorum nostrorum, baculum senectutis nostræ, solatium vitæ nostræ, spem posteritatis nostræ?
5 omnia simul in te uno habentes, te non debuimus dimittere a nobis.
6 Cui dicebat Tobias: Tace, et noli turbari: sanus est filius noster: satis fidelis est vir ille, cum quo misimus eum.
7 Illa autem nullo modo consolari poterat, sed quotidie exiliens circumspiciebat, et circuibat vias omnes per quas spes remeandi videbatur, ut procul videret eum, si fieri posset, venientem.

8 At vero Raguel dicebat ad generum suum: Mane hic, et ego mittam nuntium salutis de te ad Tobiam patrem tuum.
9 Cui Tobias ait: Ego novi quia pater meus et mater mea modo dies computant, et cruciatur spiritus eorum in ipsis.
10 Cumque verbis multis rogaret Raguel Tobiam, et ille eum nulla ratione vellet audire, tradidit ei Saram, et dimidiam partem omnis substantiæ suæ in pueris, in puellis, in pecudibus, in camelis, et in vaccis, et in pecunia multa: et salvum atque gaudentem dimisit eum a se,
11 dicens: Angelus Domini sanctus sit in itinere vestro, perducatque vos incolumes, et inveniatis omnia recte circa parentes vestros, et videant oculi mei filios vestros priusquam moriar.
12 Et apprehendentes parentes filiam suam, osculati sunt eam: et dimiserunt ire,
13 monentes eam honorare soceros, diligere maritum, regere familiam, gubernare domum, et seipsam irreprehensibilem exhibere.


# Τωβίτ 10 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ Τωβιτ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἐλογίζετο ἑκάστης ἡμέρας καὶ ὡς ἐπληρώθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς πορείας καὶ οὐκ ἤρχοντο
2 εἶπεν μήποτε κατῄσχυνται ἢ μήποτε ἀπέθανεν Γαβαηλ καὶ οὐδεὶς δίδωσιν αὐτῷ τὸ ἀργύριον
3 καὶ ἐλυπεῖτο λίαν
4 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ἡ γυνή ἀπώλετο τὸ παιδίον διότι κεχρόνικεν καὶ ἤρξατο θρηνεῖν αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν
5 οὐ μέλει μοι τέκνον ὅτι ἀφῆκά σε τὸ φῶς τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου
6 καὶ Τωβιτ λέγει αὐτῇ σίγα μὴ λόγον ἔχε ὑγιαίνει
7 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ σίγα μὴ πλάνα με ἀπώλετο τὸ παιδίον μου καὶ ἐπορεύετο κα{Q'} ἡμέραν εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ἔξω οἵας ἀπῆλθεν ἡμέρας τε ἄρτον οὐκ ἤσθιεν τὰς δὲ νύκτας οὐ διελίμπανεν θρηνοῦσα Τωβιαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς ἕως οὗ συνετελέσθησαν αἱ δέκα τέσσαρες ἡμέραι τοῦ γάμου ἃς ὤμοσεν Ραγουηλ ποιῆσαι αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ εἶπεν δὲ Τωβιας τῷ Ραγουηλ

8 ἐξαπόστειλόν με ὅτι ὁ πατήρ μου καὶ ἡ μήτηρ μου οὐκέτι ἐλπίζουσιν ὄψεσθαί με
9 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ πενθερὸς αὐτοῦ μεῖνον πα{R'} ἐμοί κἀγὼ ἐξαποστελῶ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ δηλώσουσιν αὐτῷ τὰ κατὰ σέ
10 καὶ Τωβιας λέγει οὐχί ἀλλὰ ἐξαπόστειλόν με πρὸς τὸν πατέρα μου
11 ἀναστὰς δὲ Ραγουηλ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ Σαρραν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ ἥμισυ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων σώματα καὶ κτήνη καὶ ἀργύριον
12 καὶ εὐλογήσας αὐτοὺς ἐξαπέστειλεν λέγων εὐοδώσει ὑμᾶς τέκνα ὁ θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πρὸ τοῦ με ἀποθανεῖν
13 καὶ εἶπεν τῇ θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ τίμα τοὺς πενθερούς σου αὐτοὶ νῦν γονεῖς σού εἰσιν ἀκούσαιμί σου ἀκοὴν καλήν καὶ ἐφίλησεν αὐτήν καὶ Εδνα εἶπεν πρὸς Τωβιαν ἄδελφε ἀγαπητέ ἀποκαταστήσαι σε ὁ κύριος τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ δῴη μοι ἰδεῖν σου παιδία ἐκ Σαρρας τῆς θυγατρός μου ἵνα εὐφρανθῶ ἐνώπιον τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ἰδοὺ παρατίθεμαί σοι τὴν θυγατέρα μου ἐν παρακαταθήκῃ μὴ λυπήσῃς αὐτήν
