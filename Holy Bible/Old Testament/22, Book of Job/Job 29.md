# Book of Job 29 (RSVCE)

### Job Finishes His Defense
1 And Job again took up his discourse, and said:
2 “Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me;
3 when his lamp shone upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness;
4 as I was in my autumn days, when the friendship of God was upon my tent;
5 when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
6 when my steps were washed with milk, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
7 When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square,
8 the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose and stood;
9 the princes refrained from talking, and laid their hand on their mouth;
10 the voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
11 When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved;
12 because I delivered the poor who cried, and the fatherless who had none to help him.
13 The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.
15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame.
16 I was a father to the poor, and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know.
17 I broke the fangs of the unrighteous, and made him drop his prey from his teeth.
18 Then I thought, ‘I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand,
19 my roots spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches,
20 my glory fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.’
21 “Men listened to me, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel.
22 After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them.
23 They waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouths as for the spring rain.
24 I smiled on them when they had no confidence; and the light of my countenance they did not cast down.
25 I chose their way, and sat as chief, and I dwelt like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners.


# Liber Job 29 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Addidit quoque Job, assumens parabolam suam, et dixit:
2 Quis mihi tribuat ut sim juxta menses pristinos,secundum dies quibus Deus custodiebat me?
3 Quando splendebat lucerna ejus super caput meum,et ad lumen ejus ambulabam in tenebris:
4 sicut fui in diebus adolescentiæ meæ,quando secreto Deus erat in tabernaculo meo:
5 quando erat Omnipotens mecum,et in circuitu meo pueri mei:
6 quando lavabam pedes meos butyro,et petra fundebat mihi rivos olei:
7 quando procedebam ad portam civitatis,et in platea parabant cathedram mihi.
8 Videbant me juvenes, et abscondebantur:et senes assurgentes stabant.
9 Principes cessabant loqui,et digitum superponebant ori suo.
10 Vocem suam cohibebant duces,et lingua eorum gutturi suo adhærebat.

11 Auris audiens beatificabat me,et oculus videns testimonium reddebat mihi:
12 eo quod liberassem pauperem vociferantem,et pupillum cui non esset adjutor.
13 Benedictio perituri super me veniebat,et cor viduæ consolatus sum.
14 Justitia indutus sum,et vestivi me, sicut vestimento et diademate, judicio meo.
15 Oculus fui cæco, et pes claudo.
16 Pater eram pauperum,et causam quam nesciebam diligentissime investigabam.
17 Conterebam molas iniqui,et de dentibus illius auferebam prædam.

18 Dicebamque: In nidulo meo moriar,et sicut palma multiplicabo dies.
19 Radix mea aperta est secus aquas,et ros morabitur in messione mea.
20 Gloria mea semper innovabitur,et arcus meus in manu mea instaurabitur.
21 Qui me audiebant, expectabant sententiam,et intenti tacebant ad consilium meum.
22 Verbis meis addere nihil audebant,et super illos stillabat eloquium meum.
23 Expectabant me sicut pluviam,et os suum aperiebant quasi ad imbrem serotinum.
24 Siquando ridebam ad eos, non credebant:et lux vultus mei non cadebat in terram.
25 Si voluissem ire ad eos, sedebam primus:cumque sederem quasi rex, circumstante exercitu,eram tamen mœrentium consolator.


# Ἰώβ 29 (Septuagint)

1 ἔτι δὲ προσθεὶς Ιωβ εἶπεν τῷ προοιμίῳ
2 τίς ἄν με θείη κατὰ μῆνα ἔμπροσθεν ἡμερῶν ὧν με ὁ θεὸς ἐφύλαξεν
3 ὡς ὅτε ηὔγει ὁ λύχνος αὐτοῦ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς μου ὅτε τῷ φωτὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπορευόμην ἐν σκότει
4 ὅτε ἤμην ἐπιβρίθων ὁδοῖς ὅτε ὁ θεὸς ἐπισκοπὴν ἐποιεῖτο τοῦ οἴκου μου
5 ὅτε ἤμην ὑλώδης λίαν κύκλῳ δέ μου οἱ παῖδες
6 ὅτε ἐχέοντό μου αἱ ὁδοὶ βουτύρῳ τὰ δὲ ὄρη μου ἐχέοντο γάλακτι
7 ὅτε ἐξεπορευόμην ὄρθριος ἐν πόλει ἐν δὲ πλατείαις ἐτίθετό μου ὁ δίφρος
8 ἰδόντες με νεανίσκοι ἐκρύβησαν πρεσβῦται δὲ πάντες ἔστησαν
9 ἁδροὶ δὲ ἐπαύσαντο λαλοῦντες δάκτυλον ἐπιθέντες ἐπὶ στόματι
10 οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες ἐμακάρισάν με καὶ γλῶσσα αὐτῶν τῷ λάρυγγι αὐτῶν ἐκολλήθη

11 ὅτι οὖς ἤκουσεν καὶ ἐμακάρισέν με ὀφθαλμὸς δὲ ἰδών με ἐξέκλινεν
12 διέσωσα γὰρ πτωχὸν ἐκ χειρὸς δυνάστου καὶ ὀρφανῷ ᾧ οὐκ ἦν βοηθός ἐβοήθησα
13 εὐλογία ἀπολλυμένου ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ ἔλθοι στόμα δὲ χήρας με εὐλόγησεν
14 δικαιοσύνην δὲ ἐνεδεδύκειν ἠμφιασάμην δὲ κρίμα ἴσα διπλοΐδι
15 ὀφθαλμὸς ἤμην τυφλῶν ποὺς δὲ χωλῶν
16 ἐγὼ ἤμην πατὴρ ἀδυνάτων δίκην δέ ἣν οὐκ ᾔδειν ἐξιχνίασα
17 συνέτριψα δὲ μύλας ἀδίκων ἐκ δὲ μέσου τῶν ὀδόντων αὐτῶν ἅρπαγμα ἐξέσπασα

18 εἶπα δέ ἡ ἡλικία μου γηράσει ὥσπερ στέλεχος φοίνικος πολὺν χρόνον βιώσω
19 ἡ ῥίζα μου διήνοικται ἐπὶ ὕδατος καὶ δρόσος αὐλισθήσεται ἐν τῷ θερισμῷ μου
20 ἡ δόξα μου καινὴ με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ τὸ τόξον μου ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ πορεύσεται
21 ἐμοῦ ἀκούσαντες προσέσχον ἐσιώπησαν δὲ ἐπὶ τῇ ἐμῇ βουλῇ
22 ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ ἐμῷ ῥήματι οὐ προσέθεντο περιχαρεῖς δὲ ἐγίνοντο ὁπόταν αὐτοῖς ἐλάλουν
23 ὥσπερ γῆ διψῶσα προσδεχομένη τὸν ὑετόν οὕτως οὗτοι τὴν ἐμὴν λαλιάν
24 ἐὰν γελάσω πρὸς αὐτούς οὐ μὴ πιστεύσωσιν καὶ φῶς τοῦ προσώπου μου οὐκ ἀπέπιπτεν
25 ἐξελεξάμην ὁδὸν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐκάθισα ἄρχων καὶ κατεσκήνουν ὡσεὶ βασιλεὺς ἐν μονοζώνοις ὃν τρόπον παθεινοὺς παρακαλῶν
