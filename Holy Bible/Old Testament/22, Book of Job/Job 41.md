# Book of Job 41 (RSVCE)

1 “Can you draw out Leviʹathan with a fishhook, or press down his tongue with a cord?
2 Can you put a rope in his nose, or pierce his jaw with a hook?
3 Will he make many supplications to you? Will he speak to you soft words?
4 Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant for ever?
5 Will you play with him as with a bird, or will you put him on leash for your maidens?
6 Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?
7 Can you fill his skin with harpoons, or his head with fishing spears?
8 Lay hands on him; think of the battle; you will not do it again!
9 Behold, the hope of a man is disappointed; he is laid low even at the sight of him.
10 No one is so fierce that he dares to stir him up. Who then is he that can stand before me?
11 Who has given to me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine.
12 “I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, or his mighty strength, or his goodly frame.
13 Who can strip off his outer garment? Who can penetrate his double coat of mail?b
14 Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.
15 His back is made of rows of shields, shut up closely as with a seal.
16 One is so near to another that no air can come between them.
17 They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated.
18 His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.
19 Out of his mouth go flaming torches; sparks of fire leap forth.
20 Out of his nostrils comes forth smoke, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.
21 His breath kindles coals, and a flame comes forth from his mouth.
22 In his neck abides strength, and terror dances before him.
23 The folds of his flesh cleave together, firmly cast upon him and immovable.
24 His heart is hard as a stone, hard as the nether millstone.
25 When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid; at the crashing they are beside themselves.
26 Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail; nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
27 He counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.
28 The arrow cannot make him flee; for him slingstones are turned to stubble.
29 Clubs are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rattle of javelins.
30 His underparts are like sharp potsherds; he spreads himself like a threshing sledge on the mire.
31 He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
32 Behind him he leaves a shining wake; one would think the deep to be hoary.
33 Upon earth there is not his like, a creature without fear.
34 He beholds everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride.”


# Liber Job 41 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Non quasi crudelis suscitabo eum:quis enim resistere potest vultui meo?
2 Quis ante dedit mihi, ut reddam ei?omnia quæ sub cælo sunt, mea sunt.
3 Non parcam ei, et verbis potentibus,et ad deprecandum compositis.

4 Quis revelabit faciem indumenti ejus?et in medium oris ejus quis intrabit?
5 Portas vultus ejus quis aperiet?per gyrum dentium ejus formido.
6 Corpus illius quasi scuta fusilia,compactum squamis se prementibus.
7 Una uni conjungitur,et ne spiraculum quidem incedit per eas.
8 Una alteri adhærebit,et tenentes se nequaquam separabuntur.
9 Sternutatio ejus splendor ignis,et oculi ejus ut palpebræ diluculi.
10 De ore ejus lampades procedunt,sicut tædæ ignis accensæ.
11 De naribus ejus procedit fumus,sicut ollæ succensæ atque ferventis.
12 Halitus ejus prunas ardere facit,et flamma de ore ejus egreditur.
13 In collo ejus morabitur fortitudo,et faciem ejus præcedit egestas.
14 Membra carnium ejus cohærentia sibi:mittet contra eum fulmina, et ad locum alium non ferentur.
15 Cor ejus indurabitur tamquam lapis,et stringetur quasi malleatoris incus.
16 Cum sublatus fuerit, timebunt angeli,et territi purgabuntur.
17 Cum apprehenderit eum gladius, subsistere non poterit,neque hasta, neque thorax:
18 reputabit enim quasi paleas ferrum,et quasi lignum putridum æs.
19 Non fugabit eum vir sagittarius:in stipulam versi sunt ei lapides fundæ.
20 Quasi stipulam æstimabit malleum,et deridebit vibrantem hastam.
21 Sub ipso erunt radii solis,et sternet sibi aurum quasi lutum.
22 Fervescere faciet quasi ollam profundum mare,et ponet quasi cum unguenta bulliunt.
23 Post eum lucebit semita:æstimabit abyssum quasi senescentem.

24 Non est super terram potestas quæ comparetur ei,qui factus est ut nullum timeret.
25 Omne sublime videt:ipse est rex super universos filios superbiæ.


# Ἰώβ 41 (Septuagint)

1 οὐ δέδοικας ὅτι ἡτοίμασταί μοι τίς γάρ ἐστιν ὁ ἐμοὶ ἀντιστάς
2 ἢ τίς ἀντιστήσεταί μοι καὶ ὑπομενεῖ εἰ πᾶσα ἡ ὑ{P'} οὐρανὸν ἐμή ἐστιν
3 οὐ σιωπήσομαι δ{I'} αὐτόν καὶ λόγον δυνάμεως ἐλεήσει τὸν ἴσον αὐτοῦ

4 τίς ἀποκαλύψει πρόσωπον ἐνδύσεως αὐτοῦ εἰς δὲ πτύξιν θώρακος αὐτοῦ τίς ἂν εἰσέλθοι
5 πύλας προσώπου αὐτοῦ τίς ἀνοίξει κύκλῳ ὀδόντων αὐτοῦ φόβος
6 τὰ ἔγκατα αὐτοῦ ἀσπίδες χάλκειαι σύνδεσμος δὲ αὐτοῦ ὥσπερ σμιρίτης λίθος
7 εἷς τοῦ ἑνὸς κολλῶνται πνεῦμα δὲ οὐ μὴ διέλθῃ αὐτόν
8 ἀνὴρ τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ προσκολληθήσεται συνέχονται καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποσπασθῶσιν
9 ἐν πταρμῷ αὐτοῦ ἐπιφαύσκεται φέγγος οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ εἶδος ἑωσφόρου
10 ἐκ στόματος αὐτοῦ ἐκπορεύονται λαμπάδες καιόμεναι καὶ διαρριπτοῦνται ἐσχάραι πυρός
11 ἐκ μυκτήρων αὐτοῦ ἐκπορεύεται καπνὸς καμίνου καιομένης πυρὶ ἀνθράκων
12 ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ ἄνθρακες φλὸξ δὲ ἐκ στόματος αὐτοῦ ἐκπορεύεται
13 ἐν δὲ τραχήλῳ αὐτοῦ αὐλίζεται δύναμις ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ τρέχει ἀπώλεια
14 σάρκες δὲ σώματος αὐτοῦ κεκόλληνται καταχέει ἐ{P'} αὐτόν οὐ σαλευθήσεται
15 ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ πέπηγεν ὡς λίθος ἕστηκεν δὲ ὥσπερ ἄκμων ἀνήλατος
16 στραφέντος δὲ αὐτοῦ φόβος θηρίοις τετράποσιν ἐπὶ γῆς ἁλλομένοις
17 ἐὰν συναντήσωσιν αὐτῷ λόγχαι οὐδὲν μὴ ποιήσωσιν δόρυ ἐπηρμένον καὶ θώρακα
18 ἥγηται μὲν γὰρ σίδηρον ἄχυρα χαλκὸν δὲ ὥσπερ ξύλον σαθρόν
19 οὐ μὴ τρώσῃ αὐτὸν τόξον χάλκειον ἥγηται μὲν πετροβόλον χόρτον
20 ὡς καλάμη ἐλογίσθησαν σφῦραι καταγελᾷ δὲ σεισμοῦ πυρφόρου
21 ἡ στρωμνὴ αὐτοῦ ὀβελίσκοι ὀξεῖς πᾶς δὲ χρυσὸς θαλάσσης ὑ{P'} αὐτὸν ὥσπερ πηλὸς ἀμύθητος
22 ἀναζεῖ τὴν ἄβυσσον ὥσπερ χαλκεῖον ἥγηται δὲ τὴν θάλασσαν ὥσπερ ἐξάλειπτρον
23 τὸν δὲ τάρταρον τῆς ἀβύσσου ὥσπερ αἰχμάλωτον ἐλογίσατο ἄβυσσον εἰς περίπατον

24 οὐκ ἔστιν οὐδὲν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ὅμοιον αὐτῷ πεποιημένον ἐγκαταπαίζεσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀγγέλων μου
25 πᾶν ὑψηλὸν ὁρᾷ αὐτὸς δὲ βασιλεὺς πάντων τῶν ἐν τοῖς ὕδασιν
