# Book of Job 1 (RSVCE)

### Job and His Family
1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God, and turned away from evil.
2 There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
3 He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and very many servants; so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.
4 His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each on his day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
5 And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually.
### Attack on Job’s Character
6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before theLord, and Satan also came among them.
7 TheLordsaid to Satan, “Whence have you come?” Satan answered theLord, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.”
8 And theLordsaid to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?”
9 Then Satan answered theLord, “Does Job fear God for nought?
10 Hast thou not put a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
11 But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse thee to thy face.”
12 And theLordsaid to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power; only upon himself do not put forth your hand.” So Satan went forth from the presence of theLord.
### Job Loses Property and Children
13 Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house;
14 and there came a messenger to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them;
15 and the Sabeʹans fell upon them and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
16 While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
17 While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, “The Chaldeʹans formed three companies, and made a raid upon the camels and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
18 While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house;
19 and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
20 Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped.
21 And he said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return; theLordgave, and theLordhas taken away; blessed be the name of theLord.”
22 In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.


# Liber Job 1 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Vir erat in terra Hus, nomine Job: et erat vir ille simplex, et rectus, ac timens Deum, et recedens a malo.
2 Natique sunt ei septem filii, et tres filiæ.
3 Et fuit possessio ejus septem millia ovium, et tria millia camelorum, quingenta quoque juga boum, et quingentæ asinæ, ac familia multa nimis: eratque vir ille magnus inter omnes orientales.
4 Et ibant filii ejus, et faciebant convivium per domos, unusquisque in die suo. Et mittentes vocabant tres sorores suas, ut comederent et biberent cum eis.
5 Cumque in orbem transissent dies convivii, mittebat ad eos Job, et sanctificabat illos: consurgensque diluculo, offerebat holocausta pro singulis. Dicebat enim: Ne forte peccaverint filii mei, et benedixerint Deo in cordibus suis. Sic faciebat Job cunctis diebus.

6 Quadam autem die, cum venissent filii Dei ut assisterent coram Domino, affuit inter eos etiam Satan.
7 Cui dixit Dominus: Unde venis? Qui respondens, ait: Circuivi terram, et perambulavi eam.
8 Dixitque Dominus ad eum: Numquid considerasti servum meum Job, quod non sit ei similis in terra, homo simplex et rectus, ac timens Deum, et recedens a malo?
9 Cui respondens Satan, ait: Numquid Job frustra timet Deum?
10 nonne tu vallasti eum, ac domum ejus, universamque substantiam per circuitum; operibus manuum ejus benedixisti, et possessio ejus crevit in terra?
11 sed extende paululum manum tuam et tange cuncta quæ possidet, nisi in faciem benedixerit tibi.
12 Dixit ergo Dominus ad Satan: Ecce universa quæ habet in manu tua sunt: tantum in eum ne extendas manum tuam. Egressusque est Satan a facie Domini.

13 Cum autem quadam die filii et filiæ ejus comederent et biberent vinum in domo fratris sui primogeniti,
14 nuntius venit ad Job, qui diceret: Boves arabant, et asinæ pascebantur juxta eos:
15 et irruerunt Sabæi, tuleruntque omnia, et pueros percusserunt gladio: et evasi ego solus, ut nuntiarem tibi.
16 Cumque adhuc ille loqueretur, venit alter, et dixit: Ignis Dei cecidit e cælo, et tactas oves puerosque consumpsit: et effugi ego solus, ut nuntiarem tibi.
17 Sed et illo adhuc loquente, venit alius, et dixit: Chaldæi fecerunt tres turmas, et invaserunt camelos, et tulerunt eos, necnon et pueros percusserunt gladio: et ego fugi solus, ut nuntiarem tibi.
18 Adhuc loquebatur ille, et ecce alius intravit, et dixit: Filiis tuis et filiabus vescentibus et bibentibus vinum in domo fratris sui primogeniti,
19 repente ventus vehemens irruit a regione deserti, et concussit quatuor angulos domus: quæ corruens oppressit liberos tuos, et mortui sunt: et effugi ego solus, ut nuntiarem tibi.

20 Tunc surrexit Job, et scidit vestimenta sua: et tonso capite corruens in terram, adoravit,
21 et dixit: Nudus egressus sum de utero matris meæ, et nudus revertar illuc. Dominus dedit, Dominus abstulit; sicut Domino placuit, ita factum est. Sit nomen Domini benedictum.
22 In omnibus his non peccavit Job labiis suis, neque stultum quid contra Deum locutus est.


# Ἰώβ 1 (Septuagint)

1 ἄνθρωπός τις ἦν ἐν χώρᾳ τῇ Αυσίτιδι ᾧ ὄνομα Ιωβ καὶ ἦν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος ἀληθινός ἄμεμπτος δίκαιος θεοσεβής ἀπεχόμενος ἀπὸ παντὸς πονηροῦ πράγματος
2 ἐγένοντο δὲ αὐτῷ υἱοὶ ἑπτὰ καὶ θυγατέρες τρεῖς
3 καὶ ἦν τὰ κτήνη αὐτοῦ πρόβατα ἑπτακισχίλια κάμηλοι τρισχίλιαι ζεύγη βοῶν πεντακόσια ὄνοι θήλειαι νομάδες πεντακόσιαι καὶ ὑπηρεσία πολλὴ σφόδρα καὶ ἔργα μεγάλα ἦν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἦν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος εὐγενὴς τῶν ἀ{F'} ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν
4 συμπορευόμενοι δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἐποιοῦσαν πότον κα{Q'} ἑκάστην ἡμέραν συμπαραλαμβάνοντες ἅμα καὶ τὰς τρεῖς ἀδελφὰς αὐτῶν ἐσθίειν καὶ πίνειν με{T'} αὐτῶν
5 καὶ ὡς ἂν συνετελέσθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ πότου ἀπέστελλεν Ιωβ καὶ ἐκαθάριζεν αὐτοὺς ἀνιστάμενος τὸ πρωὶ καὶ προσέφερεν περὶ αὐτῶν θυσίας κατὰ τὸν ἀριθμὸν αὐτῶν καὶ μόσχον ἕνα περὶ ἁμαρτίας περὶ τῶν ψυχῶν αὐτῶν ἔλεγεν γὰρ Ιωβ μήποτε οἱ υἱοί μου ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ αὐτῶν κακὰ ἐνενόησαν πρὸς θεόν οὕτως οὖν ἐποίει Ιωβ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας

6 καὶ ὡς ἐγένετο ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη καὶ ἰδοὺ ἦλθον οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ θεοῦ παραστῆναι ἐνώπιον τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ὁ διάβολος ἦλθεν με{T'} αὐτῶν
7 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ κύριος τῷ διαβόλῳ πόθεν παραγέγονας καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ διάβολος τῷ κυρίῳ εἶπεν περιελθὼν τὴν γῆν καὶ ἐμπεριπατήσας τὴν ὑ{P'} οὐρανὸν πάρειμι
8 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ κύριος προσέσχες τῇ διανοίᾳ σου κατὰ τοῦ παιδός μου Ιωβ ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν κα{T'} αὐτὸν τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἄνθρωπος ἄμεμπτος ἀληθινός θεοσεβής ἀπεχόμενος ἀπὸ παντὸς πονηροῦ πράγματος
9 ἀπεκρίθη δὲ ὁ διάβολος καὶ εἶπεν ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου μὴ δωρεὰν σέβεται Ιωβ τὸν θεόν
10 οὐ σὺ περιέφραξας τὰ ἔξω αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ ἔσω τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ ἔξω πάντων τῶν ὄντων αὐτῷ κύκλῳ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ εὐλόγησας καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτοῦ πολλὰ ἐποίησας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
11 ἀλλὰ ἀπόστειλον τὴν χεῖρά σου καὶ ἅψαι πάντων ὧν ἔχει εἰ μὴν εἰς πρόσωπόν σε εὐλογήσει
12 τότε εἶπεν ὁ κύριος τῷ διαβόλῳ ἰδοὺ πάντα ὅσα ἔστιν αὐτῷ δίδωμι ἐν τῇ χειρί σου ἀλλὰ αὐτοῦ μὴ ἅψῃ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ διάβολος παρὰ τοῦ κυρίου

13 καὶ ἦν ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη οἱ υἱοὶ Ιωβ καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτοῦ ἔπινον οἶνον ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτῶν τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου
14 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄγγελος ἦλθεν πρὸς Ιωβ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τὰ ζεύγη τῶν βοῶν ἠροτρία καὶ αἱ θήλειαι ὄνοι ἐβόσκοντο ἐχόμεναι αὐτῶν
15 καὶ ἐλθόντες οἱ αἰχμαλωτεύοντες ᾐχμαλώτευσαν αὐτὰς καὶ τοὺς παῖδας ἀπέκτειναν ἐν μαχαίραις σωθεὶς δὲ ἐγὼ μόνος ἦλθον τοῦ ἀπαγγεῖλαί σοι
16 ἔτι τούτου λαλοῦντος ἦλθεν ἕτερος ἄγγελος καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Ιωβ πῦρ ἔπεσεν ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ κατέκαυσεν τὰ πρόβατα καὶ τοὺς ποιμένας κατέφαγεν ὁμοίως καὶ σωθεὶς ἐγὼ μόνος ἦλθον τοῦ ἀπαγγεῖλαί σοι
17 ἔτι τούτου λαλοῦντος ἦλθεν ἕτερος ἄγγελος καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Ιωβ οἱ ἱππεῖς ἐποίησαν ἡμῖν κεφαλὰς τρεῖς καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν τὰς καμήλους καὶ ᾐχμαλώτευσαν αὐτὰς καὶ τοὺς παῖδας ἀπέκτειναν ἐν μαχαίραις ἐσώθην δὲ ἐγὼ μόνος καὶ ἦλθον τοῦ ἀπαγγεῖλαί σοι
18 ἔτι τούτου λαλοῦντος ἄλλος ἄγγελος ἔρχεται λέγων τῷ Ιωβ τῶν υἱῶν σου καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων σου ἐσθιόντων καὶ πινόντων παρὰ τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτῶν τῷ πρεσβυτέρῳ
19 ἐξαίφνης πνεῦμα μέγα ἐπῆλθεν ἐκ τῆς ἐρήμου καὶ ἥψατο τῶν τεσσάρων γωνιῶν τῆς οἰκίας καὶ ἔπεσεν ἡ οἰκία ἐπὶ τὰ παιδία σου καὶ ἐτελεύτησαν ἐσώθην δὲ ἐγὼ μόνος καὶ ἦλθον τοῦ ἀπαγγεῖλαί σοι

20 οὕτως ἀναστὰς Ιωβ διέρρηξεν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκείρατο τὴν κόμην τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ πεσὼν χαμαὶ προσεκύνησεν καὶ εἶπεν
21 αὐτὸς γυμνὸς ἐξῆλθον ἐκ κοιλίας μητρός μου γυμνὸς καὶ ἀπελεύσομαι ἐκεῖ ὁ κύριος ἔδωκεν ὁ κύριος ἀφείλατο ὡς τῷ κυρίῳ ἔδοξεν οὕτως καὶ ἐγένετο εἴη τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου εὐλογημένον
22 ἐν τούτοις πᾶσιν τοῖς συμβεβηκόσιν αὐτῷ οὐδὲν ἥμαρτεν Ιωβ ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκεν ἀφροσύνην τῷ θεῷ
