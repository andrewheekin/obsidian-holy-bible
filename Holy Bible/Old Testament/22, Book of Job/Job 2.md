# Book of Job 2 (RSVCE)

### Attack on Job’s Health
1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before theLord, and Satan also came among them to present himself before theLord.
2 And theLordsaid to Satan, “Whence have you come?” Satan answered theLord, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.”
3 And theLordsaid to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds fast his integrity, although you moved me against him, to destroy him without cause.”
4 Then Satan answered theLord, “Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.
5 But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.”
6 And theLordsaid to Satan, “Behold, he is in your power; only spare his life.”
7 So Satan went forth from the presence of theLord, and afflicted Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
8 And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and sat among the ashes.
9 Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God, and die.”
10 But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
### Job’s Three Friends
11 Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliʹphaz the Teʹmanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naʹamathite. They made an appointment together to come to condole with him and comfort him.
12 And when they saw him from afar, they did not recognize him; and they raised their voices and wept; and they rent their robes and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
13 And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.


# Liber Job 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem, cum quadam die venissent filii Dei, et starent coram Domino, venisset quoque Satan inter eos, et staret in conspectu ejus,
2 ut diceret Dominus ad Satan: Unde venis? Qui respondens ait: Circuivi terram, et perambulavi eam.
3 Et dixit Dominus ad Satan: Numquid considerasti servum meum Job, quod non sit ei similis in terra, vir simplex et rectus, ac timens Deum, et recedens a malo, et adhuc retinens innocentiam? tu autem commovisti me adversus eum, ut affligerem eum frustra.
4 Cui respondens Satan, ait: Pellem pro pelle, et cuncta quæ habet homo dabit pro anima sua;
5 alioquin mitte manum tuam, et tange os ejus et carnem, et tunc videbis quod in faciem benedicat tibi.
6 Dixit ergo Dominus ad Satan: Ecce in manu tua est: verumtamen animam illius serva.
7 Egressus igitur Satan a facie Domini, percussit Job ulcere pessimo, a planta pedis usque ad verticem ejus;
8 qui testa saniem radebat, sedens in sterquilinio.
9 Dixit autem illi uxor sua: Adhuc tu permanes in simplicitate tua? Benedic Deo, et morere.
10 Qui ait ad illam: Quasi una de stultis mulieribus locuta es: si bona suscepimus de manu Dei, mala quare non suscipiamus? In omnibus his non peccavit Job labiis suis.

11 Igitur audientes tres amici Job omne malum quod accidisset ei, venerunt singuli de loco suo, Eliphaz Themanites, et Baldad Suhites, et Sophar Naamathites. Condixerant enim ut pariter venientes visitarent eum, et consolarentur.
12 Cumque elevassent procul oculos suos, non cognoverunt eum, et exclamantes ploraverunt, scissisque vestibus sparserunt pulverem super caput suum in cælum.
13 Et sederunt cum eo in terra septem diebus et septem noctibus: et nemo loquebatur ei verbum: videbant enim dolorem esse vehementem.


# Ἰώβ 2 (Septuagint)

1 ἐγένετο δὲ ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη καὶ ἦλθον οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ θεοῦ παραστῆναι ἔναντι κυρίου καὶ ὁ διάβολος ἦλθεν ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν παραστῆναι ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου
2 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ κύριος τῷ διαβόλῳ πόθεν σὺ ἔρχῃ τότε εἶπεν ὁ διάβολος ἐνώπιον τοῦ κυρίου διαπορευθεὶς τὴν ὑ{P'} οὐρανὸν καὶ ἐμπεριπατήσας τὴν σύμπασαν πάρειμι
3 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ κύριος πρὸς τὸν διάβολον προσέσχες οὖν τῷ θεράποντί μου Ιωβ ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν κα{T'} αὐτὸν τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἄνθρωπος ἄκακος ἀληθινός ἄμεμπτος θεοσεβής ἀπεχόμενος ἀπὸ παντὸς κακοῦ ἔτι δὲ ἔχεται ἀκακίας σὺ δὲ εἶπας τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ διὰ κενῆς ἀπολέσαι
4 ὑπολαβὼν δὲ ὁ διάβολος εἶπεν τῷ κυρίῳ δέρμα ὑπὲρ δέρματος ὅσα ὑπάρχει ἀνθρώπῳ ὑπὲρ τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ ἐκτείσει
5 οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλὰ ἀποστείλας τὴν χεῖρά σου ἅψαι τῶν ὀστῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν σαρκῶν αὐτοῦ εἰ μὴν εἰς πρόσωπόν σε εὐλογήσει
6 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ κύριος τῷ διαβόλῳ ἰδοὺ παραδίδωμί σοι αὐτόν μόνον τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ διαφύλαξον
7 ἐξῆλθεν δὲ ὁ διάβολος ἀπὸ τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ἔπαισεν τὸν Ιωβ ἕλκει πονηρῷ ἀπὸ ποδῶν ἕως κεφαλῆς
8 καὶ ἔλαβεν ὄστρακον ἵνα τὸν ἰχῶρα ξύῃ καὶ ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τῆς κοπρίας ἔξω τῆς πόλεως
9 χρόνου δὲ πολλοῦ προβεβηκότος εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ μέχρι τίνος καρτερήσεις λέγων
10 ἰδοὺ ἀναμένω χρόνον ἔτι μικρὸν προσδεχόμενος τὴν ἐλπίδα τῆς σωτηρίας μου

11 ἀκούσαντες δὲ οἱ τρεῖς φίλοι αὐτοῦ τὰ κακὰ πάντα τὰ ἐπελθόντα αὐτῷ παρεγένοντο ἕκαστος ἐκ τῆς ἰδίας χώρας πρὸς αὐτόν Ελιφας ὁ Θαιμανων βασιλεύς Βαλδαδ ὁ Σαυχαίων τύραννος Σωφαρ ὁ Μιναίων βασιλεύς καὶ παρεγένοντο πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁμοθυμαδὸν τοῦ παρακαλέσαι καὶ ἐπισκέψασθαι αὐτόν
12 ἰδόντες δὲ αὐτὸν πόρρωθεν οὐκ ἐπέγνωσαν καὶ βοήσαντες φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ἔκλαυσαν ῥήξαντες ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ στολὴν καὶ καταπασάμενοι γῆν
13 παρεκάθισαν αὐτῷ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας καὶ ἑπτὰ νύκτας καὶ οὐδεὶς αὐτῶν ἐλάλησεν ἑώρων γὰρ τὴν πληγὴν δεινὴν οὖσαν καὶ μεγάλην σφόδρα
