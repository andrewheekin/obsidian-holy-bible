# Book of Job 18 (RSVCE)

### Bildad Speaks: God Punishes the Wicked
1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
2 “How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and then we will speak.
3 Why are we counted as cattle? Why are we stupid in your sight?
4 You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place?
5 “Yea, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire does not shine.
6 The light is dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out.
7 His strong steps are shortened and his own schemes throw him down.
8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks on a pitfall.
9 A trap seizes him by the heel, a snare lays hold of him.
10 A rope is hid for him in the ground, a trap for him in the path.
11 Terrors frighten him on every side, and chase him at his heels.
12 His strength is hunger-bitten, and calamity is ready for his stumbling.
13 By disease his skin is consumed, the first-born of death consumes his limbs.
14 He is torn from the tent in which he trusted, and is brought to the king of terrors.
15 In his tent dwells that which is none of his; brimstone is scattered upon his habitation.
16 His roots dry up beneath, and his branches wither above.
17 His memory perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the street.
18 He is thrust from light into darkness, and driven out of the world.
19 He has no offspring or descendant among his people, and no survivor where he used to live.
20 They of the west are appalled at his day, and horror seizes them of the east.
21 Surely such are the dwellings of the ungodly, such is the place of him who knows not God.”


# Liber Job 18 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Respondens autem Baldad Suhites, dixit:
2 Usque ad quem finem verba jactabitis?intelligite prius, et sic loquamur.
3 Quare reputati sumus ut jumenta,et sorduimus coram vobis?
4 Qui perdis animam tuam in furore tuo,numquid propter te derelinquetur terra,et transferentur rupes de loco suo?

5 Nonne lux impii extinguetur,nec splendebit flamma ignis ejus?
6 Lux obtenebrescet in tabernaculo illius,et lucerna quæ super eum est extinguetur.
7 Arctabuntur gressus virtutis ejus,et præcipitabit eum consilium suum.
8 Immisit enim in rete pedes suos,et in maculis ejus ambulat.
9 Tenebitur planta illius laqueo,et exardescet contra eum sitis.
10 Abscondita est in terra pedica ejus,et decipula illius super semitam.
11 Undique terrebunt eum formidines,et involvent pedes ejus.

12 Attenuetur fame robur ejus,et inedia invadat costas illius.
13 Devoret pulchritudinem cutis ejus;consumat brachia illius primogenita mors.
14 Avellatur de tabernaculo suo fiducia ejus,et calcet super eum, quasi rex, interitus.
15 Habitent in tabernaculo illius socii ejus qui non est;aspergatur in tabernaculo ejus sulphur.
16 Deorsum radices ejus siccentur:sursum autem atteratur messis ejus.
17 Memoria illius pereat de terra,et non celebretur nomen ejus in plateis.
18 Expellet eum de luce in tenebras,et de orbe transferet eum.
19 Non erit semen ejus, neque progenies in populo suo,nec ullæ reliquiæ in regionibus ejus.
20 In die ejus stupebunt novissimi,et primos invadet horror.
21 Hæc sunt ergo tabernacula iniqui,et iste locus ejus qui ignorat Deum.


# Ἰώβ 18 (Septuagint)

1 ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Βαλδαδ ὁ Σαυχίτης λέγει
2 μέχρι τίνος οὐ παύσῃ ἐπίσχες ἵνα καὶ αὐτοὶ λαλήσωμεν
3 διὰ τί ὥσπερ τετράποδα σεσιωπήκαμεν ἐναντίον σου
4 κέχρηταί σοι ὀργή τί γάρ ἐὰν σὺ ἀποθάνῃς ἀοίκητος ἡ ὑ{P'} οὐρανόν ἢ καταστραφήσεται ὄρη ἐκ θεμελίων

5 καὶ φῶς ἀσεβῶν σβεσθήσεται καὶ οὐκ ἀποβήσεται αὐτῶν ἡ φλόξ
6 τὸ φῶς αὐτοῦ σκότος ἐν διαίτῃ ὁ δὲ λύχνος ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ σβεσθήσεται
7 θηρεύσαισαν ἐλάχιστοι τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ σφάλαι δὲ αὐτοῦ ἡ βουλή
8 ἐμβέβληται δὲ ὁ ποὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν παγίδι ἐν δικτύῳ ἑλιχθείη
9 ἔλθοισαν δὲ ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν παγίδες κατισχύσει ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν διψῶντας
10 κέκρυπται ἐν τῇ γῇ σχοινίον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ σύλλημψις αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τρίβων
11 κύκλῳ ὀλέσαισαν αὐτὸν ὀδύναι πολλοὶ δὲ περὶ πόδας αὐτοῦ ἔλθοισαν ἐν λιμῷ στενῷ

12 πτῶμα δὲ αὐτῷ ἡτοίμασται ἐξαίσιον
13 βρωθείησαν αὐτοῦ κλῶνες ποδῶν κατέδεται δὲ τὰ ὡραῖα αὐτοῦ θάνατος
14 ἐκραγείη δὲ ἐκ διαίτης αὐτοῦ ἴασις σχοίη δὲ αὐτὸν ἀνάγκη αἰτίᾳ βασιλικῇ
15 κατασκηνώσει ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ αὐτοῦ ἐν νυκτὶ αὐτοῦ κατασπαρήσονται τὰ εὐπρεπῆ αὐτοῦ θείῳ
16 ὑποκάτωθεν αἱ ῥίζαι αὐτοῦ ξηρανθήσονται καὶ ἐπάνωθεν ἐπιπεσεῖται θερισμὸς αὐτοῦ
17 τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτοῦ ἀπόλοιτο ἐκ γῆς καὶ ὑπάρχει ὄνομα αὐτῷ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐξωτέρω
18 ἀπώσειεν αὐτὸν ἐκ φωτὸς εἰς σκότος
19 οὐκ ἔσται ἐπίγνωστος ἐν λαῷ αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ σεσῳσμένος ἐν τῇ ὑ{P'} οὐρανὸν ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ ἀλ{L'} ἐν τοῖς αὐτοῦ ζήσονται ἕτεροι
20 ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ ἐστέναξαν ἔσχατοι πρώτους δὲ ἔσχεν θαῦμα
21 οὗτοί εἰσιν οἶκοι ἀδίκων οὗτος δὲ ὁ τόπος τῶν μὴ εἰδότων τὸν κύριον
