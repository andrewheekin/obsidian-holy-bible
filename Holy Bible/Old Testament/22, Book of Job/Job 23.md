# Book of Job 23 (RSVCE)

### Job Replies: My Complaint Is Bitter
1 Then Job answered:
2 “Today also my complaint is bitter, hismhand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
3 Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat!
4 I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
5 I would learn what he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.
6 Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; he would give heed to me.
7 There an upright man could reason with him, and I should be acquitted for ever by my judge.
8 “Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him;
9 on the left hand I seek him, but I cannot behold him; Ioturn to the right hand, but I cannot see him.
10 But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
11 My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside.
12 I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured inpmy bosom the words of his mouth.
13 But he is unchangeable and who can turn him? What he desires, that he does.
14 For he will complete what he appoints for me; and many such things are in his mind.
15 Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him.
16 God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;
17 for I am hemmed in by darkness, and thick darkness covers my face.r


# Liber Job 23 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Respondens autem Job, ait:
2 Nunc quoque in amaritudine est sermo meus,et manus plagæ meæ aggravata est super gemitum meum.
3 Quis mihi tribuat ut cognoscam et inveniam illum,et veniam usque ad solium ejus?
4 Ponam coram eo judicium,et os meum replebo increpationibus:
5 ut sciam verba quæ mihi respondeat,et intelligam quid loquatur mihi.
6 Nolo multa fortitudine contendat mecum,nec magnitudinis suæ mole me premat.
7 Proponat æquitatem contra me,et perveniat ad victoriam judicium meum.

8 Si ad orientem iero, non apparet;si ad occidentem, non intelligam eum.
9 Si ad sinistram, quid agam? non apprehendam eum;si me vertam ad dexteram, non videbo illum.
10 Ipse vero scit viam meam,et probavit me quasi aurum quod per ignem transit.
11 Vestigia ejus secutus est pes meus:viam ejus custodivi, et non declinavi ex ea.
12 A mandatis labiorum ejus non recessi,et in sinu meo abscondi verba oris ejus.
13 Ipse enim solus est, et nemo avertere potest cogitationem ejus:et anima ejus quodcumque voluit, hoc fecit.
14 Cum expleverit in me voluntatem suam,et alia multa similia præsto sunt ei.
15 Et idcirco a facie ejus turbatus sum,et considerans eum, timore sollicitor.
16 Deus mollivit cor meum,et Omnipotens conturbavit me.
17 Non enim perii propter imminentes tenebras,nec faciem meam operuit caligo.


# Ἰώβ 23 (Septuagint)

1 ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ιωβ λέγει
2 καὶ δὴ οἶδα ὅτι ἐκ χειρός μου ἡ ἔλεγξίς ἐστιν καὶ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ βαρεῖα γέγονεν ἐ{P'} ἐμῷ στεναγμῷ
3 τίς {D'} ἄρα γνοίη ὅτι εὕροιμι αὐτὸν καὶ ἔλθοιμι εἰς τέλος
4 εἴποιμι δὲ ἐμαυτοῦ κρίμα τὸ δὲ στόμα μου ἐμπλήσαιμι ἐλέγχων
5 γνῴην δὲ ῥήματα ἅ μοι ἐρεῖ αἰσθοίμην δὲ τίνα μοι ἀπαγγελεῖ
6 καὶ εἰ ἐν πολλῇ ἰσχύι ἐπελεύσεταί μοι εἶτα ἐν ἀπειλῇ μοι οὐ χρήσεται
7 ἀλήθεια γὰρ καὶ ἔλεγχος πα{R'} αὐτοῦ ἐξαγάγοι δὲ εἰς τέλος τὸ κρίμα μου

8 εἰς γὰρ πρῶτα πορεύσομαι καὶ οὐκέτι εἰμί τὰ δὲ ἐ{P'} ἐσχάτοις τί οἶδα
9 ἀριστερὰ ποιήσαντος αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐ κατέσχον περιβαλεῖ δεξιά καὶ οὐκ ὄψομαι
10 οἶδεν γὰρ ἤδη ὁδόν μου διέκρινεν δέ με ὥσπερ τὸ χρυσίον
11 ἐξελεύσομαι δὲ ἐν ἐντάλμασιν αὐτοῦ ὁδοὺς γὰρ αὐτοῦ ἐφύλαξα καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκκλίνω
12 ἀπὸ ἐνταλμάτων αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐ μὴ παρέλθω ἐν δὲ κόλπῳ μου ἔκρυψα ῥήματα αὐτοῦ
13 εἰ δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἔκρινεν οὕτως τίς ἐστιν ὁ ἀντειπὼν αὐτῷ ὃ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἠθέλησεν καὶ ἐποίησεν
14 διὰ τοῦτο ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ ἐσπούδακα νουθετούμενος δὲ ἐφρόντισα αὐτοῦ
15 ἐπὶ τούτῳ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ κατασπουδασθῶ κατανοήσω καὶ πτοηθήσομαι ἐξ αὐτοῦ
16 κύριος δὲ ἐμαλάκυνεν τὴν καρδίαν μου ὁ δὲ παντοκράτωρ ἐσπούδασέν με
17 οὐ γὰρ ᾔδειν ὅτι ἐπελεύσεταί μοι σκότος πρὸ προσώπου δέ μου ἐκάλυψεν γνόφος
