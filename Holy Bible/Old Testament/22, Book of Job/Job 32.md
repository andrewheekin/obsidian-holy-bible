# Book of Job 32 (RSVCE)

### Elihu Rebukes Job’s Friends
1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
2 Then Eliʹhu the son of Barʹachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God;
3 he was angry also at Job’s three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong.
4 Now Eliʹhu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.
5 And when Eliʹhu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he became angry.
6 And Eliʹhu the son of Barʹachel the Buzite answered: “I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.
7 I said, ‘Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.’
8 But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand.
9 It is not the old that are wise, nor the aged that understand what is right.
10 Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.’
11 “Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say.
12 I gave you my attention, and, behold, there was none that confuted Job, or that answered his words, among you.
13 Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man.’
14 He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches.
15 “They are discomfited, they answer no more; they have not a word to say.
16 And shall I wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more?
17 I also will give my answer; I also will declare my opinion.
18 For I am full of words, the spirit within me constrains me.
19 Behold, my heart is like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins, it is ready to burst.
20 I must speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.
21 I will not show partiality to any person or use flattery toward any man.
22 For I do not know how to flatter, else would my Maker soon put an end to me.


# Liber Job 32 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Omiserunt autem tres viri isti respondere Job, eo quod justus sibi videretur.
2 Et iratus indignatusque est Eliu filius Barachel Buzites, de cognatione Ram: iratus est autem adversum Job, eo quod justum se esse diceret coram Deo.
3 Porro adversum amicos ejus indignatus est, eo quod non invenissent responsionem rationabilem, sed tantummodo condemnassent Job.
4 Igitur Eliu expectavit Job loquentem, eo quod seniores essent qui loquebantur.
5 Cum autem vidisset quod tres respondere non potuissent, iratus est vehementer.

6 Respondensque Eliu filius Barachel Buzites, dixit:Junior sum tempore, vos autem antiquiores:idcirco, demisso capite,veritus sum vobis indicare meam sententiam.
7 Sperabam enim quod ætas prolixior loqueretur,et annorum multitudo doceret sapientiam.
8 Sed, ut video, spiritus est in hominibus,et inspiratio Omnipotentis dat intelligentiam.
9 Non sunt longævi sapientes,nec senes intelligunt judicium.
10 Ideo dicam: Audite me:ostendam vobis etiam ego meam sapientiam.
11 Expectavi enim sermones vestros;audivi prudentiam vestram,donec disceptaremini sermonibus;
12 et donec putabam vos aliquid dicere, considerabam:sed, ut video, non est qui possit arguere Job,et respondere ex vobis sermonibus ejus.
13 Ne forte dicatis: Invenimus sapientiam:Deus projecit eum, non homo.
14 Nihil locutus est mihi:et ego non secundum sermones vestros respondebo illi.

15 Extimuerunt, nec responderunt ultra,abstuleruntque a se eloquia.
16 Quoniam igitur expectavi, et non sunt locuti:steterunt, nec ultra responderunt:
17 respondebo et ego partem meam,et ostendam scientiam meam.
18 Plenus sum enim sermonibus,et coarctat me spiritus uteri mei.
19 En venter meus quasi mustum absque spiraculo,quod lagunculas novas disrumpit.
20 Loquar, et respirabo paululum:aperiam labia mea, et respondebo.
21 Non accipiam personam viri,et Deum homini non æquabo.
22 Nescio enim quamdiu subsistam,et si post modicum tollat me factor meus.


# Ἰώβ 32 (Septuagint)

1 ἡσύχασαν δὲ καὶ οἱ τρεῖς φίλοι αὐτοῦ ἔτι ἀντειπεῖν Ιωβ ἦν γὰρ Ιωβ δίκαιος ἐναντίον αὐτῶν
2 ὠργίσθη δὲ Ελιους ὁ τοῦ Βαραχιηλ ὁ Βουζίτης ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας Ραμ τῆς Αυσίτιδος χώρας ὠργίσθη δὲ τῷ Ιωβ σφόδρα διότι ἀπέφηνεν ἑαυτὸν δίκαιον ἐναντίον κυρίου
3 καὶ κατὰ τῶν τριῶν δὲ φίλων ὠργίσθη σφόδρα διότι οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν ἀποκριθῆναι ἀντίθετα Ιωβ καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτὸν εἶναι ἀσεβῆ
4 Ελιους δὲ ὑπέμεινεν δοῦναι ἀπόκρισιν Ιωβ ὅτι πρεσβύτεροι αὐτοῦ εἰσιν ἡμέραις
5 καὶ εἶδεν Ελιους ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἀπόκρισις ἐν στόματι τῶν τριῶν ἀνδρῶν καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργὴ αὐτοῦ

6 ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ελιους ὁ τοῦ Βαραχιηλ ὁ Βουζίτης εἶπεν νεώτερος μέν εἰμι τῷ χρόνῳ ὑμεῖς δέ ἐστε πρεσβύτεροι διὸ ἡσύχασα φοβηθεὶς τοῦ ὑμῖν ἀναγγεῖλαι τὴν ἐμαυτοῦ ἐπιστήμην
7 εἶπα δὲ ὅτι ὁ χρόνος ἐστὶν ὁ λαλῶν ἐν πολλοῖς δὲ ἔτεσιν οἴδασιν σοφίαν
8 ἀλλὰ πνεῦμά ἐστιν ἐν βροτοῖς πνοὴ δὲ παντοκράτορός ἐστιν ἡ διδάσκουσα
9 οὐχ οἱ πολυχρόνιοί εἰσιν σοφοί οὐ{D'} οἱ γέροντες οἴδασιν κρίμα
10 διὸ εἶπα ἀκούσατέ μου καὶ ἀναγγελῶ ὑμῖν ἃ οἶδα
11 ἐνωτίζεσθέ μου τὰ ῥήματα ἐρῶ γὰρ ὑμῶν ἀκουόντων ἄχρι οὗ ἐτάσητε λόγους
12 καὶ μέχρι ὑμῶν συνήσω καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἦν τῷ Ιωβ ἐλέγχων ἀνταποκρινόμενος ῥήματα αὐτοῦ ἐξ ὑμῶν
13 ἵνα μὴ εἴπητε εὕρομεν σοφίαν κυρίῳ προσθέμενοι
14 ἀνθρώπῳ δὲ ἐπετρέψατε λαλῆσαι τοιαῦτα ῥήματα

15 ἐπτοήθησαν οὐκ ἀπεκρίθησαν ἔτι ἐπαλαίωσαν ἐξ αὐτῶν λόγους
16 ὑπέμεινα οὐ γὰρ ἐλάλησαν ὅτι ἔστησαν οὐκ ἀπεκρίθησαν
17 ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ελιους λέγει
18 πάλιν λαλήσω πλήρης γάρ εἰμι ῥημάτων ὀλέκει γάρ με τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς γαστρός
19 ἡ δὲ γαστήρ μου ὥσπερ ἀσκὸς γλεύκους ζέων δεδεμένος ἢ ὥσπερ φυσητὴρ χαλκέως ἐρρηγώς
20 λαλήσω ἵνα ἀναπαύσωμαι ἀνοίξας τὰ χείλη
21 ἄνθρωπον γὰρ οὐ μὴ αἰσχυνθῶ ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδὲ βροτὸν οὐ μὴ ἐντραπῶ
22 οὐ γὰρ ἐπίσταμαι θαυμάσαι πρόσωπον εἰ δὲ μή καὶ ἐμὲ σῆτες ἔδονται
