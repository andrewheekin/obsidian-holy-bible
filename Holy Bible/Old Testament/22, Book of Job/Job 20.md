# Book of Job 20 (RSVCE)

### Zophar Speaks: Wickedness Receives Just Retribution
1 Then Zophar the Naʹamathite answered:
2 “Therefore my thoughts answer me, because of my haste within me.
3 I hear censure which insults me, and out of my understanding a spirit answers me.
4 Do you not know this from of old, since man was placed upon earth,
5 that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment?
6 Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds,
7 he will perish for ever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
8 He will fly away like a dream, and not be found; he will be chased away like a vision of the night.
9 The eye which saw him will see him no more, nor will his place any more behold him.
10 His children will seek the favor of the poor, and his hands will give back his wealth.
11 His bones are full of youthful vigor, but it will lie down with him in the dust.
12 “Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue,
13 though he is loath to let it go, and holds it in his mouth,
14 yet his food is turned in his stomach; it is the gall of asps within him.
15 He swallows down riches and vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly.
16 He will suck the poison of asps; the tongue of a viper will kill him.
17 He will not look upon the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds.
18 He will give back the fruit of his toil, and will not swallow it down; from the profit of his trading he will get no enjoyment.
19 For he has crushed and abandoned the poor, he has seized a house which he did not build.
20 “Because his greed knew no rest, he will not save anything in which he delights.
21 There was nothing left after he had eaten; therefore his prosperity will not endure.
22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he will be in straits; all the force of misery will come upon him.
23 To fill his belly to the full Godbwill send his fierce anger into him, and rain it upon him as his food.c
24 He will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike him through.
25 It is drawn forth and comes out of his body, the glittering point comes out of his gall; terrors come upon him.
26 Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not blown upon will devour him; what is left in his tent will be consumed.
27 The heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him.
28 The possessions of his house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God’sdwrath.
29 This is the wicked man’s portion from God, the heritage decreed for him by God.”


# Liber Job 20 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Respondens autem Sophar Naamathites, dixit:
2 Idcirco cogitationes meæ variæ succedunt sibi,et mens in diversa rapitur.
3 Doctrinam qua me arguis audiam,et spiritus intelligentiæ meæ respondebit mihi.
4 Hoc scio a principio,ex quo positus est homo super terram,
5 quod laus impiorum brevis sit,et gaudium hypocritæ ad instar puncti.

6 Si ascenderit usque ad cælum superbia ejus,et caput ejus nubes tetigerit,
7 quasi sterquilinium in fine perdetur,et qui eum viderant, dicent: Ubi est?
8 Velut somnium avolans non invenietur:transiet sicut visio nocturna.
9 Oculus qui eum viderat non videbit,neque ultra intuebitur eum locus suus.
10 Filii ejus atterentur egestate,et manus illius reddent ei dolorem suum.
11 Ossa ejus implebuntur vitiis adolescentiæ ejus,et cum eo in pulvere dormient.
12 Cum enim dulce fuerit in ore ejus malum,abscondet illud sub lingua sua.
13 Parcet illi, et non derelinquet illud,et celabit in gutture suo.
14 Panis ejus in utero illiusvertetur in fel aspidum intrinsecus.
15 Divitias quas devoravit evomet,et de ventre illius extrahet eas Deus.
16 Caput aspidum suget,et occidet eum lingua viperæ.
17 (Non videat rivulos fluminis,torrentes mellis et butyri.)

18 Luet quæ fecit omnia, nec tamen consumetur:juxta multitudinem adinventionum suarum, sic et sustinebit.
19 Quoniam confringens nudavit pauperes:domum rapuit, et non ædificavit eam.
20 Nec est satiatus venter ejus:et cum habuerit quæ concupierat, possidere non poterit.
21 Non remansit de cibo ejus,et propterea nihil permanebit de bonis ejus.
22 Cum satiatus fuerit, arctabitur:æstuabit, et omnis dolor irruet super eum.
23 Utinam impleatur venter ejus,ut emittat in eum iram furoris sui,et pluat super illum bellum suum.
24 Fugiet arma ferrea,et irruet in arcum æreum.
25 Eductus, et egrediens de vagina sua,et fulgurans in amaritudine sua:vadent et venient super eum horribiles.
26 Omnes tenebræ absconditæ sunt in occultis ejus;devorabit eum ignis qui non succenditur:affligetur relictus in tabernaculo suo.
27 Revelabunt cæli iniquitatem ejus,et terra consurget adversus eum.
28 Apertum erit germen domus illius:detrahetur in die furoris Dei.

29 Hæc est pars hominis impii a Deo,et hæreditas verborum ejus a Domino.


# Ἰώβ 20 (Septuagint)

1 ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Σωφαρ ὁ Μιναῖος λέγει
2 οὐχ οὕτως ὑπελάμβανον ἀντερεῖν σε ταῦτα καὶ οὐχὶ συνίετε μᾶλλον ἢ καὶ ἐγώ
3 παιδείαν ἐντροπῆς μου ἀκούσομαι καὶ πνεῦμα ἐκ τῆς συνέσεως ἀποκρίνεταί μοι
4 μὴ ταῦτα ἔγνως ἀπὸ τοῦ ἔτι ἀ{F'} οὗ ἐτέθη ἄνθρωπος ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
5 εὐφροσύνη γὰρ ἀσεβῶν πτῶμα ἐξαίσιον χαρμονὴ δὲ παρανόμων ἀπώλεια

6 ἐὰν ἀναβῇ εἰς οὐρανὸν αὐτοῦ τὰ δῶρα ἡ δὲ θυσία αὐτοῦ νεφῶν ἅψηται
7 ὅταν γὰρ δοκῇ ἤδη κατεστηρίχθαι τότε εἰς τέλος ἀπολεῖται οἱ δὲ ἰδόντες αὐτὸν ἐροῦσιν ποῦ ἐστιν
8 ὥσπερ ἐνύπνιον ἐκπετασθὲν οὐ μὴ εὑρεθῇ ἔπτη δὲ ὥσπερ φάσμα νυκτερινόν
9 ὀφθαλμὸς παρέβλεψεν καὶ οὐ προσθήσει καὶ οὐκέτι προσνοήσει αὐτὸν ὁ τόπος αὐτοῦ
10 τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ ὀλέσαισαν ἥττονες αἱ δὲ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ πυρσεύσαισαν ὀδύνας
11 ὀστᾶ αὐτοῦ ἐνεπλήσθησαν νεότητος αὐτοῦ καὶ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ χώματος κοιμηθήσεται
12 ἐὰν γλυκανθῇ ἐν στόματι αὐτοῦ κακία κρύψει αὐτὴν ὑπὸ τὴν γλῶσσαν αὐτοῦ
13 οὐ φείσεται αὐτῆς καὶ οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψει αὐτὴν καὶ συνέξει αὐτὴν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λάρυγγος αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ οὐ μὴ δυνηθῇ βοηθῆσαι ἑαυτῷ χολὴ ἀσπίδος ἐν γαστρὶ αὐτοῦ
15 πλοῦτος ἀδίκως συναγόμενος ἐξεμεσθήσεται ἐξ οἰκίας αὐτοῦ ἐξελκύσει αὐτὸν ἄγγελος
16 θυμὸν δὲ δρακόντων θηλάσειεν ἀνέλοι δὲ αὐτὸν γλῶσσα ὄφεως
17 μὴ ἴδοι ἄμελξιν νομάδων μηδὲ νομὰς μέλιτος καὶ βουτύρου

18 εἰς κενὰ καὶ μάταια ἐκοπίασεν πλοῦτον ἐξ οὗ οὐ γεύσεται ὥσπερ στρίφνος ἀμάσητος ἀκατάποτος
19 πολλῶν γὰρ ἀδυνάτων οἴκους ἔθλασεν δίαιταν δὲ ἥρπασεν καὶ οὐκ ἔστησεν
20 οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῦ σωτηρία τοῖς ὑπάρχουσιν ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ αὐτοῦ οὐ σωθήσεται
21 οὐκ ἔστιν ὑπόλειμμα τοῖς βρώμασιν αὐτοῦ διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀνθήσει αὐτοῦ τὰ ἀγαθά
22 ὅταν δὲ δοκῇ ἤδη πεπληρῶσθαι θλιβήσεται πᾶσα δὲ ἀνάγκη ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν ἐπελεύσεται
23 εἴ πως πληρώσαι γαστέρα αὐτοῦ ἐπαποστείλαι ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν θυμὸν ὀργῆς νίψαι ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν ὀδύνας
24 καὶ οὐ μὴ σωθῇ ἐκ χειρὸς σιδήρου τρώσαι αὐτὸν τόξον χάλκειον
25 διεξέλθοι δὲ διὰ σώματος αὐτοῦ βέλος ἀστραπαὶ δὲ ἐν διαίταις αὐτοῦ περιπατήσαισαν ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ φόβοι
26 πᾶν δὲ σκότος αὐτῷ ὑπομείναι κατέδεται αὐτὸν πῦρ ἄκαυστον κακώσαι δὲ αὐτοῦ ἐπήλυτος τὸν οἶκον
27 ἀνακαλύψαι δὲ αὐτοῦ ὁ οὐρανὸς τὰς ἀνομίας γῆ δὲ ἐπανασταίη αὐτῷ
28 ἑλκύσαι τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ἀπώλεια εἰς τέλος ἡμέρα ὀργῆς ἐπέλθοι αὐτῷ

29 αὕτη ἡ μερὶς ἀνθρώπου ἀσεβοῦς παρὰ κυρίου καὶ κτῆμα ὑπαρχόντων αὐτῷ παρὰ τοῦ ἐπισκόπου
