# Song of Solomon 3 (RSVCE)

### Love’s Dream
1 Upon my bed by night I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he gave no answer.g
2 “I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my soul loves.” I sought him, but found him not.
3 The watchmen found me, as they went about in the city. “Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”
4 Scarcely had I passed them, when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
5 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the hinds of the field, that you stir not up nor awaken love until it please.
### The Groom and His Party Approach
6 What is that coming up from the wilderness, like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the fragrant powders of the merchant?
7 Behold, it is the litter of Solomon! About it are sixty mighty men of the mighty men of Israel,
8 all girt with swords and expert in war, each with his sword at his thigh, against alarms by night.
9 King Solomon made himself a palanquin from the wood of Lebanon.
10 He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple; it was lovingly wrought withinh by the daughters of Jerusalem.
11 Go forth, O daughters of Zion, and behold King Solomon, with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the gladness of his heart.


# Canticum Canticorum Salomonis 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In lectulo meo, per noctes,quæsivi quem diligit anima mea:quæsivi illum, et non inveni.
2 Surgam, et circuibo civitatem:per vicos et plateasquæram quem diligit anima mea:quæsivi illum, et non inveni.
3 Invenerunt me vigiles qui custodiunt civitatem:Num quem diligit anima mea vidistis?
4 Paululum cum pertransissem eos,inveni quem diligit anima mea:tenui eum, nec dimittam,donec introducam illum in domum matris meæ,et in cubiculum genetricis meæ.

5 Sponsus. Adjuro vos, filiæ Jerusalem,per capreas cervosque camporum,ne suscitetis, neque evigilare faciatis dilectam,donec ipsa velit.

6 Chorus. Quæ est ista quæ ascendit per desertumsicut virgula fumi ex aromatibus myrrhæ,et thuris, et universi pulveris pigmentarii?

7 En lectulum Salomonis sexaginta fortes ambiuntex fortissimis Israël,
8 omnes tenentes gladios, et ad bella doctissimi:uniuscujusque ensis super femur suumpropter timores nocturnos.
9 Ferculum fecit sibi rex Salomonde lignis Libani;
10 columnas ejus fecit argenteas,reclinatorium aureum, ascensum purpureum;media caritate constravit,propter filias Jerusalem.
11 Egredimini et videte, filiæ Sion,regem Salomonem in diademate quo coronavit illum mater suain die desponsationis illius,et in die lætitiæ cordis ejus.


# ᾎσμα ᾀσμάτων 3 (Septuagint)

1 ἐπὶ κοίτην μου ἐν νυξὶν ἐζήτησα ὃν ἠγάπησεν ἡ ψυχή μου ἐζήτησα αὐτὸν καὶ οὐχ εὗρον αὐτόν ἐκάλεσα αὐτόν καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουσέν μου
2 ἀναστήσομαι δὴ καὶ κυκλώσω ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐν ταῖς ἀγοραῖς καὶ ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις καὶ ζητήσω ὃν ἠγάπησεν ἡ ψυχή μου ἐζήτησα αὐτὸν καὶ οὐχ εὗρον αὐτόν
3 εὕροσάν με οἱ τηροῦντες οἱ κυκλοῦντες ἐν τῇ πόλει μὴ ὃν ἠγάπησεν ἡ ψυχή μου εἴδετε
4 ὡς μικρὸν ὅτε παρῆλθον ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν ἕως οὗ εὗρον ὃν ἠγάπησεν ἡ ψυχή μου ἐκράτησα αὐτὸν καὶ οὐκ ἀφήσω αὐτόν ἕως οὗ εἰσήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς οἶκον μητρός μου καὶ εἰς ταμίειον τῆς συλλαβούσης με

5 ὥρκισα ὑμᾶς θυγατέρες Ιερουσαλημ ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσιν καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἰσχύσεσιν τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἐὰν ἐγείρητε καὶ ἐξεγείρητε τὴν ἀγάπην ἕως ἂν θελήσῃ

6 τίς αὕτη ἡ ἀναβαίνουσα ἀπὸ τῆς ἐρήμου ὡς στελέχη καπνοῦ τεθυμιαμένη σμύρναν καὶ λίβανον ἀπὸ πάντων κονιορτῶν μυρεψοῦ

7 ἰδοὺ ἡ κλίνη τοῦ Σαλωμων ἑξήκοντα δυνατοὶ κύκλῳ αὐτῆς ἀπὸ δυνατῶν Ισραηλ
8 πάντες κατέχοντες ῥομφαίαν δεδιδαγμένοι πόλεμον ἀνὴρ ῥομφαία αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ μηρὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ θάμβους ἐν νυξίν
9 φορεῖον ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμων ἀπὸ ξύλων τοῦ Λιβάνου
10 στύλους αὐτοῦ ἐποίησεν ἀργύριον καὶ ἀνάκλιτον αὐτοῦ χρύσεον ἐπίβασις αὐτοῦ πορφυρᾶ ἐντὸς αὐτοῦ λιθόστρωτον ἀγάπην ἀπὸ θυγατέρων Ιερουσαλημ
11 ἐξέλθατε καὶ ἴδετε ἐν τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμων ἐν τῷ στεφάνῳ ᾧ ἐστεφάνωσεν αὐτὸν ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ νυμφεύσεως αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ εὐφροσύνης καρδίας αὐτοῦ
