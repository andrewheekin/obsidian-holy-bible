# Book of Joel 3 (RSVCE)

1 “For behold, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
2 I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshʹaphat, and I will enter into judgment with them there, on account of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations, and have divided up my land,
3 and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a harlot, and have sold a girl for wine, and have drunk it.
4 “What are you to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, I will requite your deed upon your own head swiftly and speedily.
5 For you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures into your temples.
6 You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, removing them far from their own border.
7 But now I will stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will requite your deed upon your own head.
8 I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeʹans, to a nation far off; for theLordhas spoken.”
### Judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat
9 Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare war, stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.
10 Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, “I am a warrior.”
11 Hasten and come, all you nations round about, gather yourselves there. Bring down thy warriors, OLord.
12 Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshʹaphat; for there I will sit to judge all the nations round about.
13 Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Go in, tread, for the wine press is full. The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.
14 Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of theLordis near in the valley of decision.
15 The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
16 And theLordroars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shake. But theLordis a refuge to his people, a stronghold to the people of Israel.
### The Glorious Future of Judah
17 “So you shall know that I am theLordyour God, who dwell in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy and strangers shall never again pass through it.
18 “And in that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the stream beds of Judah shall flow with water; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of theLord and water the valley of Shittim.
19 “Egypt shall become a desolation and Edom a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the people of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
20 But Judah shall be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem to all generations.
21 I will avenge their blood, and I will not clear the guilty, for theLorddwells in Zion.”


# Prophetia Joel 3 (Latin Vulgate)

28 Et erit post hæc:effundam spiritum meum super omnem carnem,et prophetabunt filii vestri et filiæ vestræ:senes vestri somnia somniabunt,et juvenes vestri visiones videbunt.
29 Sed et super servos meos et ancillasin diebus illis effundam spiritum meum.
30 Et dabo prodigia in cælo et in terra,sanguinem, et ignem, et vaporem fumi.
31 Sol convertetur in tenebras,et luna in sanguinem,antequam veniat dies Domini magnus et horribilis.
32 Et erit: omnis qui invocaverit nomen Domini, salvus erit:quia in monte Sion et in Jerusalemerit salvatio, sicut dixit Dominus,et in residuis quos Dominus vocaverit.


# Ἰωήλ 3 (Septuagint)

28 καὶ ἔσται μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματός μου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα καὶ προφητεύσουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες ὑμῶν καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ὑμῶν ἐνύπνια ἐνυπνιασθήσονται καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι ὑμῶν ὁράσεις ὄψονται
29 καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς δούλας ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματός μου
30 καὶ δώσω τέρατα ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αἷμα καὶ πῦρ καὶ ἀτμίδα καπνοῦ
31 ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα πρὶν ἐλθεῖν ἡμέραν κυρίου τὴν μεγάλην καὶ ἐπιφανῆ
32 καὶ ἔσται πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐπικαλέσηται τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου σωθήσεται ὅτι ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σιων καὶ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἔσται ἀνασῳζόμενος καθότι εἶπεν κύριος καὶ εὐαγγελιζόμενοι οὓς κύριος προσκέκληται
