# Book of Ezra 5 (RSVCE)

### Restoration of the Temple Resumed
1 Now the prophets, Hagʹgai and Zechariʹah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.
2 Then Zerubʹbabel the son of She-alʹti-el and Jeshua the son of Joʹzadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.
3 At the same time Tatʹtenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Sheʹthar-bozʹenai and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus, “Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?”
4 They also asked them this, “What are the names of the men who are building this building?”
5 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them till a report should reach Dariʹus and then answer be returned by letter concerning it.
6 The copy of the letter which Tatʹtenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Sheʹthar-bozʹenai and his associates the governors who were in the province Beyond the River sent to Dariʹus the king;
7 they sent him a report, in which was written as follows: “To Dariʹus the king, all peace.
8 Be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is being built with huge stones, and timber is laid in the walls; this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands.
9 Then we asked those elders and spoke to them thus, ‘Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?’
10 We also asked them their names, for your information, that we might write down the names of the men at their head.
11 And this was their reply to us: ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.
12 But because our fathers had angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezʹzar king of Babylon, the Chaldeʹan, who destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia.
13 However in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be rebuilt.
14 And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezʹzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Shesh-bazʹzar, whom he had made governor;
15 and he said to him, “Take these vessels, go and put them in the temple which is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site.”
16 Then this Shesh-bazʹzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and from that time until now it has been in building, and it is not yet finished.’
17 Therefore, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see whether a decree was issued by Cyrus the king for the rebuilding of this house of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send us his pleasure in this matter.”


# Liber Esdrae Primus 5 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Prophetaverunt autem Aggæus propheta, et Zacharias filius Addo, prophetantes ad Judæos qui erant in Judæa et Jerusalem, in nomine Dei Israël.
2 Tunc surrexerunt Zorobabel filius Salathiel, et Josue filius Josedec, et cœperunt ædificare templum Dei in Jerusalem, et cum eis prophetæ Dei adjuvantes eos.
3 In ipso autem tempore venit ad eos Thathanai, qui erat dux trans flumen, et Stharbuzanai, et consiliarii eorum: sicque dixerunt eis: Quis dedit vobis consilium ut domum hanc ædificaretis, et muros ejus instauraretis?
4 Ad quod respondimus eis, quæ essent nomina hominum auctorum ædificationis illius.
5 Oculus autem Dei eorum factus est super senes Judæorum, et non potuerunt inhibere eos. Placuitque ut res ad Darium referretur, et tunc satisfacerent adversus accusationem illam.

6 Exemplar epistolæ, quam misit Thathanai dux regionis trans flumen, et Stharbuzanai, et consiliatores ejus Arphasachæi, qui erant trans flumen, ad Darium regem.
7 Sermo, quem miserant ei, sic scriptus erat: Dario regi pax omnis.
8 Notum sit regi, isse nos ad Judæam provinciam, ad domum Dei magni, quæ ædificatur lapide impolito, et ligna ponuntur in parietibus: opusque illud diligenter exstruitur, et crescit in manibus eorum.
9 Interrogavimus ergo senes illos, et ita diximus eis: Quis dedit vobis potestatem ut domum hanc ædificaretis, et muros hos instauraretis?
10 Sed et nomina eorum quæsivimus ab eis, ut nuntiaremus tibi: scripsimusque nomina eorum virorum, qui sunt principes in eis.
11 Hujuscemodi autem sermonem responderunt nobis dicentes: Nos sumus servi Dei cæli et terræ, et ædificamus templum, quod erat exstructum ante hos annos multos, quodque rex Israël magnus ædificaverat, et exstruxerat.
12 Postquam autem ad iracundiam provocaverunt patres nostri Deum cæli, tradidit eos in manus Nabuchodonosor regis Babylonis Chaldæi, domum quoque hanc destruxit, et populum ejus transtulit in Babylonem.
13 Anno autem primo Cyri regis Babylonis, Cyrus rex proposuit edictum ut domus Dei hæc ædificaretur.
14 Nam et vasa templi Dei aurea et argentea, quæ Nabuchodonosor tulerat de templo, quod erat in Jerusalem, et asportaverat ea in templum Babylonis, protulit Cyrus rex de templo Babylonis, et data sunt Sassabasar vocabulo, quem et principem constituit,
15 dixitque ei: Hæc vasa tolle, et vade, et pone ea in templo, quod est in Jerusalem, et domus Dei ædificetur in loco suo.
16 Tunc itaque Sassabasar ille venit et posuit fundamenta templi Dei in Jerusalem, et ex eo tempore usque nunc ædificatur, et necdum completum est.

17 Nunc ergo si videtur regi bonum, recenseat in bibliotheca regis, quæ est in Babylone, utrumnam a Cyro rege jussum fuerit ut ædificaretur domus Dei in Jerusalem, et voluntatem regis super hac re mittat ad nos.


# Ἔσδρας Βʹ 5 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐπροφήτευσεν Αγγαιος ὁ προφήτης καὶ Ζαχαριας ὁ τοῦ Αδδω προφητείαν ἐπὶ τοὺς Ιουδαίους τοὺς ἐν Ιουδα καὶ Ιερουσαλημ ἐν ὀνόματι θεοῦ Ισραηλ ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
2 τότε ἀνέστησαν Ζοροβαβελ ὁ τοῦ Σαλαθιηλ καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ υἱὸς Ιωσεδεκ καὶ ἤρξαντο οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ τὸν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ με{T'} αὐτῶν οἱ προφῆται τοῦ θεοῦ βοηθοῦντες αὐτοῖς
3 ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ καιρῷ ἦλθεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς Θανθαναι ἔπαρχος πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ Σαθαρβουζανα καὶ οἱ σύνδουλοι αὐτῶν καὶ τοῖα εἶπαν αὐτοῖς τίς ἔθηκεν ὑμῖν γνώμην τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον καὶ τὴν χορηγίαν ταύτην καταρτίσασθαι
4 τότε ταῦτα εἴποσαν αὐτοῖς τίνα ἐστὶν τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν οἰκοδομούντων τὴν πόλιν ταύτην
5 καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν Ιουδα καὶ οὐ κατήργησαν αὐτούς ἕως γνώμη τῷ Δαρείῳ ἀπηνέχθη καὶ τότε ἀπεστάλη τῷ φορολόγῳ ὑπὲρ τούτου

6 διασάφησις ἐπιστολῆς ἧς ἀπέστειλεν Θανθαναι ὁ ἔπαρχος τοῦ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ Σαθαρβουζανα καὶ οἱ σύνδουλοι αὐτῶν Αφαρσαχαῖοι οἱ ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ Δαρείῳ τῷ βασιλεῖ
7 ῥῆσιν ἀπέστειλαν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ τάδε γέγραπται ἐν αὐτῷ Δαρείῳ τῷ βασιλεῖ εἰρήνη πᾶσα
8 γνωστὸν ἔστω τῷ βασιλεῖ ὅτι ἐπορεύθημεν εἰς τὴν Ιουδαίαν χώραν εἰς οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ μεγάλου καὶ αὐτὸς οἰκοδομεῖται λίθοις ἐκλεκτοῖς καὶ ξύλα ἐντίθεται ἐν τοῖς τοίχοις καὶ τὸ ἔργον ἐκεῖνο ἐπιδέξιον γίνεται καὶ εὐοδοῦται ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν
9 τότε ἠρωτήσαμεν τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ἐκείνους καὶ οὕτως εἴπαμεν αὐτοῖς τίς ἔθηκεν ὑμῖν γνώμην τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον οἰκοδομῆσαι καὶ τὴν χορηγίαν ταύτην καταρτίσασθαι
10 καὶ τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν ἠρωτήσαμεν αὐτοὺς γνωρίσαι σοι ὥστε γράψαι σοι τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτῶν
11 καὶ τοιοῦτο ῥῆμα ἀπεκρίθησαν ἡμῖν λέγοντες ἡμεῖς ἐσμεν δοῦλοι τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ οἰκοδομοῦμεν τὸν οἶκον ὃς ἦν ᾠκοδομημένος πρὸ τούτου ἔτη πολλά καὶ βασιλεὺς τοῦ Ισραηλ μέγας ᾠκοδόμησεν αὐτὸν καὶ κατηρτίσατο αὐτὸν
12 αὐτοῖς ἀ{F'} ὅτε δὲ παρώργισαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν τὸν θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος τοῦ Χαλδαίου καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον κατέλυσεν καὶ τὸν λαὸν ἀπῴκισεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα
13 ἀλ{L'} ἐν ἔτει πρώτῳ Κύρου τοῦ βασιλέως Κῦρος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἔθετο γνώμην τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦτον οἰκοδομηθῆναι
14 καὶ τὰ σκεύη τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ θεοῦ τὰ χρυσᾶ καὶ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ ἃ Ναβουχοδονοσορ ἐξήνεγκεν ἀπὸ οἴκου τοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἀπήνεγκεν αὐτὰ εἰς ναὸν τοῦ βασιλέως ἐξήνεγκεν αὐτὰ Κῦρος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀπὸ ναοῦ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἔδωκεν τῷ Σασαβασαρ τῷ θησαυροφύλακι τῷ ἐπὶ τοῦ θησαυροῦ
15 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ σκεύη λαβὲ καὶ πορεύου θὲς αὐτὰ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τῷ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ εἰς τὸν ἑαυτῶν τόπον
16 τότε Σασαβασαρ ἐκεῖνος ἦλθεν καὶ ἔδωκεν θεμελίους τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἀπὸ τότε ἕως τοῦ νῦν ᾠκοδομήθη καὶ οὐκ ἐτελέσθη

17 καὶ νῦν εἰ ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα ἀγαθόν ἐπισκεπήτω ἐν οἴκῳ τῆς γάζης τοῦ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος ὅπως γνῷς ὅτι ἀπὸ βασιλέως Κύρου ἐτέθη γνώμη οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ ἐκεῖνον τὸν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ γνοὺς ὁ βασιλεὺς περὶ τούτου πεμψάτω πρὸς ἡμᾶς
