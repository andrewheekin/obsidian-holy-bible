### End of the Babylonian Captivity
1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of theLordby the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, theLordstirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:
2 “Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: TheLord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
3 Whoever is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of theLord, the God of Israel—he is the God who is in Jerusalem;
4 and let each survivor, in whatever place he sojourns, be assisted by the men of his place with silver and gold, with goods and with beasts, besides freewill offerings for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.”
5 Then rose up the heads of the fathers’ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, every one whose spirit God had stirred to go up to rebuild the house of theLordwhich is in Jerusalem;
6 and all who were about them aided them with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with beasts, and with costly wares, besides all that was freely offered.
7 Cyrus the king also brought out the vessels of the house of theLordwhich Nebuchadnezʹzar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.
8 Cyrus king of Persia brought these out in charge of Mithʹredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Shesh-bazʹzar the prince of Judah.
9 And this was the number of them: a thousand basins of gold, a thousand basins of silver, twenty-nine censers,
10 thirty bowls of gold, two thousand four hundred and ten bowls of silver, and a thousand other vessels;
11 all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand four hundred and sixty-nine. All these did Shesh-bazʹzar bring up, when the exiles were brought up from Babylonia to Jerusalem.


# Liber Esdrae Primus 1 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In anno primo Cyri regis Persarum, ut compleretur verbum Domini ex ore Jeremiæ, suscitavit Dominus spiritum Cyri regis Persarum: et traduxit vocem in omni regno suo, etiam per scripturam, dicens:
2 Hæc dicit Cyrus rex Persarum: Omnia regna terræ dedit mihi Dominus Deus cæli, et ipse præcepit mihi ut ædificarem ei domum in Jerusalem, quæ est in Judæa.
3 Quis est in vobis de universo populo ejus? Sit Deus illius cum ipso. Ascendat in Jerusalem, quæ est in Judæa, et ædificet domum Domini Dei Israël: ipse est Deus qui est in Jerusalem.
4 Et omnes reliqui in cunctis locis ubicumque habitant, adjuvent eum viri de loco suo argento et auro, et substantia, et pecoribus, excepto quod voluntarie offerunt templo Dei, quod est in Jerusalem.

5 Et surrexerunt principes patrum de Juda et Benjamin, et sacerdotes, et Levitæ, et omnis cujus Deus suscitavit spiritum, ut ascenderent ad ædificandum templum Domini, quod erat in Jerusalem.
6 Universique qui erant in circuitu, adjuverunt manus eorum in vasis argenteis et aureis, in substantia et jumentis, in supellectili, exceptis his quæ sponte obtulerant.
7 Rex quoque Cyrus protulit vasa templi Domini, quæ tulerat Nabuchodonosor de Jerusalem, et posuerat ea in templo dei sui.
8 Protulit autem ea Cyrus rex Persarum per manum Mithridatis filii Gazabar, et annumeravit ea Sassabasar principi Juda.
9 Et hic est numerus eorum: phialæ aureæ triginta, phialæ argenteæ mille, cultri viginti novem, scyphi aurei triginta,
10 scyphi argentei secundi quadringenti decem, vasa alia mille.
11 Omnia vasa aurea et argentea quinque millia quadringenta: universa tulit Sassabasar cum his qui ascendebant de transmigratione Babylonis in Jerusalem.

1 καὶ ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ ἔτει Κύρου τοῦ βασιλέως Περσῶν τοῦ τελεσθῆναι λόγον κυρίου ἀπὸ στόματος Ιερεμιου ἐξήγειρεν κύριος τὸ πνεῦμα Κύρου βασιλέως Περσῶν καὶ παρήγγειλεν φωνὴν ἐν πάσῃ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ καί γε ἐν γραπτῷ λέγων
2 οὕτως εἶπεν Κῦρος βασιλεὺς Περσῶν πάσας τὰς βασιλείας τῆς γῆς ἔδωκέν μοι κύριος ὁ θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπεσκέψατο ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι αὐτῷ οἶκον ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τῇ ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ
3 τίς ἐν ὑμῖν ἀπὸ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔσται ὁ θεὸς αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀναβήσεται εἰς Ιερουσαλημ τὴν ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ καὶ οἰκοδομησάτω τὸν οἶκον θεοῦ Ισραηλ αὐτὸς ὁ θεὸς ὁ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
4 καὶ πᾶς ὁ καταλειπόμενος ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τόπων οὗ αὐτὸς παροικεῖ ἐκεῖ καὶ λήμψονται αὐτὸν ἄνδρες τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσίῳ καὶ ἀποσκευῇ καὶ κτήνεσιν μετὰ τοῦ ἑκουσίου εἰς οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ

5 καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἄρχοντες τῶν πατριῶν τῷ Ιουδα καὶ Βενιαμιν καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται πάντων ὧν ἐξήγειρεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτῶν τοῦ ἀναβῆναι οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον κυρίου τὸν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
6 καὶ πάντες οἱ κυκλόθεν ἐνίσχυσαν ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν ἐν σκεύεσιν ἀργυρίου ἐν χρυσῷ ἐν ἀποσκευῇ καὶ ἐν κτήνεσιν καὶ ἐν ξενίοις πάρεξ τῶν ἐν ἑκουσίοις
7 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Κῦρος ἐξήνεγκεν τὰ σκεύη οἴκου κυρίου ἃ ἔλαβεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ ἀπὸ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ ἐν οἴκῳ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ
8 καὶ ἐξήνεγκεν αὐτὰ Κῦρος βασιλεὺς Περσῶν ἐπὶ χεῖρα Μιθραδάτου γασβαρηνου καὶ ἠρίθμησεν αὐτὰ τῷ Σασαβασαρ ἄρχοντι τοῦ Ιουδα
9 καὶ οὗτος ὁ ἀριθμὸς αὐτῶν ψυκτῆρες χρυσοῖ τριάκοντα καὶ ψυκτῆρες ἀργυροῖ χίλιοι παρηλλαγμένα ἐννέα καὶ εἴκοσι
10 κεφφουρη χρυσοῖ τριάκοντα καὶ ἀργυροῖ διακόσιοι καὶ σκεύη ἕτερα χίλια
11 πάντα τὰ σκεύη τῷ χρυσῷ καὶ τῷ ἀργύρῳ πεντακισχίλια καὶ τετρακόσια τὰ πάντα ἀναβαίνοντα μετὰ Σασαβασαρ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀποικίας ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Ιερουσαλημ
