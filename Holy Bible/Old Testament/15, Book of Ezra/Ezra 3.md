# Book of Ezra 3 (RSVCE)

### Worship Restored at Jerusalem
1 When the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the towns, the people gathered as one man to Jerusalem.
2 Then arose Jeshua the son of Joʹzadak, with his fellow priests, and Zerubʹbabel the son of She-alʹti-el with his kinsmen, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings upon it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
3 They set the altar in its place, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the lands, and they offered burnt offerings upon it to theLord, burnt offerings morning and evening.
4 And they kept the feast of booths, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance, as each day required,
5 and after that the continual burnt offerings, the offerings at the new moon and at all the appointed feasts of theLord, and the offerings of every one who made a freewill offering to theLord.
6 From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to theLord. But the foundation of the temple of theLordwas not yet laid.
7 So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sidoʹnians and the Tyrians to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant which they had from Cyrus king of Persia.
### Foundation Laid for the Temple
8 Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubʹbabel the son of She-alʹti-el and Jeshua the son of Joʹzadak made a beginning, together with the rest of their brethren, the priests and the Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem from the captivity. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of theLord.
9 And Jeshua with his sons and his kinsmen, and Kadʹmi-el and his sons, the sons of Judah, together took the oversight of the workmen in the house of God, along with the sons of Henʹadad and the Levites, their sons and kinsmen.
10 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of theLord, the priests in their vestments came forward with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise theLord, according to the directions of David king of Israel;
11 and they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to theLord, “For he is good, for his steadfast love endures for ever toward Israel.” And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised theLord, because the foundation of the house of theLordwas laid.
12 But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ houses, old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house being laid, though many shouted aloud for joy;
13 so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people’s weeping, for the people shouted with a great shout, and the sound was heard afar.


# Liber Esdrae Primus 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Jamque venerat mensis septimus, et erant filii Israël in civitatibus suis: congregatus est ergo populus quasi vir unus in Jerusalem.
2 Et surrexit Josue filius Josedec, et fratres ejus sacerdotes, et Zorobabel filius Salathiel, et fratres ejus, et ædificaverunt altare Dei Israël ut offerrent in eo holocautomata, sicut scriptum est in lege Moysi viri Dei.
3 Collocaverunt autem altare Dei super bases suas, deterrentibus eos per circuitum populis terrarum: et obtulerunt super illud holocaustum Domino mane et vespere.
4 Feceruntque solemnitatem tabernaculorum, sicut scriptum est, et holocaustum diebus singulis per ordinem secundum præceptum opus diei in die suo.
5 Et post hæc holocaustum juge, tam in calendis quam in universis solemnitatibus Domini quæ erant consecratæ, et in omnibus in quibus ultro offerebatur munus Domino.
6 A primo die mensis septimi cœperunt offerre holocaustum Domino: porro templum Dei nondum fundatum erat.

7 Dederunt autem pecunias latomis et cæmentariis: cibum quoque, et potum, et oleum Sidoniis Tyriisque, ut deferrent ligna cedrina de Libano ad mare Joppe, juxta quod præceperat Cyrus rex Persarum eis.
8 Anno autem secundo adventus eorum ad templum Dei in Jerusalem, mense secundo, cœperunt Zorobabel filius Salathiel, et Josue filius Josedec, et reliqui de fratribus eorum sacerdotes, et Levitæ, et omnes qui venerant de captivitate in Jerusalem, et constituerunt Levitas a viginti annis et supra, ut urgerent opus Domini.
9 Stetitque Josue et filii ejus et fratres ejus, Cedmihel et filii ejus, et filii Juda, quasi vir unus, ut instarent super eos qui faciebant opus in templo Dei: filii Henadad, et filii eorum, et fratres eorum Levitæ.
10 Fundato igitur a cæmentariis templo Domini, steterunt sacerdotes in ornatu suo cum tubis, et Levitæ filii Asaph in cymbalis, ut laudarent Deum per manus David regis Israël.
11 Et concinebant in hymnis, et confessione Domino: Quoniam bonus, quoniam in æternum misericordia ejus super Israël. Omnis quoque populus vociferabatur clamore magno in laudando Dominum, eo quod fundatum esset templum Domini.

12 Plurimi etiam de sacerdotibus et Levitis, et principes patrum, et seniores, qui viderant templum prius cum fundatum esset, et hoc templum, in oculis eorum, flebant voce magna: et multi vociferantes in lætitia, elevabant vocem.
13 Nec poterat quisquam agnoscere vocem clamoris lætantium, et vocem fletus populi: commistim enim populus vociferabatur clamore magno, et vox audiebatur procul.

1 καὶ ἔφθασεν ὁ μὴν ὁ ἕβδομος καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἐν πόλεσιν αὐτῶν καὶ συνήχθη ὁ λαὸς ὡς ἀνὴρ εἷς εἰς Ιερουσαλημ
2 καὶ ἀνέστη Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ιωσεδεκ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἱερεῖς καὶ Ζοροβαβελ ὁ τοῦ Σαλαθιηλ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν τὸ θυσιαστήριον θεοῦ Ισραηλ τοῦ ἀνενέγκαι ἐ{P'} αὐτὸ ὁλοκαυτώσεις κατὰ τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν νόμῳ Μωυσῆ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ
3 καὶ ἡτοίμασαν τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτοιμασίαν αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐν καταπλήξει ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν λαῶν τῶν γαιῶν καὶ ἀνέβη ἐ{P'} αὐτὸ ὁλοκαύτωσις τῷ κυρίῳ τὸ πρωὶ καὶ εἰς ἑσπέραν
4 καὶ ἐποίησαν τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν σκηνῶν κατὰ τὸ γεγραμμένον καὶ ὁλοκαυτώσεις ἡμέραν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐν ἀριθμῷ ὡς ἡ κρίσις λόγον ἡμέρας ἐν ἡμέρᾳ αὐτοῦ
5 καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ὁλοκαυτώσεις ἐνδελεχισμοῦ καὶ εἰς τὰς νουμηνίας καὶ εἰς πάσας ἑορτὰς τὰς ἡγιασμένας καὶ παντὶ ἑκουσιαζομένῳ ἑκούσιον τῷ κυρίῳ
6 ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ ἑβδόμου ἤρξαντο ἀναφέρειν ὁλοκαυτώσεις τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ ὁ οἶκος κυρίου οὐκ ἐθεμελιώθη

7 καὶ ἔδωκαν ἀργύριον τοῖς λατόμοις καὶ τοῖς τέκτοσιν καὶ βρώματα καὶ ποτὰ καὶ ἔλαιον τοῖς Σηδανιν καὶ τοῖς Σωριν ἐνέγκαι ξύλα κέδρινα ἀπὸ τοῦ Λιβάνου πρὸς θάλασσαν Ιόππης κα{T'} ἐπιχώρησιν Κύρου βασιλέως Περσῶν ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
8 καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ δευτέρῳ τοῦ ἐλθεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ εἰς Ιερουσαλημ ἐν μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἤρξατο Ζοροβαβελ ὁ τοῦ Σαλαθιηλ καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ιωσεδεκ καὶ οἱ κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται καὶ πάντες οἱ ἐρχόμενοι ἀπὸ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἔστησαν τοὺς Λευίτας ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω ἐπὶ τοὺς ποιοῦντας τὰ ἔργα ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου
9 καὶ ἔστη Ἰησοῦς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ Καδμιηλ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ υἱοὶ Ιουδα ἐπὶ τοὺς ποιοῦντας τὰ ἔργα ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ θεοῦ υἱοὶ Ηναδαδ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν καὶ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν οἱ Λευῖται
10 καὶ ἐθεμελίωσαν τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον κυρίου καὶ ἔστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐστολισμένοι ἐν σάλπιγξιν καὶ οἱ Λευῖται υἱοὶ Ασαφ ἐν κυμβάλοις τοῦ αἰνεῖν τὸν κύριον ἐπὶ χεῖρας Δαυιδ βασιλέως Ισραηλ
11 καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν ἐν αἴνῳ καὶ ἀνθομολογήσει τῷ κυρίῳ ὅτι ἀγαθόν ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐσήμαινον φωνὴν μεγάλην αἰνεῖν τῷ κυρίῳ ἐπὶ θεμελιώσει οἴκου κυρίου

12 καὶ πολλοὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἱερέων καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν καὶ ἄρχοντες τῶν πατριῶν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι οἳ εἴδοσαν τὸν οἶκον τὸν πρῶτον ἐν θεμελιώσει αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦτον τὸν οἶκον ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν ἔκλαιον φωνῇ μεγάλῃ καὶ ὄχλος ἐν σημασίᾳ με{T'} εὐφροσύνης τοῦ ὑψῶσαι ᾠδήν
13 καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ λαὸς ἐπιγινώσκων φωνὴν σημασίας τῆς εὐφροσύνης ἀπὸ τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ κλαυθμοῦ τοῦ λαοῦ ὅτι ὁ λαὸς ἐκραύγασεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ καὶ ἡ φωνὴ ἠκούετο ἕως ἀπὸ μακρόθεν
