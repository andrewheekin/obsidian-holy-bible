# First Book of Maccabees 10 (RSVCE)

### Revolt of Alexander Epiphanes
1 In the one hundred and sixtieth year Alexander Epiphʹanes, the son of Antiʹochus, landed and occupied Ptolemaʹis. They welcomed him, and there he began to reign.
2 When Demeʹtrius the king heard of it, he assembled a very large army and marched out to meet him in battle.
3 And Demeʹtrius sent Jonathan a letter in peaceable words to honor him;
4 for he said, “Let us act first to make peace with him before he makes peace with Alexander against us,
5 for he will remember all the wrongs which we did to him and to his brothers and his nation.”
6 So Demeʹtrius gave him authority to recruit troops, to equip them with arms, and to become his ally; and he commanded that the hostages in the citadel should be released to him.
7 Then Jonathan came to Jerusalem and read the letter in the hearing of all the people and of the men in the citadel.
8 They were greatly alarmed when they heard that the king had given him authority to recruit troops.
9 But the men in the citadel released the hostages to Jonathan, and he returned them to their parents.
10 And Jonathan dwelt in Jerusalem and began to rebuild and restore the city.
11 He directed those who were doing the work to build the walls and encircle Mount Zion with squared stones, for better fortification; and they did so.
12 Then the foreigners who were in the strongholds that Bacʹchides had built fled;
13 each left his place and departed to his own land.
14 Only in Beth-zur did some remain who had forsaken the law and the commandments, for it served as a place of refuge.
15 Now Alexander the king heard of all the promises which Demeʹtrius had sent to Jonathan, and men told him of the battles that Jonathan and his brothers had fought, of the brave deeds that they had done, and of the troubles that they had endured.
16 So he said, “Shall we find another such man? Come now, we will make him our friend and ally.”
17 And he wrote a letter and sent it to him, in the following words:
### Jonathan Becomes High Priest
18 “King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greeting.
19 We have heard about you, that you are a mighty warrior and worthy to be our friend.
20 And so we have appointed you today to be the high priest of your nation; you are to be called the king’s friend” (and he sent him a purple robe and a golden crown) “and you are to take our side and keep friendship with us.”
21 So Jonathan put on the holy garments in the seventh month of the one hundred and sixtieth year, at the feast of tabernacles, and he recruited troops and equipped them with arms in abundance.
22 When Demeʹtrius heard of these things he was grieved and said,
23 “What is this that we have done? Alexander has gotten ahead of us in forming a friendship with the Jews to strengthen himself.
24 I also will write them words of encouragement and promise them honor and gifts, that I may have their help.”
### A Letter from Demetrius to Jonathan
25 So he sent a message to them in the following words: “King Demeʹtrius to the nation of the Jews, greeting.
26 Since you have kept your agreement with us and have continued your friendship with us, and have not sided with our enemies, we have heard of it and rejoiced.
27 And now continue still to keep faith with us, and we will repay you with good for what you do for us.
28 We will grant you many immunities and give you gifts.
29 “And now I free you and exempt all the Jews from payment of tribute and salt tax and crown levies,
30 and instead of collecting the third of the grain and the half of the fruit of the trees that I should receive, I release them from this day and henceforth. I will not collect them from the land of Judah or from the three districts added to it from Samarʹia and Galilee, from this day and for all time.
31 And let Jerusalem and her environs, her tithes and her revenues, be holy and free from tax.
32 I release also my control of the citadel in Jerusalem and give it to the high priest, that he may station in it men of his own choice to guard it.
33 And every one of the Jews taken as a captive from the land of Judah into any part of my kingdom, I set free without payment; and let all officials cancel also the taxes on their cattle.
34 “And all the feasts and sabbaths and new moons and appointed days, and the three days before a feast and the three after a feast—let them all be days of immunity and release for all the Jews who are in my kingdom.
35 No one shall have authority to exact anything from them or annoy any of them about any matter.
36 “Let Jews be enrolled in the king’s forces to the number of thirty thousand men, and let the maintenance be given them that is due to all the forces of the king.
37 Let some of them be stationed in the great strongholds of the king, and let some of them be put in positions of trust in the kingdom. Let their officers and leaders be of their own number, and let them live by their own laws, just as the king has commanded in the land of Judah.
38 “As for the three districts that have been added to Judea from the country of Samarʹia, let them be so annexed to Judea that they are considered to be under one ruler and obey no other authority but the high priest.
39 Ptolemaʹis and the land adjoining it I have given as a gift to the sanctuary in Jerusalem, to meet the necessary expenses of the sanctuary.
40 I also grant fifteen thousand shekels of silver yearly out of the king’s revenues from appropriate places.
41 And all the additional funds which the government officials have not paid as they did in the first years, they shall give from now on for the service of the temple.
42 Moreover, the five thousand shekels of silver which my officials have received every year from the income of the services of the temple, this too is canceled, because it belongs to the priests who minister there.
43 And whoever takes refuge at the temple in Jerusalem, or in any of its precincts, because he owes money to the king or has any debt, let him be released and receive back all his property in my kingdom.
44 “Let the cost of rebuilding and restoring the structures of the sanctuary be paid from the revenues of the king.
45 And let the cost of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and fortifying it round about, and the cost of rebuilding the walls in Judea, also be paid from the revenues of the king.”
### Death of Demetrius
46 When Jonathan and the people heard these words, they did not believe or accept them, because they remembered the great wrongs which Demeʹtrius had done in Israel and how he had greatly oppressed them.
47 They favored Alexander, because he had been the first to speak peaceable words to them, and they remained his allies all his days.
48 Now Alexander the king assembled large forces and encamped opposite Demeʹtrius.
49 The two kings met in battle, and the army of Demeʹtrius fled, and Alexander pursued him and defeated them.
50 He pressed the battle strongly until the sun set, and Demeʹtrius fell on that day.
### Treaty of Ptolemy and Alexander
51 Then Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolʹemy king of Egypt with the following message:
52 “Since I have returned to my kingdom and have taken my seat on the throne of my fathers, and established my rule—for I crushed Demeʹtrius and gained control of our country;
53 I met him in battle, and he and his army were crushed by us, and we have taken our seat on the throne of his kingdom—
54 now therefore let us establish friendship with one another; give me now your daughter as my wife, and I will become your son-in-law, and will make gifts to you and to her in keeping with your position.”
55 Ptolʹemy the king replied and said, “Happy was the day on which you returned to the land of your fathers and took your seat on the throne of their kingdom.
56 And now I will do for you as you wrote, but meet me at Ptolemaʹis, so that we may see one another, and I will become your father-in-law, as you have said.”
57 So Ptolʹemy set out from Egypt, he and Cleopatra his daughter, and came to Ptolemaʹis in the one hundred and sixty-second year.
58 Alexander the king met him, and Ptolʹemy gave him Cleopatra his daughter in marriage, and celebrated her wedding at Ptolemaʹis with great pomp, as kings do.
59 Then Alexander the king wrote to Jonathan to come to meet him.
60 So he went with pomp to Ptolemaʹis and met the two kings; he gave them and their friends silver and gold and many gifts, and found favor with them.
61 A group of pestilent men from Israel, lawless men, gathered together against him to accuse him; but the king paid no attention to them.
62 The king gave orders to take off Jonathan’s garments and to clothe him in purple, and they did so.
63 The king also seated him at his side; and he said to his officers, “Go forth with him into the middle of the city and proclaim that no one is to bring charges against him about any matter, and let no one annoy him for any reason.”
64 And when his accusers saw the honor that was paid him, in accordance with the proclamation, and saw him clothed in purple, they all fled.
65 Thus the king honored him and enrolled him among his chief friends, and made him general and governor of the province.
66 And Jonathan returned to Jerusalem in peace and gladness.
### Apollonius Is Defeated by Jonathan
67 In the one hundred and sixty-fifth year Demeʹtrius the son of Demeʹtrius came from Crete to the land of his fathers.
68 When Alexander the king heard of it, he was greatly grieved and returned to Antioch.
69 And Demeʹtrius appointed Apolloʹnius the governor of Coelesyria, and he assembled a large force and encamped against Jamʹnia. Then he sent the following message to Jonathan the high priest:
70 “You are the only one to rise up against us, and I have become a laughingstock and reproach because of you. Why do you assume authority against us in the hill country?
71 If you now have confidence in your forces, come down to the plain to meet us, and let us match strength with each other there, for I have with me the power of the cities.
72 Ask and learn who I am and who the others are that are helping us. Men will tell you that you cannot stand before us, for your fathers were twice put to flight in their own land.
73 And now you will not be able to withstand my cavalry and such an army in the plain, where there is no stone or pebble, or place to flee.”
74 When Jonathan heard the words of Apolloʹnius, his spirit was aroused. He chose ten thousand men and set out from Jerusalem, and Simon his brother met him to help him.
75 He encamped before Joppa, but the men of the city closed its gates, for Apolloʹnius had a garrison in Joppa.
76 So they fought against it, and the men of the city became afraid and opened the gates, and Jonathan gained possession of Joppa.
77 When Apolloʹnius heard of it, he mustered three thousand cavalry and a large army, and went to Azoʹtus as though he were going farther. At the same time he advanced into the plain, for he had a large troop of cavalry and put confidence in it.
78 Jonathan pursued him to Azoʹtus, and the armies engaged in battle.
79 Now Apolloʹnius had secretly left a thousand cavalry behind them.
80 Jonathan learned that there was an ambush behind him, for they surrounded his army and shot arrows at his men from early morning till late afternoon.
81 But his men stood fast, as Jonathan commanded, and the enemy’s horses grew tired.
82 Then Simon brought forward his force and engaged the phalanx in battle (for the cavalry was exhausted); they were overwhelmed by him and fled,
83 and the cavalry was dispersed in the plain. They fled to Azoʹtus and entered Beth-daʹgon, the temple of their idol, for safety.
84 But Jonathan burned Azoʹtus and the surrounding towns and plundered them; and the temple of Dagon, and those who had taken refuge in it he burned with fire.
85 The number of those who fell by the sword, with those burned alive, came to eight thousand men.
86 Then Jonathan departed from there and encamped against Asʹkalon, and the men of the city came out to meet him with great pomp.
87 And Jonathan and those with him returned to Jerusalem with much booty.
88 When Alexander the king heard of these things, he honored Jonathan still more;
89 and he sent to him a golden buckle, such as it is the custom to give to the kinsmen of kings. He also gave him Ekron and all its environs as his possession.


# Liber Primus Machabaeorum 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et anno centesimo sexagesimo, ascendit Alexander Antiochi filius, qui cognominatus est Nobilis, et occupavit Ptolemaidam: et receperunt eum, et regnavit illic.
2 Et audivit Demetrius rex, et congregavit exercitum copiosum valde, et exivit obviam illi in prælium.
3 Et misit Demetrius epistolam ad Jonathan verbis pacificis, ut magnificaret eum.
4 Dixit enim: Anticipemus facere pacem cum eo, priusquam faciat cum Alexandro adversum nos:
5 recordabitur enim omnium malorum, quæ fecimus in eum, et in fratrem ejus, et in gentem ejus.
6 Et dedit ei potestatem congregandi exercitum, et fabricare arma, et esse ipsum socium ejus: et obsides, qui erant in arce, jussit tradi ei.

7 Et venit Jonathas in Jerusalem, et legit epistolas in auditu omnis populi, et eorum qui in arce erant.
8 Et timuerunt timore magno, quoniam audierunt quod dedit ei rex potestatem congregandi exercitum.
9 Et traditi sunt Jonathæ obsides, et reddidit eos parentibus suis:
10 et habitavit Jonathas in Jerusalem, et cœpit ædificare et innovare civitatem.
11 Et dixit facientibus opera ut exstruerent muros, et montem Sion in circuitu lapidibus quadratis ad munitionem: et ita fecerunt.
12 Et fugerunt alienigenæ, qui erant in munitionibus quas Bacchides ædificaverat:
13 et reliquit unusquisque locum suum, et abiit in terram suam:
14 tantum in Bethsura remanserunt aliqui ex his qui reliquerant legem et præcepta Dei: erat enim hæc eis ad refugium.

15 Et audivit Alexander rex promissa, quæ promisit Demetrius Jonathæ: et narraverunt ei prælia, et virtutes quas ipse fecit, et fratres ejus, et labores quos laboraverunt:
16 et ait: Numquid inveniemus aliquem virum talem? et nunc faciemus eum amicum, et socium nostrum.
17 Et scripsit epistolam, et misit ei secundum hæc verba, dicens:
18 Rex Alexander fratri Jonathæ salutem.
19 Audivimus de te quod vir potens sis viribus, et aptus es ut sis amicus noster:
20 et nunc constituimus te hodie summum sacerdotem gentis tuæ, et ut amicus voceris regis (et misit ei purpuram, et coronam auream) et quæ nostra sunt sentias nobiscum, et conserves amicitias ad nos.
21 Et induit se Jonathas stola sancta septimo mense, anno centesimo sexagesimo, in die solemni scenopegiæ: et congregavit exercitum, et fecit arma copiosa.

22 Et audivit Demetrius verba ista, et contristatus est nimis, et ait:
23 Quid hoc fecimus, quod præoccupavit nos Alexander apprehendere amicitiam Judæorum ad munimen sui?
24 scribam et ego illis verba deprecatoria, et dignitates, et dona, ut sint mecum in adjutorium.
25 Et scripsit eis in hæc verba: Rex Demetrius genti Judæorum salutem.
26 Quoniam servastis ad nos pactum, et mansistis in amicitia nostra, et non accessistis ad inimicos nostros, audivimus, et gavisi sumus.
27 Et nunc perseverate adhuc conservare ad nos fidem, et retribuemus vobis bona pro his quæ fecistis nobiscum:
28 et remittemus vobis præstationes multas, et dabimus vobis donationes.

29 Et nunc absolvo vos et omnes Judæos a tributis, et pretia salis indulgeo, et coronas remitto, et tertias seminis:
30 et dimidiam partem fructus ligni, quod est portionis meæ, relinquo vobis ex hodierno die, et deinceps, ne accipiatur a terra Juda, et a tribus civitatibus quæ additæ sunt illi ex Samaria et Galilæa; ex hodierna die et in totum tempus:
31 et Jerusalem sit sancta, et libera cum finibus suis: et decimæ et tributa ipsius sint.
32 Remitto etiam potestatem arcis, quæ est in Jerusalem: et do eam summo sacerdoti, ut constituat in ea viros quoscumque ipse elegerit, qui custodiant eam.
33 Et omnem animam Judæorum, quæ captiva est a terra Juda in omni regno meo, relinquo liberam gratis, ut omnes a tributis solvantur, etiam pecorum suorum.
34 Et omnes dies solemnes, et sabbata, et neomeniæ, et dies decreti, et tres dies ante diem solemnem, et tres dies post diem solemnem, sint omnes immunitatis et remissionis omnibus Judæis, qui sunt in regno meo:
35 et nemo habebit potestatem agere aliquid, et movere negotia adversus aliquem illorum in omni causa.
36 Et ascribantur ex Judæis in exercitu regis ad triginta millia virorum: et dabuntur illis copiæ ut oportet omnibus exercitibus regis, et ex eis ordinabuntur qui sint in munitionibus regis magni:
37 et ex his constituentur super negotia regni, quæ aguntur ex fide, et principes sint ex eis, et ambulent in legibus suis, sicut præcepit rex in terra Juda.
38 Et tres civitates, quæ additæ sunt Judææ ex regione Samariæ, cum Judæa reputentur: ut sint sub uno, et non obediant alii potestati, nisi summi sacerdotis.

39 Ptolemaida et confines ejus, quas dedi donum sanctis qui sunt in Jerusalem, ad necessarios sumptus sanctorum.
40 Et ego do singulis annis quindecim millia siclorum argenti de rationibus regis, quæ me contingunt:
41 et omne quod reliquum fuerit, quod non reddiderant qui super negotia erant annis prioribus, ex hoc dabunt in opera domus.
42 Et super hæc quinque millia siclorum argenti, quæ accipiebant de sanctorum ratione per singulos annos: et hæc ad sacerdotes pertineant, qui ministerio funguntur.
43 Et quicumque confugerint in templum quod est Jerosolymis, et in omnibus finibus ejus, obnoxii regi in omni negotio dimittantur, et universa quæ sunt eis in regno meo, libera habeant.
44 Et ad ædificanda vel restauranda opera sanctorum, sumptus dabuntur de ratione regis:
45 et ad exstruendos muros Jerusalem, et communiendos in circuitu, sumptus dabuntur de ratione regis, et ad construendos muros in Judæa.

46 Ut audivit autem Jonathas et populus sermones istos, non crediderunt eis, nec receperunt eos: quia recordati sunt malitiæ magnæ, quam fecerat in Israël, et tribulaverat eos valde.
47 Et complacuit eis in Alexandrum, quia ipse fuerat eis princeps sermonum pacis, et ipsi auxilium ferebant omnibus diebus.
48 Et congregavit rex Alexander exercitum magnum, et admovit castra contra Demetrium.
49 Et commiserunt prælium duo reges, et fugit exercitus Demetrii, et insecutus est eum Alexander, et incubuit super eos.
50 Et invaluit prælium nimis, donec occidit sol: et cecidit Demetrius in die illa.

51 Et misit Alexander ad Ptolemæum regem Ægypti legatos secundum hæc verba, dicens:
52 Quoniam regressus sum in regnum meum, et sedi in sede patrum meorum, et obtinui principatum, et contrivi Demetrium, et possedi regionem nostram,
53 et commisi pugnam cum eo, et contritus est ipse et castra ejus a nobis, et sedimus in sede regni ejus:
54 et nunc statuamus ad invicem amicitiam: et da mihi filiam tuam uxorem, et ego ero gener tuus, et dabo tibi dona, et ipsi, digna te.
55 Et respondit rex Ptolemæus, dicens: Felix dies, in qua reversus es ad terram patrum tuorum, et sedisti in sede regni eorum.
56 Et nunc faciam tibi quod scripsisti: sed occurre mihi Ptolemaidam, ut videamus invicem nos, et spondeam tibi sicut dixisti.
57 Et exivit Ptolemæus de Ægypto, ipse et Cleopatra filia ejus, et venit Ptolemaidam anno centesimo sexagesimo secundo.
58 Et occurrit ei Alexander rex, et dedit ei Cleopatram filiam suam: et fecit nuntias ejus Ptolemaidæ, sicut reges in magna gloria.

59 Et scripsit rex Alexander Jonathæ, ut veniret obviam sibi.
60 Et abiit cum gloria Ptolemaidam, et occurrit ibi duobus regibus, et dedit illis argentum multum, et aurum, et dona: et invenit gratiam in conspectu eorum.
61 Et convenerunt adversus eum viri pestilentes ex Israël, viri iniqui interpellantes adversus eum: et non intendit ad eos rex.
62 Et jussit spoliari Jonathan vestibus suis, et indui eum purpura: et ita fecerunt. Et collocavit eum rex sedere secum.
63 Dixitque principibus suis: Exite cum eo in medium civitatis, et prædicate, ut nemo adversus eum interpellet de ullo negotio, nec quisquam ei molestus sit de ulla ratione.
64 Et factum est, ut viderunt qui interpellabant gloriam ejus, quæ prædicabatur, et opertum eum purpura, fugerunt omnes:
65 et magnificavit eum rex, et scripsit eum inter primos amicos, et posuit eum ducem, et participem principatus.
66 Et reversus est Jonathas in Jerusalem cum pace et lætitia.

67 In anno centesimo sexagesimo quinto, venit Demetrius filius Demetrii a Creta in terram patrum suorum.
68 Et audivit Alexander rex, et contristatus est valde, et reversus est Antiochum.
69 Et constituit Demetrius rex Apollonium ducem, qui præerat Cœlesyriæ: et congregavit exercitum magnum, et accessit ad Jamniam: et misit ad Jonathan summum sacerdotem,
70 dicens: Tu solus resistis nobis: ego autem factus sum in derisum, et in opprobrium, propterea quia tu potestatem adversum nos exerces in montibus.
71 Nunc ergo si confidis in virtutibus tuis, descende ad nos in campum, et comparemus illic invicem: quia mecum est virtus bellorum.
72 Interroga, et disce quis sum ego, et ceteri qui auxilio sunt mihi, qui et dicunt quia non potest stare pes vester ante faciem nostram, quia bis in fugam conversi sunt patres tui in terra sua:
73 et nunc quomodo poteris sustinere equitatum et exercitum tantum in campo, ubi non est lapis, neque saxum, neque locus fugiendi?

74 Ut audivit autem Jonathas sermones Apollonii, motus est animo: et elegit decem millia virorum, et exiit ab Jerusalem, et occurrit ei Simon frater ejus in adjutorium:
75 et applicuerunt castra in Joppen, et exclusit eum a civitate, quia custodia Apollonii Joppe erat: et oppugnavit eam.
76 Et exterriti qui erant in civitate, aperuerunt ei, et obtinuit Jonathas Joppen.
77 Et audivit Apollonius, et admovit tria millia equitum, et exercitum multum.
78 Et abiit Azotum tamquam iter faciens, et statim exiit in campum, eo quod haberet multitudinem equitum, et confideret in eis. Et insecutus est eum Jonathas in Azotum, et commiserunt prælium.

79 Et reliquit Apollonius in castris mille equites post eos occulte.
80 Et cognovit Jonathas quoniam insidiæ sunt post se, et circuierunt castra ejus, et jecerunt jacula in populum a mane usque ad vesperam.
81 Populus autem stabat, sicut præceperat Jonathas: et laboraverunt equi eorum.
82 Et ejecit Simon exercitum suum, et commisit contra legionem: equites enim fatigati erant: et contriti sunt ab eo, et fugerunt.
83 Et qui dispersi sunt per campum, fugerunt in Azotum, et intraverunt in Bethdagon idolum suum, ut ibi se liberarent.
84 Et succendit Jonathas Azotum, et civitates quæ erant in circuitu ejus, et accepit spolia eorum, et templum Dagon: et omnes qui fugerunt in illud, succendit igni.
85 Et fuerunt qui ceciderunt gladio, cum his qui succensi sunt, fere octo millia virorum.
86 Et movit inde Jonathas castra, et applicuit ea Ascalonem: et exierunt de civitate obviam illi in magna gloria.

87 Et reversus est Jonathas in Jerusalem cum suis, habentibus spolia multa.
88 Et factum est, ut audivit Alexander rex sermones istos, addidit adhuc glorificare Jonathan.
89 Et misit ei fibulam auream, sicut consuetudo est dari cognatis regum. Et dedit ei Accaron, et omnes fines ejus, in possessionem.

1 καὶ ἐν ἔτει ἑξηκοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ ἀνέβη Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ τοῦ Ἀντιόχου ὁ Ἐπιφανὴς καὶ κατελάβετο Πτολεμαίδα καὶ ἐπεδέξαντο αὐτόν καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐκεῖ
2 καὶ ἤκουσεν Δημήτριος ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ συνήγαγεν δυνάμεις πολλὰς σφόδρα καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ εἰς πόλεμον
3 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δημήτριος πρὸς Ιωναθαν ἐπιστολὰς λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς ὥστε μεγαλῦναι αὐτόν
4 εἶπεν γάρ προφθάσωμεν τοῦ εἰρήνην θεῖναι με{T'} αὐτῶν πρὶν ἢ θεῖναι αὐτὸν μετὰ Ἀλεξάνδρου κα{Q'} ἡμῶν

18 βασιλεὺς Ἀλέξανδρος τῷ ἀδελφῷ Ιωναθαν χαίρειν
19 ἀκηκόαμεν περὶ σοῦ ὅτι ἀνὴρ δυνατὸς ἰσχύι καὶ ἐπιτήδειος εἶ τοῦ εἶναι ἡμῶν φίλος
20 καὶ νῦν καθεστάκαμέν σε σήμερον ἀρχιερέα τοῦ ἔθνους σου καὶ φίλον βασιλέως καλεῖσθαί σε καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ πορφύραν καὶ στέφανον χρυσοῦν καὶ φρονεῖν τὰ ἡμῶν καὶ συντηρεῖν φιλίας πρὸς ἡμᾶς

26 ἐπεὶ συνετηρήσατε τὰς πρὸς ἡμᾶς συνθήκας καὶ ἐνεμείνατε τῇ φιλίᾳ ἡμῶν καὶ οὐ προσεχωρήσατε τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ἡμῶν ἠκούσαμεν καὶ ἐχάρημεν
27 καὶ νῦν ἐμμείνατε ἔτι τοῦ συντηρῆσαι πρὸς ἡμᾶς πίστιν καὶ ἀνταποδώσομεν ὑμῖν ἀγαθὰ ἀν{Q'} ὧν ποιεῖτε με{Q'} ἡμῶν
28 καὶ ἀφήσομεν ὑμῖν ἀφέματα πολλὰ καὶ δώσομεν ὑμῖν δόματα

29 καὶ νῦν ἀπολύω ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀφίημι πάντας τοὺς Ιουδαίους ἀπὸ τῶν φόρων καὶ τῆς τιμῆς τοῦ ἁλὸς καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν στεφάνων
30 καὶ ἀντὶ τοῦ τρίτου τῆς σπορᾶς καὶ ἀντὶ τοῦ ἡμίσους τοῦ καρποῦ τοῦ ξυλίνου τοῦ ἐπιβάλλοντός μοι λαβεῖν ἀφίημι ἀπὸ τῆς σήμερον καὶ ἐπέκεινα τοῦ λαβεῖν ἀπὸ γῆς Ιουδα καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν τριῶν νομῶν τῶν προστιθεμένων αὐτῇ ἀπὸ τῆς Σαμαρίτιδος καὶ Γαλιλαίας ἀπὸ τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας καὶ εἰς τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον
31 καὶ Ιερουσαλημ ἔστω ἁγία καὶ ἀφειμένη καὶ τὰ ὅρια αὐτῆς αἱ δεκάται καὶ τὰ τέλη
32 ἀφίημι καὶ τὴν ἐξουσίαν τῆς ἄκρας τῆς ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ δίδωμι τῷ ἀρχιερεῖ ὅπως ἂν καταστήσῃ ἐν αὐτῇ ἄνδρας οὓς ἂν αὐτὸς ἐκλέξηται τοῦ φυλάσσειν αὐτήν
33 καὶ πᾶσαν ψυχὴν Ιουδαίων τὴν αἰχμαλωτισθεῖσαν ἀπὸ γῆς Ιουδα εἰς πᾶσαν βασιλείαν μου ἀφίημι ἐλευθέραν δωρεάν καὶ πάντες ἀφιέτωσαν τοὺς φόρους καὶ τῶν κτηνῶν αὐτῶν
34 καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ἑορταὶ καὶ τὰ σάββατα καὶ νουμηνίαι καὶ ἡμέραι ἀποδεδειγμέναι καὶ τρεῖς ἡμέραι πρὸ ἑορτῆς καὶ τρεῖς μετὰ ἑορτὴν ἔστωσαν πᾶσαι ἡμέραι ἀτελείας καὶ ἀφέσεως πᾶσιν τοῖς Ιουδαίοις τοῖς οὖσιν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου
35 καὶ οὐχ ἕξει ἐξουσίαν οὐδεὶς πράσσειν καὶ παρενοχλεῖν τινα αὐτῶν περὶ παντὸς πράγματος
36 καὶ προγραφήτωσαν τῶν Ιουδαίων εἰς τὰς δυνάμεις τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς τριάκοντα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν καὶ δοθήσεται αὐτοῖς ξένια ὡς καθήκει πάσαις ταῖς δυνάμεσιν τοῦ βασιλέως
37 καὶ κατασταθήσεται ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς ὀχυρώμασιν τοῦ βασιλέως τοῖς μεγάλοις καὶ ἐκ τούτων κατασταθήσονται ἐπὶ χρειῶν τῆς βασιλείας τῶν οὐσῶν εἰς πίστιν καὶ οἱ ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ἔστωσαν ἐξ αὐτῶν καὶ πορευέσθωσαν τοῖς νόμοις αὐτῶν καθὰ καὶ προσέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν γῇ Ιουδα
38 καὶ τοὺς τρεῖς νομοὺς τοὺς προστεθέντας τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ ἀπὸ τῆς χώρας Σαμαρείας προστεθήτω τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ πρὸς τὸ λογισθῆναι τοῦ γενέσθαι ὑ{F'} ἕνα τοῦ μὴ ὑπακοῦσαι ἄλλης ἐξουσίας ἀλ{L'} ἢ τοῦ ἀρχιερέως

39 Πτολεμαίδα καὶ τὴν προσκυροῦσαν αὐτῇ δέδωκα δόμα τοῖς ἁγίοις τοῖς ἐν Ιερουσαλημ εἰς τὴν καθήκουσαν δαπάνην τοῖς ἁγίοις
40 κἀγὼ δίδωμι κα{T'} ἐνιαυτὸν δέκα πέντε χιλιάδας σίκλων ἀργυρίου ἀπὸ τῶν λόγων τοῦ βασιλέως ἀπὸ τῶν τόπων τῶν ἀνηκόντων
41 καὶ πᾶν τὸ πλεονάζον ὃ οὐκ ἀπεδίδοσαν ἀπὸ τῶν χρειῶν ὡς ἐν τοῖς πρώτοις ἔτεσιν ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν δώσουσιν εἰς τὰ ἔργα τοῦ οἴκου
42 καὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις πεντακισχιλίους σίκλους ἀργυρίου οὓς ἐλάμβανον ἀπὸ τῶν χρειῶν τοῦ ἁγίου ἀπὸ τοῦ λόγου κα{T'} ἐνιαυτόν καὶ ταῦτα ἀφίεται διὰ τὸ ἀνήκειν αὐτὰ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν τοῖς λειτουργοῦσιν
43 καὶ ὅσοι ἐὰν φύγωσιν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν τὸ ἐν Ιεροσολύμοις καὶ ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτοῦ ὀφείλων βασιλικὰ καὶ πᾶν πρᾶγμα ἀπολελύσθωσαν καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου
44 καὶ τοῦ οἰκοδομηθῆναι καὶ ἐπικαινισθῆναι τὰ ἔργα τῶν ἁγίων καὶ ἡ δαπάνη δοθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λόγου τοῦ βασιλέως
45 καὶ τοῦ οἰκοδομηθῆναι τὰ τείχη Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὀχυρῶσαι κυκλόθεν καὶ ἡ δαπάνη δοθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λόγου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τοῦ οἰκοδομηθῆναι τὰ τείχη ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ

46 ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν Ιωναθαν καὶ ὁ λαὸς τοὺς λόγους τούτους οὐκ ἐπίστευσαν αὐτοῖς οὐδὲ ἐπεδέξαντο ὅτι ἐπεμνήσθησαν τῆς κακίας τῆς μεγάλης ἧς ἐποίησεν ἐν Ισραηλ καὶ ἔθλιψεν αὐτοὺς σφόδρα
47 καὶ εὐδόκησαν ἐν Ἀλεξάνδρῳ ὅτι αὐτὸς ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς ἀρχηγὸς λόγων εἰρηνικῶν καὶ συνεμάχουν αὐτῷ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
48 καὶ συνήγαγεν Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ βασιλεὺς δυνάμεις μεγάλας καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐξ ἐναντίας Δημητρίου
49 καὶ συνῆψαν πόλεμον οἱ δύο βασιλεῖς καὶ ἔφυγεν ἡ παρεμβολὴ Δημητρίου καὶ ἐδίωξεν αὐτὸν ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος καὶ ἴσχυσεν ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
50 καὶ ἐστερέωσεν τὸν πόλεμον σφόδρα ἕως ἔδυ ὁ ἥλιος καὶ ἔπεσεν ὁ Δημήτριος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ

51 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἀλέξανδρος πρὸς Πτολεμαῖον βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου πρέσβεις κατὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους λέγων
52 ἐπεὶ ἀνέστρεψα εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν μου καὶ ἐνεκάθισα ἐπὶ θρόνου πατέρων μου καὶ ἐκράτησα τῆς ἀρχῆς καὶ συνέτριψα τὸν Δημήτριον καὶ ἐπεκράτησα τῆς χώρας ἡμῶν
53 καὶ συνῆψα πρὸς αὐτὸν μάχην καὶ συνετρίβη αὐτὸς καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ ὑ{F'} ἡμῶν καὶ ἐκαθίσαμεν ἐπὶ θρόνου βασιλείας αὐτοῦ
54 καὶ νῦν στήσωμεν πρὸς αὑτοὺς φιλίαν καὶ νῦν δός μοι τὴν θυγατέρα σου εἰς γυναῖκα καὶ ἐπιγαμβρεύσω σοι καὶ δώσω σοι δόματα καὶ αὐτῇ ἄξιά σου
55 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Πτολεμαῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς λέγων ἀγαθὴ ἡμέρα ἐν ᾗ ἐπέστρεψας εἰς γῆν πατέρων σου καὶ ἐκάθισας ἐπὶ θρόνου βασιλείας αὐτῶν
56 καὶ νῦν ποιήσω σοι ἃ ἔγραψας ἀλλὰ ἀπάντησον εἰς Πτολεμαίδα ὅπως ἴδωμεν ἀλλήλους καὶ ἐπιγαμβρεύσω σοι καθὼς εἴρηκας
57 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Πτολεμαῖος ἐξ Αἰγύπτου αὐτὸς καὶ Κλεοπάτρα ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Πτολεμαίδα ἔτους δευτέρου καὶ ἑξηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ
58 καὶ ἀπήντησεν αὐτῷ Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ βασιλεύς καὶ ἐξέδετο αὐτῷ Κλεοπάτραν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸν γάμον αὐτῆς ἐν Πτολεμαίδι καθὼς οἱ βασιλεῖς ἐν δόξῃ μεγάλῃ

59 καὶ ἔγραψεν Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ βασιλεὺς Ιωναθη ἐλθεῖν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ
60 καὶ ἐπορεύθη μετὰ δόξης εἰς Πτολεμαίδα καὶ ἀπήντησεν τοῖς δυσὶν βασιλεῦσι καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ τοῖς φίλοις αὐτῶν καὶ δόματα πολλὰ καὶ εὗρεν χάριν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν
61 καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν ἄνδρες λοιμοὶ ἐξ Ισραηλ ἄνδρες παράνομοι ἐντυχεῖν κα{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐ προσέσχεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς
62 καὶ προσέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ ἐξέδυσαν Ιωναθαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐνέδυσαν αὐτὸν πορφύραν καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως
63 καὶ ἐκάθισεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς ἄρχουσιν αὐτοῦ ἐξέλθατε με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἰς μέσον τῆς πόλεως καὶ κηρύξατε τοῦ μηδένα ἐντυγχάνειν κα{T'} αὐτοῦ περὶ μηδενὸς πράγματος καὶ μηδεὶς αὐτῷ παρενοχλείτω περὶ παντὸς λόγου
64 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδον οἱ ἐντυγχάνοντες τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ καθὼς ἐκήρυξεν καὶ περιβεβλημένον αὐτὸν πορφύραν καὶ ἔφυγον πάντες
65 καὶ ἐδόξασεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ ἔγραψεν αὐτὸν τῶν πρώτων φίλων καὶ ἔθετο αὐτὸν στρατηγὸν καὶ μεριδάρχην
66 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ιωναθαν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ με{T'} εἰρήνης καὶ εὐφροσύνης

67 καὶ ἐν ἔτει πέμπτῳ καὶ ἑξηκοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ ἦλθεν Δημήτριος υἱὸς Δημητρίου ἐκ Κρήτης εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ
68 καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ ἐλυπήθη σφόδρα καὶ ὑπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν
69 καὶ κατέστησεν Δημήτριος Ἀπολλώνιον τὸν ὄντα ἐπὶ Κοίλης Συρίας καὶ συνήγαγεν δύναμιν μεγάλην καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ Ιάμνειαν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς Ιωναθαν τὸν ἀρχιερέα λέγων
70 σὺ μονώτατος ἐπαίρῃ ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς ἐγὼ δὲ ἐγενήθην εἰς καταγέλωτα καὶ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν διὰ σέ καὶ διὰ τί σὺ ἐξουσιάζῃ ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι
71 νῦν οὖν εἰ πέποιθας ἐπὶ ταῖς δυνάμεσίν σου κατάβηθι πρὸς ἡμᾶς εἰς τὸ πεδίον καὶ συγκριθῶμεν ἑαυτοῖς ἐκεῖ ὅτι με{T'} ἐμοῦ ἐστιν δύναμις τῶν πόλεων
72 ἐρώτησον καὶ μάθε τίς εἰμι καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ οἱ βοηθοῦντες ἡμῖν καὶ λέγουσιν οὐκ ἔστιν ὑμῖν στάσις ποδὸς κατὰ πρόσωπον ἡμῶν ὅτι δὶς ἐτροπώθησαν οἱ πατέρες σου ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν
73 καὶ νῦν οὐ δυνήσῃ ὑποστῆναι τὴν ἵππον καὶ δύναμιν τοιαύτην ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ὅπου οὐκ ἔστιν λίθος οὐδὲ κόχλαξ οὐδὲ τόπος τοῦ φυγεῖν

74 ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν Ιωναθαν τῶν λόγων Ἀπολλωνίου ἐκινήθη τῇ διανοίᾳ καὶ ἐπέλεξεν δέκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ συνήντησεν αὐτῷ Σιμων ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ βοήθειαν αὐτῷ
75 καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ Ιοππην καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν αὐτὴν οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὅτι φρουρὰ Ἀπολλωνίου ἐν Ιοππη καὶ ἐπολέμησαν αὐτήν
76 καὶ φοβηθέντες ἤνοιξαν οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐκυρίευσεν Ιωναθαν Ιοππης
77 καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἀπολλώνιος καὶ παρενέβαλεν τρισχιλίαν ἵππον καὶ δύναμιν πολλὴν καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Ἄζωτον ὡς διοδεύων καὶ ἅμα προῆγεν εἰς τὸ πεδίον διὰ τὸ ἔχειν αὐτὸν πλῆθος ἵππου καὶ πεποιθέναι ἐ{P'} αὐτῇ
78 καὶ κατεδίωξεν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἄζωτον καὶ συνῆψαν αἱ παρεμβολαὶ εἰς πόλεμον

79 καὶ ἀπέλιπεν Απολλώνιος χιλίαν ἵππον κρυπτῶς κατόπισθεν αὐτῶν
80 καὶ ἔγνω Ιωναθαν ὅτι ἔστιν ἔνεδρον κατόπισθεν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν αὐτοῦ τὴν παρεμβολὴν καὶ ἐξετίναξαν τὰς σχίζας εἰς τὸν λαὸν ἐκ πρωίθεν ἕως δείλης
81 ὁ δὲ λαὸς εἱστήκει καθὼς ἐπέταξεν Ιωναθαν καὶ ἐκοπίασαν οἱ ἵπποι αὐτῶν
82 καὶ εἵλκυσεν Σιμων τὴν δύναμιν αὐτοῦ καὶ συνῆψεν πρὸς τὴν φάλαγγα ἡ γὰρ ἵππος ἐξελύθη καὶ συνετρίβησαν ὑ{P'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφυγον
83 καὶ ἡ ἵππος ἐσκορπίσθη ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς Ἄζωτον καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς Βηθδαγων τὸ εἰδώλιον αὐτῶν τοῦ σωθῆναι
84 καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν Ιωναθαν τὴν Ἄζωτον καὶ τὰς πόλεις τὰς κύκλῳ αὐτῆς καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν Δαγων καὶ τοὺς συμφυγόντας εἰς αὐτὸ ἐνεπύρισεν πυρί
85 καὶ ἐγένοντο οἱ πεπτωκότες μαχαίρᾳ σὺν τοῖς ἐμπυρισθεῖσιν εἰς ἄνδρας ὀκτακισχιλίους
86 καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἐκεῖθεν Ιωναθαν καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ Ἀσκαλῶνα καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ ἐν δόξῃ μεγάλῃ

87 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ιωναθαν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ σὺν τοῖς πα{R'} αὐτοῦ ἔχοντες σκῦλα πολλά
88 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ προσέθετο ἔτι δοξάσαι τὸν Ιωναθαν
89 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ πόρπην χρυσῆν ὡς ἔθος ἐστὶν δίδοσθαι τοῖς συγγενέσιν τῶν βασιλέων καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τὴν Ακκαρων καὶ πάντα τὰ ὅρια αὐτῆς εἰς κληροδοσίαν
