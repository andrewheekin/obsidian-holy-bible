# First Book of Maccabees 12 (RSVCE)

### Alliances with Rome and Sparta
1 Now when Jonathan saw that the time was favorable for him, he chose men and sent them to Rome to confirm and renew the friendship with them.
2 He also sent letters to the same effect to the Spartans and to other places.
3 So they went to Rome and entered the senate chamber and said, “Jonathan the high priest and the Jewish nation have sent us to renew the former friendship and alliance with them.”
4 And the Romans gave them letters to the people in every place, asking them to provide for the envoys safe conduct to the land of Judah.
5 This is a copy of the letter which Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:
6 “Jonathan the high priest, the senate of the nation, the priests, and the rest of the Jewish people to their brethren the Spartans, greeting.
7 Already in time past a letter was sent to Oniʹas the high priest from Ariʹus, who was king among you, stating that you are our brethren, as the appended copy shows.
8 Oniʹas welcomed the envoy with honor, and received the letter, which contained a clear declaration of alliance and friendship.
9 Therefore, though we have no need of these things, since we have as encouragement the holy books which are in our hands,
10 we have undertaken to send to renew our brotherhood and friendship with you, so that we may not become estranged from you, for considerable time has passed since you sent your letter to us.
11 We therefore remember you constantly on every occasion, both in our feasts and on other appropriate days, at the sacrifices which we offer and in our prayers, as it is right and proper to remember brethren.
12 And we rejoice in your glory.
13 But as for ourselves, many afflictions and many wars have encircled us; the kings round about us have waged war against us.
14 We were unwilling to annoy you and our other allies and friends with these wars,
15 for we have the help which comes from Heaven for our aid; and we were delivered from our enemies and our enemies were humbled.
16 We therefore have chosen Numeʹnius the son of Antiʹochus and Antipʹater the son of Jason, and have sent them to Rome to renew our former friendship and alliance with them.
17 We have commanded them to go also to you and greet you and deliver to you this letter from us concerning the renewal of our brotherhood.
18 And now please send us a reply to this.”
19 This is a copy of the letter which they sent to Oniʹas:
20 “Ariʹus, king of the Spartans, to Oniʹas the high priest, greeting.
21 It has been found in writing concerning the Spartans and the Jews that they are brethren and are of the family of Abraham.
22 And now that we have learned this, please write us concerning your welfare;
23 we on our part write to you that your cattle and your property belong to us, and ours belong to you. We therefore command that our envoys report to you accordingly.”
### Further Campaigns of Jonathan and Simon
24 Now Jonathan heard that the commanders of Demeʹtrius had returned, with a larger force than before, to wage war against him.
25 So he marched away from Jerusalem and met them in the region of Hamath, for he gave them no opportunity to invade his own country.
26 He sent spies to their camp, and they returned and reported to him that the enemy were being drawn up in formation to fall upon the Jews by night.
27 So when the sun set, Jonathan commanded his men to be alert and to keep their arms at hand so as to be ready all night for battle, and he stationed outposts around the camp.
28 When the enemy heard that Jonathan and his men were prepared for battle, they were afraid and were terrified at heart; so they kindled fires in their camp and withdrew.
29 But Jonathan and his men did not know it until morning, for they saw the fires burning.
30 Then Jonathan pursued them, but he did not overtake them, for they had crossed the Eleuʹtherus river.
31 So Jonathan turned aside against the Arabs who are called Zabadeʹans, and he crushed them and plundered them.
32 Then he broke camp and went to Damasʹcus, and marched through all that region.
33 Simon also went forth and marched through the country as far as Asʹkalon and the neighboring strongholds. He turned aside to Joppa and took it by surprise,
34 for he had heard that they were ready to hand over the stronghold to the men whom Demeʹtrius had sent. And he stationed a garrison there to guard it.
35 When Jonathan returned he convened the elders of the people and planned with them to build strongholds in Judea,
36 to build the walls of Jerusalem still higher, and to erect a high barrier between the citadel and the city to separate it from the city, in order to isolate it so that its garrison could neither buy nor sell.
37 So they gathered together to build up the city; part of the wall on the valley to the east had fallen, and he repaired the section called Chaphenaʹtha.
38 And Simon built Adʹida in the Shepheʹlah; he fortified it and installed gates with bolts.
### Trypho Captures Jonathan
39 Then Trypho attempted to become king of Asia and put on the crown, and to raise his hand against Antiʹochus the king.
40 He feared that Jonathan might not permit him to do so, but might make war on him, so he kept seeking to seize and kill him, and he marched forth and came to Beth-shan.
41 Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand picked fighting men, and he came to Beth-shan.
42 When Trypho saw that he had come with a large army, he was afraid to raise his hand against him.
43 So he received him with honor and commended him to all his friends, and he gave him gifts and commanded his friends and his troops to obey him as they would himself.
44 Then he said to Jonathan, “Why have you wearied all these people when we are not at war?
45 Dismiss them now to their homes and choose for yourself a few men to stay with you, and come with me to Ptolemaʹis. I will hand it over to you as well as the other strongholds and the remaining troops and all the officials, and will turn round and go home. For that is why I am here.”
46 Jonathan trusted him and did as he said; he sent away the troops, and they returned to the land of Judah.
47 He kept with himself three thousand men, two thousand of whom he left in Galilee, while a thousand accompanied him.
48 But when Jonathan entered Ptolemaʹis, the men of Ptolemaʹis closed the gates and seized him, and all who had entered with him they killed with the sword.
49 Then Trypho sent troops and cavalry into Galilee and the Great Plain to destroy all Jonathan’s soldiers.
50 But they realized that Jonathan had been seized and had perished along with his men, and they encouraged one another and kept marching in close formation, ready for battle.
51 When their pursuers saw that they would fight for their lives, they turned back.
52 So they all reached the land of Judah safely, and they mourned for Jonathan and his companions and were in great fear; and all Israel mourned deeply.
53 And all the nations round about them tried to destroy them, for they said, “They have no leader or helper. Now therefore let us make war on them and blot out the memory of them from among men.”


# Liber Primus Machabaeorum 12 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et vidit Jonathas quia tempus eum juvat, et elegit viros, et misit eos Romam statuere et renovare cum eis amicitiam:
2 et ad Spartiatas, et ad alia loca misit epistolas secundum eamdem formam:
3 et abierunt Romam, et intraverunt curiam, et dixerunt: Jonathas summus sacerdos, et gens Judæorum miserunt nos, ut renovaremus amicitiam et societatem secundum pristinum.
4 Et dederunt illis epistolas ad ipsos per loca, ut deducerent eos in terram Juda cum pace.

5 Et hoc est exemplum epistolarum, quas scripsit Jonathas Spartiatis:
6 Jonathas summus sacerdos, et seniores gentis, et sacerdotes, et reliquus populus Judæorum, Spartiatis fratribus salutem.
7 Jampridem missæ erant epistolæ ad Oniam summum sacerdotem ab Ario, qui regnabat apud vos, quoniam estis fratres nostri, sicut rescriptum continet, quod subjectum est.
8 Et suscepit Onias virum, qui missus fuerat, cum honore: et accepit epistolas, in quibus significabatur de societate et amicitia.
9 Nos cum nullo horum indigeremus, habentes solatio sanctos libros, qui sunt in manibus nostris,
10 maluimus mittere ad vos renovare fraternitatem et amicitiam, ne forte alieni efficiamur a vobis: multa enim tempora transierunt, ex quo misistis ad nos.
11 Nos ergo in omni tempore sine intermissione in diebus solemnibus, et ceteris, quibus oportet, memores sumus vestri in sacrificiis quæ offerimus, et in observationibus, sicut fas est, et decet meminisse fratrum.
12 Lætamur itaque de gloria vestra.
13 Nos autem circumdederunt multæ tribulationes, et multa prælia, et impugnaverunt nos reges qui sunt in circuitu nostro.
14 Noluimus ergo vobis molesti esse, neque ceteris sociis et amicis nostris in his præliis:
15 habuimus enim de cælo auxilium, et liberati sumus nos, et humiliati sunt inimici nostri.
16 Elegimus itaque Numenium Antiochi filium, et Antipatrem Jasonis filium, et misimus ad Romanos renovare cum eis amicitiam et societatem pristinam.
17 Mandavimus itaque eis ut veniant etiam ad vos, et salutent vos, et reddant vobis epistolas nostras de innovatione fraternitatis nostræ.
18 Et nunc benefacietis respondentes nobis ad hæc.

19 Et hoc est rescriptum epistolarum quod miserat Oniæ:
20 Arius rex Spartiatarum Oniæ sacerdoti magno salutem.
21 Inventum est in scriptura de Spartiatis, et Judæis, quoniam sunt fratres, et quod sunt de genere Abraham.
22 Et nunc ex quo hæc cognovimus, benefacitis scribentes nobis de pace vestra.
23 Sed et nos rescripsimus vobis: Pecora nostra, et possessiones nostræ, vestræ sunt: et vestræ, nostræ: mandavimus itaque hæc nuntiari vobis.

24 Et audivit Jonathas quoniam regressi sunt principes Demetrii cum exercitu multo supra quam prius, pugnare adversus eum:
25 et exiit ab Jerusalem, et occurrit eis in Amathite regione: non enim dederat eis spatium ut ingrederentur regionem ejus.
26 Et misit speculatores in castra eorum: et reversi renuntiaverunt quod constituunt supervenire illis nocte.
27 Cum occidisset autem sol, præcepit Jonathas suis vigilare, et esse in armis paratos ad pugnam tota nocte: et posuit custodes per circuitum castrorum.
28 Et audierunt adversarii quod paratus est Jonathas cum suis in bello: et timuerunt, et formidaverunt in corde suo: et accenderunt focos in castris suis.
29 Jonathas autem, et qui cum eo erant, non cognoverunt usque mane: videbant autem luminaria ardentia,
30 et secutus est eos Jonathas, et non comprehendit eos: transierant enim flumen Eleutherum.
31 Et divertit Jonathas ad Arabas, qui vocantur Zabadæi: et percussit eos, et accepit spolia eorum.
32 Et junxit, et venit Damascum, et perambulabat omnem regionem illam.
33 Simon autem exiit, et venit usque ad Ascalonem, et ad proxima præsidia: et declinavit in Joppen, et occupavit eam
34 (audivit enim quod vellent præsidium tradere partibus Demetrii), et posuit ibi custodes ut custodirent eam.

35 Et reversus est Jonathas, et convocavit seniores populi, et cogitavit cum eis ædificare præsidia in Judæa,
36 et ædificare muros in Jerusalem, et exaltare altitudinem magnam inter medium arcis et civitatis, ut separaret eam a civitate, ut esset ipsa singulariter, et neque emant, neque vendant.
37 Et convenerunt ut ædificarent civitatem: et cecidit murus qui erat super torrentem ab ortu solis, et reparavit eum, qui vocatur Caphetetha:
38 et Simon ædificavit Adiada in Sephela, et munivit eam, et imposuit portas et seras.

39 Et cum cogitasset Tryphon regnare Asiæ, et assumere diadema, et extendere manum in Antiochum regem:
40 timens ne forte non permitteret eum Jonathas, sed pugnaret adversus eum, quærebat comprehendere eum, et occidere. Et exsurgens abiit in Bethsan.
41 Et exivit Jonathas obviam illi cum quadraginta millibus virorum electorum in prælium, et venit Bethsan.
42 Et vidit Tryphon quia venit Jonathas cum exercitu multo ut extenderet in eum manus: timuit,
43 et excepit eum cum honore, et commendavit eum omnibus amicis suis, et dedit ei munera: et præcepit exercitibus suis ut obedirent ei, sicut sibi.
44 Et dixit Jonathæ: Ut quid vexasti universum populum, cum bellum nobis non sit?
45 et nunc remitte eos in domos suas: elige autem tibi viros paucos, qui tecum sint, et veni mecum Ptolemaidam, et tradam eam tibi, et reliqua præsidia, et exercitum, et universos præpositos negotii: et conversus abibo: propterea enim veni.

46 Et credidit ei, et fecit sicut dixit: et dimisit exercitum, et abierunt in terram Juda.
47 Retinuit autem secum tria millia virorum: ex quibus remisit in Galilæam duo millia: mille autem venerunt cum eo.
48 Ut autem intravit Ptolemaidam Jonathas, clauserunt portas civitatis Ptolemenses, et comprehenderunt eum: et omnes qui cum eo intraverant, gladio interfecerunt.
49 Et misit Tryphon exercitum et equites in Galilæam et in campum magnum, ut perderent omnes socios Jonathæ.
50 At illi cum cognovissent quia comprehensus est Jonathas, et periit, et omnes qui cum eo erant, hortati sunt semetipsos, et exierunt parati in prælium.
51 Et videntes hi qui insecuti fuerant, quia pro anima res est illis, reversi sunt:
52 illi autem venerunt omnes cum pace in terram Juda. Et planxerunt Jonathan, et eos qui cum ipso fuerant, valde: et luxit Israël luctu magno.
53 Et quæsierunt omnes gentes quæ erant in circuitu eorum conterere eos: dixerunt enim:
54 Non habent principem et adjuvantem: nunc ergo expugnemus illos, et tollamus de hominibus memoriam eorum.

24 καὶ ἤκουσεν Ιωναθαν ὅτι ἐπέστρεψαν οἱ ἄρχοντες Δημητρίου μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς ὑπὲρ τὸ πρότερον τοῦ πολεμῆσαι πρὸς αὐτόν
25 καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἀπήντησεν αὐτοῖς εἰς τὴν Αμαθῖτιν χώραν οὐ γὰρ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἀνοχὴν τοῦ ἐμβατεῦσαι εἰς τὴν χώραν αὐτοῦ
26 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν κατασκόπους εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ ὅτι οὕτως τάσσονται ἐπιπεσεῖν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς τὴν νύκτα
27 ὡς δὲ ἔδυ ὁ ἥλιος ἐπέταξεν Ιωναθαν τοῖς πα{R'} αὐτοῦ γρηγορεῖν καὶ εἶναι ἐπὶ τοῖς ὅπλοις ἑτοιμάζεσθαι εἰς πόλεμον δ{I'} ὅλης τῆς νυκτὸς καὶ ἐξέβαλεν προφύλακας κύκλῳ τῆς παρεμβολῆς
28 καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ ὑπεναντίοι ὅτι ἡτοίμασται Ιωναθαν καὶ οἱ πα{R'} αὐτοῦ εἰς πόλεμον καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν καὶ ἔπτηξαν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνέκαυσαν πυρὰς ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ αὐτῶν
29 Ιωναθαν δὲ καὶ οἱ πα{R'} αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ἕως πρωί ἔβλεπον γὰρ τὰ φῶτα καιόμενα
30 καὶ κατεδίωξεν Ιωναθαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν καὶ οὐ κατέλαβεν αὐτούς διέβησαν γὰρ τὸν Ἐλεύθερον ποταμόν

35 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ιωναθαν καὶ ἐξεκκλησίασεν τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ἐβουλεύετο με{T'} αὐτῶν τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι ὀχυρώματα ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ
36 καὶ προσυψῶσαι τὰ τείχη Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὑψῶσαι ὕψος μέγα ἀνὰ μέσον τῆς ἄκρας καὶ τῆς πόλεως εἰς τὸ διαχωρίζειν αὐτὴν τῆς πόλεως ἵνα ᾖ αὕτη κατὰ μόνας ὅπως μήτε ἀγοράζωσιν μήτε πωλῶσιν

49 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Τρύφων δυνάμεις καὶ ἵππον εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν καὶ τὸ πεδίον τὸ μέγα τοῦ ἀπολέσαι πάντας τοὺς παρὰ Ιωναθου
50 καὶ ἐπέγνωσαν ὅτι συνελήμφθη καὶ ἀπόλωλεν καὶ οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ παρεκάλεσαν ἑαυτοὺς καὶ ἐπορεύοντο συνεστραμμένοι ἕτοιμοι εἰς πόλεμον
51 καὶ εἶδον οἱ διώκοντες ὅτι περὶ ψυχῆς αὐτοῖς ἐστιν καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν
52 καὶ ἦλθον πάντες με{T'} εἰρήνης εἰς γῆν Ιουδα καὶ ἐπένθησαν τὸν Ιωναθαν καὶ τοὺς με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα καὶ ἐπένθησεν πᾶς Ισραηλ πένθος μέγα
53 καὶ ἐζήτησαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ αὐτῶν ἐκτρῖψαι αὐτούς εἶπον γάρ
54 οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἄρχοντα καὶ βοηθοῦντα νῦν οὖν πολεμήσωμεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐξάρωμεν ἐξ ἀνθρώπων τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν
