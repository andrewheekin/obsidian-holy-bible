# First Book of Maccabees 9 (RSVCE)

### Bacchides Returns to Judea
1 When Demeʹtrius heard that Nicaʹnor and his army had fallen in battle, he sent Bacʹchides and Alʹcimus into the land of Judah a second time, and with them the right wing of the army.
2 They went by the road which leads to Gilgal and encamped against Mesʹaloth in Arbeʹla, and they took it and killed many people.
3 In the first month of the one hundred and fifty-second year they encamped against Jerusalem;
4 then they marched off and went to Berea with twenty thousand foot soldiers and two thousand cavalry.
5 Now Judas was encamped in Elʹasa, and with him were three thousand picked men.
6 When they saw the huge number of the enemy forces, they were greatly frightened, and many slipped away from the camp, until no more than eight hundred of them were left.
7 When Judas saw that his army had slipped away and the battle was imminent, he was crushed in spirit, for he had no time to assemble them.
8 He became faint, but he said to those who were left, “Let us rise and go up against our enemies. We may be able to fight them.”
9 But they tried to dissuade him, saying, “We are not able. Let us rather save our own lives now, and let us come back with our brethren and fight them; we are too few.”
10 But Judas said, “Far be it from us to do such a thing as to flee from them. If our time has come, let us die bravely for our brethren, and leave no cause to question our honor.”
### The Last Battle of Judas
11 Then the army of Bacʹchides marched out from the camp and took its stand for the encounter. The cavalry was divided into two companies, and the slingers and the archers went ahead of the army, as did all the chief warriors.
12 Bacʹchides was on the right wing. Flanked by the two companies, the phalanx advanced to the sound of the trumpets; and the men with Judas also blew their trumpets.
13 The earth was shaken by the noise of the armies, and the battle raged from morning till evening.
14 Judas saw that Bacʹchides and the strength of his army were on the right; then all the stouthearted men went with him,
15 and they crushed the right wing, and he pursued them as far as Mount Azoʹtus.
16 When those on the left wing saw that the right wing was crushed, they turned and followed close behind Judas and his men.
17 The battle became desperate, and many on both sides were wounded and fell.
18 Judas also fell, and the rest fled.
19 Then Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother and buried him in the tomb of their fathers at Moʹde-in,
20 and wept for him. And all Israel made great lamentation for him; they mourned many days and said,
21 “How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel!”
22 Now the rest of the acts of Judas, and his wars and the brave deeds that he did, and his greatness, have not been recorded, for they were very many.
### Jonathan Succeeds Judas
23 After the death of Judas, the lawless emerged in all parts of Israel; all the doers of injustice appeared.
24 In those days a very great famine occurred, and the country deserted with them to the enemy.
25 And Bacʹchides chose the ungodly and put them in charge of the country.
26 They sought and searched for the friends of Judas, and brought them to Bacʹchides, and he took vengeance on them and made sport of them.
27 Thus there was great distress in Israel, such as had not been since the time that prophets ceased to appear among them.
28 Then all the friends of Judas assembled and said to Jonathan,
29 “Since the death of your brother Judas there has been no one like him to go against our enemies and Bacʹchides, and to deal with those of our nation who hate us.
30 So now we have chosen you today to take his place as our ruler and leader, to fight our battle.”
31 And Jonathan at that time accepted the leadership and took the place of Judas his brother.
### The Campaigns of Jonathan
32 When Bacʹchides learned of this, he tried to kill him.
33 But Jonathan and Simon his brother and all who were with him heard of it, and they fled into the wilderness of Tekoʹa and camped by the water of the pool of Asphar.
34 Bacʹchides found this out on the sabbath day, and he with all his army crossed the Jordan.
35 And Jonathan sent his brother as leader of the multitude and begged the Nabateʹans, who were his friends, for permission to store with them the great amount of baggage which they had.
36 But the sons of Jambri from Meʹdeba came out and seized John and all that he had, and departed with it.
37 After these things it was reported to Jonathan and Simon his brother, “The sons of Jambri are celebrating a great wedding, and are conducting the bride, a daughter of one of the great nobles of Canaan, from Nadʹabath with a large escort.”
38 And they remembered the blood of John their brother, and went up and hid under cover of the mountain.
39 They raised their eyes and looked, and saw a tumultuous procession with much baggage; and the bridegroom came out with his friends and his brothers to meet them with tambourines and musicians and many weapons.
40 Then they rushed upon them from the ambush and began killing them. Many were wounded and fell, and the rest fled to the mountain; and they took all their goods.
41 Thus the wedding was turned into mourning and the voice of their musicians into a funeral dirge.
42 And when they had fully avenged the blood of their brother, they returned to the marshes of the Jordan.
43 When Bacʹchides heard of this, he came with a large force on the sabbath day to the banks of the Jordan.
44 And Jonathan said to those with him, “Let us rise up now and fight for our lives, for today things are not as they were before.
45 For look! the battle is in front of us and behind us; the water of the Jordan is on this side and on that, with marsh and thicket; there is no place to turn.
46 Cry out now to Heaven that you may be delivered from the hands of our enemies.”
47 So the battle began, and Jonathan stretched out his hand to strike Bacʹchides, but he eluded him and went to the rear.
48 Then Jonathan and the men with him leaped into the Jordan and swam across to the other side, and the enemy did not cross the Jordan to attack them.
49 And about one thousand of Bacʹchides’ men fell that day.
### Bacchides Builds Fortifications
50 Bacʹchides then returned to Jerusalem and built strong cities in Judea: the fortress in Jericho, and Emmaʹus, and Beth-horʹon, and Bethel, and Timnath, and Pharʹathon, and Tephon, with high walls and gates and bars.
51 And he placed garrisons in them to harass Israel.
52 He also fortified the city of Beth-zur, and Gazarʹa, and the citadel, and in them he put troops and stores of food.
53 And he took the sons of the leading men of the land as hostages and put them under guard in the citadel at Jerusalem.
54 In the one hundred and fifty-third year, in the second month, Alʹcimus gave orders to tear down the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary. He tore down the work of the prophets!
55 But he only began to tear it down, for at that time Alʹcimus was stricken and his work was hindered; his mouth was stopped and he was paralyzed, so that he could no longer say a word or give commands concerning his house.
56 And Alʹcimus died at that time in great agony.
57 When Bacʹchides saw that Alʹcimus was dead, he returned to the king, and the land of Judah had rest for two years.
### The End of the War
58 Then all the lawless plotted and said, “See! Jonathan and his men are living in quiet and confidence. So now let us bring Bacʹchides back, and he will capture them all in one night.”
59 And they went and consulted with him.
60 He started to come with a large force, and secretly sent letters to all his allies in Judea, telling them to seize Jonathan and his men; but they were unable to do it, because their plan became known.
61 And Jonathan’s men seized about fifty of the men of the country who were leaders in this treachery, and killed them.
62 Then Jonathan with his men, and Simon, withdrew to Beth-baʹsi in the wilderness; he rebuilt the parts of it that had been demolished, and they fortified it.
63 When Bacʹchides learned of this, he assembled all his forces, and sent orders to the men of Judea.
64 Then he came and encamped against Beth-baʹsi; he fought against it for many days and made machines of war.
65 But Jonathan left Simon his brother in the city, while he went out into the country; and he went with only a few men.
66 He struck down Odomeʹra and his brothers and the sons of Phasiʹron in their tents.
67 Then he began to attack and went into battle with his forces; and Simon and his men sallied out from the city and set fire to the machines of war.
68 They fought with Bacʹchides, and he was crushed by them. They distressed him greatly, for his plan and his expedition had been in vain.
69 So he was greatly enraged at the lawless men who had counseled him to come into the country, and he killed many of them. Then he decided to depart to his own land.
70 When Jonathan learned of this, he sent ambassadors to him to make peace with him and obtain release of the captives.
71 He agreed, and did as he said; and he swore to Jonathan that he would not try to harm him as long as he lived.
72 He restored to him the captives whom he had formerly taken from the land of Judah; then he turned and departed to his own land, and came no more into their territory.
73 Thus the sword ceased from Israel. And Jonathan dwelt in Michmash. And Jonathan began to judge the people, and he destroyed the ungodly out of Israel.


# Liber Primus Machabaeorum 9 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Interea, ut audivit Demetrius quia cecidit Nicanor et exercitus ejus in prælio, apposuit Bacchidem et Alcimum rursum mittere in Judæam, et dextrum cornu cum illis.
2 Et abierunt viam quæ ducit in Galgala, et castra posuerunt in Masaloth, quæ est in Arbellis: et occupaverunt eam, et peremerunt animas hominum multas.
3 In mense primo anni centesimi et quinquagesimi secundi, applicuerunt exercitum ad Jerusalem:
4 et surrexerunt, et abierunt in Beream viginti millia virorum, et duo millia equitum.
5 Et Judas posuerat castra in Laisa, et tria millia viri electi cum eo:
6 et viderunt multitudinem exercitus, quia multi sunt, et timuerunt valde: et multi subtraxerunt se de castris, et non remanserunt ex eis nisi octingenti viri.
7 Et vidit Judas quod defluxit exercitus suus, et bellum perurgebat eum, et confractus est corde, quia non habebat tempus congregandi eos, et dissolutus est.
8 Et dixit his qui residui erant: Surgamus, et eamus ad adversarios nostros, si poterimus pugnare adversus eos.
9 Et avertebant eum, dicentes: Non poterimus, sed liberemus animas nostras modo, et revertamur ad fratres nostros, et tunc pugnabimus adversus eos: nos autem pauci sumus.
10 Et ait Judas: Absit istam rem facere ut fugiamus ab eis: et si appropiavit tempus nostrum, moriamur in virtute propter fratres nostros, et non inferamus crimen gloriæ nostræ.

11 Et movit exercitus de castris, et steterunt illis obviam: et divisi sunt equites in duas partes, et fundibularii et sagittarii præibant exercitum, et primi certaminis omnes potentes.
12 Bacchides autem erat in dextro cornu, et proximavit legio ex duabus partibus, et clamabant tubis:
13 exclamaverunt autem et hi qui erant ex parte Judæ etiam ipsi, et commota est terra a voce exercituum: et commissum est prælium a mane usque ad vesperam.
14 Et vidit Judas quod firmior est pars exercitus Bacchidis in dextris, et convenerunt cum ipso omnes constantes corde:
15 et contrita est dextera pars ab eis, et persecutus est eos usque ad montem Azoti.
16 Et qui in sinistro cornu erant, viderunt quod contritum est dextrum cornu, et secuti sunt post Judam, et eos qui cum ipso erant, a tergo:
17 et ingravatum est prælium, et ceciderunt vulnerati multi ex his et ex illis.
18 Et Judas cecidit, et ceteri fugerunt.

19 Et Jonathas et Simon tulerunt Judam fratrem suum, et sepelierunt eum in sepulchro patrum suorum in civitate Modin.
20 Et fleverunt eum omnis populus Israël planctu magno, et lugebant dies multos,
21 et dixerunt: Quomodo cecidit potens, qui salvum faciebat populum Israël!
22 Et cetera verba bellorum Judæ, et virtutum, quas fecit, et magnitudinis ejus, non sunt descripta: multa enim erant valde.

23 Et factum est: post obitum Judæ emerserunt iniqui in omnibus finibus Israël, et exorti sunt omnes qui operabantur iniquitatem.
24 In diebus illis facta est fames magna valde, et tradidit se Bacchidi omnis regio eorum cum ipsis.
25 Et elegit Bacchides viros impios, et constituit eos dominos regionis:
26 et exquirebant, et perscrutabantur amicos Judæ, et adducebant eos ad Bacchidem, et vindicabat in illos, et illudebat.
27 Et facta est tribulatio magna in Israël, qualis non fuit ex die qua non est visus propheta in Israël.
28 Et congregati sunt omnes amici Judæ, et dixerunt Jonathæ:
29 Ex quo frater tuus Judas defunctus est, vir similis ei non est, qui exeat contra inimicos nostros, Bacchidem et eos qui inimici sunt gentis nostræ.
30 Nunc itaque, te hodie elegimus esse pro eo nobis in principem, et ducem ad bellandum bellum nostrum.
31 Et suscepit Jonathas tempore illo principatum, et surrexit loco Judæ fratris sui.
32 Et cognovit Bacchides, et quærebat eum occidere.
33 Et cognovit Jonathas, et Simon frater ejus, et omnes qui cum eo erant: et fugerunt in desertum Thecuæ et consederunt ad aquam lacus Asphar.
34 Et cognovit Bacchides, et die sabbatorum venit ipse et omnis exercitus ejus trans Jordanem.

35 Et Jonathas misit fratrem suum ducem populi, et rogavit Nabuthæos amicos suos, ut commodarent illis apparatum suum, qui erat copiosus.
36 Et exierunt filii Jambri ex Madaba, et comprehenderunt Joannem et omnia quæ habebat, et abierunt habentes ea.
37 Post hæc verba, renuntiatum est Jonathæ et Simoni fratri ejus, quia filii Jambri faciunt nuptias magnas, et ducunt sponsam ex Madaba filiam unius de magnis principibus Chanaan cum ambitione magna.
38 Et recordati sunt sanguinis Joannis fratris sui: et ascenderunt, et absconderunt se sub tegumento montis.
39 Et elevaverunt oculos suos, et viderunt: et ecce tumultus, et apparatus multus: et sponsus processit, et amici ejus, et fratres ejus obviam illis cum tympanis, et musicis, et armis multis.
40 Et surrexerunt ad eos ex insidiis, et occiderunt eos, et ceciderunt vulnerati multi, et residui fugerunt in montes: et acceperunt omnia spolia eorum:
41 et conversæ sunt nuptiæ in luctum, et vox musicorum ipsorum in lamentum.
42 Et vindicaverunt vindictam sanguinis fratris sui: et reversi sunt ad ripam Jordanis.

43 Et audivit Bacchides, et venit die sabbatorum usque ad oram Jordanis in virtute magna.
44 Et dixit ad suos Jonathas: Surgamus, et pugnemus contra inimicos nostros: non est enim hodie sicut heri et nudiustertius:
45 ecce enim bellum ex adverso, aqua vero Jordanis hinc et inde, et ripæ, et paludes, et saltus: et non est locus divertendi.
46 Nunc ergo, clamate in cælum, ut liberemini de manu inimicorum vestrorum. Et commissum est bellum.
47 Et extendit Jonathas manum suam percutere Bacchidem, et divertit ab eo retro:
48 et desiliit Jonathas, et qui cum eo erant, in Jordanem, et transnataverunt ad eos Jordanem.
49 Et ceciderunt de parte Bacchidis die illa mille viri. Et reversi sunt in Jerusalem,

50 et ædificaverunt civitates munitas in Judæa, munitionem quæ erat in Jericho, et in Ammaum, et in Bethoron, et in Bethel, et Thamnata, et Phara, et Thopo muris excelsis, et portis, et seris.
51 Et posuit custodiam in eis, ut inimicitias exercerent in Israël:
52 et munivit civitatem Bethsuram, et Gazaram, et arcem, et posuit in eis auxilia, et apparatum escarum:
53 et accepit filios principum regionis obsides, et posuit eos in arce in Jerusalem in custodiam.
54 Et anno centesimo quinquagesimo tertio, mense secundo, præcepit Alcimus destrui muros domus sanctæ interioris, et destrui opera prophetarum: et cœpit destruere.
55 In tempore illo percussus est Alcimus: et impedita sunt opera illius, et occlusum est os ejus, et dissolutus est paralysi, nec ultra potuit loqui verbum, et mandare de domo sua.
56 Et mortuus est Alcimus in tempore illo cum tormento magno.

57 Et vidit Bacchides quoniam mortuus est Alcimus, et reversus est ad regem. Et siluit terra annis duobus.
58 Et cogitaverunt omnes iniqui, dicentes: Ecce Jonathas, et qui cum eo sunt, in silentio habitant confidenter: nunc ergo adducamus Bacchidem, et comprehendet eos omnes una nocte.
59 Et abierunt, et consilium ei dederunt.
60 Et surrexit ut veniret cum exercitu multo: et misit occulte epistolas sociis suis qui erant in Judæa, ut comprehenderent Jonathan, et eos qui cum eo erant: sed non potuerunt, quia innotuit eis consilium eorum.
61 Et apprehendit de viris regionis, qui principes erant malitiæ, quinquaginta viros, et occidit eos:
62 et secessit Jonathas, et Simon, et qui cum eo erant, in Bethbessen, quæ est in deserto: et exstruxit diruta ejus, et firmaverunt eam.

63 Et cognovit Bacchides, et congregavit universam multitudinem suam: et his, qui de Judæa erant, denuntiavit.
64 Et venit, et castra posuit desuper Bethbessen: et oppugnavit eam dies multos, et fecit machinas.
65 Et reliquit Jonathas Simonem fratrem suum in civitate, et exiit in regionem, et venit cum numero:
66 et percussit Odaren et fratres ejus, et filios Phaseron in tabernaculis ipsorum: et cœpit cædere, et crescere in virtutibus.
67 Simon vero, et qui cum ipso erant, exierunt de civitate, et succenderunt machinas,
68 et pugnaverunt contra Bacchidem, et contritus est ab eis: et afflixerunt eum valde, quoniam consilium ejus et congressus ejus erat inanis.
69 Et iratus contra viros iniquos, qui ei consilium dederant ut veniret in regionem ipsorum, multos ex eis occidit: ipse autem cogitavit cum reliquis abire in regionem suam.
70 Et cognovit Jonathas: et misit ad eum legatos componere pacem cum ipso, et reddere ei captivitatem.
71 Et libenter accepit, et fecit secundum verba ejus, et juravit se nihil facturum ei mali omnibus diebus vitæ ejus.
72 Et reddidit ei captivitatem, quam prius erat prædatus de terra Juda: et conversus abiit in terram suam, et non apposuit amplius venire in fines ejus.
73 Et cessavit gladius ex Israël: et habitavit Jonathas in Machmas, et cœpit Jonathas ibi judicare populum, et exterminavit impios ex Israël.

44 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωναθαν τοῖς πα{R'} αὐτοῦ ἀναστῶμεν δὴ καὶ πολεμήσωμεν περὶ τῶν ψυχῶν ἡμῶν οὐ γάρ ἐστιν σήμερον ὡς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν
45 ἰδοὺ γὰρ ὁ πόλεμος ἐξ ἐναντίας καὶ ἐξόπισθεν ἡμῶν τὸ δὲ ὕδωρ τοῦ Ιορδάνου ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν καὶ ἕλος καὶ δρυμός οὐκ ἔστιν τόπος τοῦ ἐκκλῖναι
46 νῦν οὖν κεκράξατε εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν ὅπως διασωθῆτε ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν
47 καὶ συνῆψεν ὁ πόλεμος καὶ ἐξέτεινεν Ιωναθαν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ πατάξαι τὸν Βακχίδην καὶ ἐξέκλινεν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω
48 καὶ ἐνεπήδησεν Ιωναθαν καὶ οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν Ιορδάνην καὶ διεκολύμβησαν εἰς τὸ πέραν καὶ οὐ διέβησαν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς τὸν Ιορδάνην
49 ἔπεσον δὲ παρὰ Βακχίδου τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἰς χιλίους ἄνδρας

50 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν πόλεις ὀχυρὰς ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ τὸ ὀχύρωμα τὸ ἐν Ιεριχω καὶ τὴν Αμμαους καὶ τὴν Βαιθωρων καὶ τὴν Βαιθηλ καὶ τὴν Θαμναθα Φαραθων καὶ τὴν Τεφων ἐν τείχεσιν ὑψηλοῖς καὶ πύλαις καὶ μοχλοῖς
51 καὶ ἔθετο φρουρὰν ἐν αὐτοῖς τοῦ ἐχθραίνειν τῷ Ισραηλ
52 καὶ ὠχύρωσεν τὴν πόλιν τὴν Βαιθσουραν καὶ Γαζαρα καὶ τὴν ἄκραν καὶ ἔθετο ἐν αὐταῖς δυνάμεις καὶ παραθέσεις βρωμάτων
53 καὶ ἔλαβεν τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν ἡγουμένων τῆς χώρας ὅμηρα καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἄκρᾳ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἐν φυλακῇ
54 καὶ ἐν ἔτει τρίτῳ καὶ πεντηκοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἐπέταξεν Ἄλκιμος καθαιρεῖν τὸ τεῖχος τῆς αὐλῆς τῶν ἁγίων τῆς ἐσωτέρας καὶ καθεῖλεν τὰ ἔργα τῶν προφητῶν καὶ ἐνήρξατο τοῦ καθαιρεῖν
55 ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἐπλήγη Ἄλκιμος καὶ ἐνεποδίσθη τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπεφράγη τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ καὶ παρελύθη καὶ οὐκ ἠδύνατο ἔτι λαλῆσαι λόγον καὶ ἐντείλασθαι περὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ
56 καὶ ἀπέθανεν Ἄλκιμος ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ μετὰ βασάνου μεγάλης

57 καὶ εἶδεν Βακχίδης ὅτι ἀπέθανεν Ἄλκιμος καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ Ιουδα ἔτη δύο
58 καὶ ἐβουλεύσαντο πάντες οἱ ἄνομοι λέγοντες ἰδοὺ Ιωναθαν καὶ οἱ πα{R'} αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ κατοικοῦσιν πεποιθότες νῦν οὖν ἀνάξομεν τὸν Βακχίδην καὶ συλλήμψεται αὐτοὺς πάντας ἐν νυκτὶ μιᾷ
59 καὶ πορευθέντες συνεβουλεύσαντο αὐτῷ
60 καὶ ἀπῆρεν τοῦ ἐλθεῖν μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς καὶ ἀπέστειλεν λάθρᾳ ἐπιστολὰς πᾶσιν τοῖς συμμάχοις αὐτοῦ τοῖς ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ ὅπως συλλάβωσιν τὸν Ιωναθαν καὶ τοὺς με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο ὅτι ἐγνώσθη ἡ βουλὴ αὐτῶν
61 καὶ συνέλαβον ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῆς χώρας τῶν ἀρχηγῶν τῆς κακίας εἰς πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτούς
62 καὶ ἐξεχώρησεν Ιωναθαν καὶ Σιμων καὶ οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἰς Βαιθβασι τὴν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν τὰ καθῃρημένα αὐτῆς καὶ ἐστερέωσαν αὐτήν

63 καὶ ἔγνω Βακχίδης καὶ συνήγαγεν πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῖς ἐκ τῆς Ιουδαίας παρήγγειλεν
64 καὶ ἐλθὼν παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ Βαιθβασι καὶ ἐπολέμησεν αὐτὴν ἡμέρας πολλὰς καὶ ἐποίησεν μηχανάς
65 καὶ ἀπέλιπεν Ιωναθαν Σιμωνα τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς τὴν χώραν καὶ ἦλθεν ἐν ἀριθμῷ
66 καὶ ἐπάταξεν Οδομηρα καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Φασιρων ἐν τῷ σκηνώματι αὐτῶν καὶ ἤρξαντο τύπτειν καὶ ἀνέβαινον ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσιν
67 καὶ Σιμων καὶ οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν τὰς μηχανάς
68 καὶ ἐπολέμησαν πρὸς τὸν Βακχίδην καὶ συνετρίβη ὑ{P'} αὐτῶν καὶ ἔθλιβον αὐτὸν σφόδρα ὅτι ἦν ἡ βουλὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ ἔφοδος αὐτοῦ κενή
69 καὶ ὠργίσθη ἐν θυμῷ τοῖς ἀνδράσιν τοῖς ἀνόμοις τοῖς συμβουλεύσασιν αὐτῷ ἐλθεῖν εἰς τὴν χώραν καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν ἐξ αὐτῶν πολλοὺς καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ
70 καὶ ἐπέγνω Ιωναθαν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς αὐτὸν πρέσβεις τοῦ συνθέσθαι πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰρήνην καὶ ἀποδοῦναι αὐτοῖς τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν
71 καὶ ἐπεδέξατο καὶ ἐποίησεν κατὰ τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ μὴ ἐκζητῆσαι αὐτῷ κακὸν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ
72 καὶ ἀπέδωκεν αὐτῷ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν ἣν ᾐχμαλώτευσεν τὸ πρότερον ἐκ γῆς Ιουδα καὶ ἀποστρέψας ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐ προσέθετο ἔτι ἐλθεῖν εἰς τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν
73 καὶ κατέπαυσεν ῥομφαία ἐξ Ισραηλ καὶ ᾤκησεν Ιωναθαν ἐν Μαχμας καὶ ἤρξατο Ιωναθαν κρίνειν τὸν λαὸν καὶ ἠφάνισεν τοὺς ἀσεβεῖς ἐξ Ισραηλ
