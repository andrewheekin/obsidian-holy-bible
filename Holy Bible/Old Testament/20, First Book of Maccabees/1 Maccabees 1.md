# First Book of Maccabees 1 (RSVCE)

### Alexander the Great
1 After Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came from the land of Kittim, had defeated Dariʹus, king of the Persians and the Medes, he succeeded him as king. (He had previously become king of Greece.)
2 He fought many battles, conquered strongholds, and put to death the kings of the earth.
3 He advanced to the ends of the earth, and plundered many nations. When the earth became quiet before him, he was exalted, and his heart was lifted up.
4 He gathered a very strong army and ruled over countries, nations, and princes, and they became tributary to him.
5 After this he fell sick and perceived that he was dying.
6 So he summoned his most honored officers, who had been brought up with him from youth, and divided his kingdom among them while he was still alive.
7 And after Alexander had reigned twelve years, he died.
8 Then his officers began to rule, each in his own place.
9 They all put on crowns after his death, and so did their sons after them for many years; and they caused many evils on the earth.
### Antiochus Epiphanes and Renegade Jews
10 From them came forth a sinful root, Antiʹochus Epiphʹanes, son of Antiʹochus the king; he had been a hostage in Rome. He began to reign in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.
11 In those days lawless men came forth from Israel, and misled many, saying, “Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles round about us, for since we separated from them many evils have come upon us.”
12 This proposal pleased them,
13 and some of the people eagerly went to the king. He authorized them to observe the ordinances of the Gentiles.
14 So they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, according to Gentile custom,
15 and removed the marks of circumcision, and abandoned the holy covenant. They joined with the Gentiles and sold themselves to do evil.
### Antiochus in Egypt
16 When Antiʹochus saw that his kingdom was established, he determined to become king of the land of Egypt, that he might reign over both kingdoms.
17 So he invaded Egypt with a strong force, with chariots and elephants and cavalry and with a large fleet.
18 He engaged Ptolʹemy king of Egypt in battle, and Ptolʹemy turned and fled before him, and many were wounded and fell.
19 And they captured the fortified cities in the land of Egypt, and he plundered the land of Egypt.
### Persecution of the Jews
20 After subduing Egypt, Antiʹochus returned in the one hundred and forty-third year. He went up against Israel and came to Jerusalem with a strong force.
21 He arrogantly entered the sanctuary and took the golden altar, the lampstand for the light, and all its utensils.
22 He took also the table for the bread of the Presence, the cups for drink offerings, the bowls, the golden censers, the curtain, the crowns, and the gold decoration on the front of the temple; he stripped it all off.
23 He took the silver and the gold, and the costly vessels; he took also the hidden treasures which he found.
24 Taking them all, he departed to his own land. He committed deeds of murder, and spoke with great arrogance.
25 Israel mourned deeply in every community,
26 rulers and elders groaned, maidens and young men became faint, the beauty of the women faded.
27 Every bridegroom took up the lament; she who sat in the bridal chamber was mourning.
28 Even the land shook for its inhabitants, and all the house of Jacob was clothed with shame.
### The Occupation of Jerusalem
29 Two years later the king sent to the cities of Judah a chief collector of tribute, and he came to Jerusalem with a large force.
30 Deceitfully he spoke peaceable words to them, and they believed him; but he suddenly fell upon the city, dealt it a severe blow, and destroyed many people of Israel.
31 He plundered the city, burned it with fire, and tore down its houses and its surrounding walls.
32 And they took captive the women and children, and seized the cattle.
33 Then they fortified the city of David with a great strong wall and strong towers, and it became their citadel.
34 And they stationed there a sinful people, lawless men. These strengthened their position;
35 they stored up arms and food, and collecting the spoils of Jerusalem they stored them there, and became a great snare.
36 It became an ambush against the sanctuary, an evil adversary of Israel continually.
37 On every side of the sanctuary they shed innocent blood; they even defiled the sanctuary.
38 Because of them the residents of Jerusalem fled; she became a dwelling of strangers; she became strange to her offspring, and her children forsook her.
39 Her sanctuary became desolate as a desert; her feasts were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into a reproach, her honor into contempt.
40 Her dishonor now grew as great as her glory; her exaltation was turned into mourning.
### Installation of Gentile Cults
41 Then the king wrote to his whole kingdom that all should be one people,
42 and that each should give up his customs.
43 All the Gentiles accepted the command of the king. Many even from Israel gladly adopted his religion; they sacrificed to idols and profaned the sabbath.
44 And the king sent letters by messengers to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah; he directed them to follow customs strange to the land,
45 to forbid burnt offerings and sacrifices and drink offerings in the sanctuary, to profane sabbaths and feasts,
46 to defile the sanctuary and the priests,
47 to build altars and sacred precincts and shrines for idols, to sacrifice swine and unclean animals,
48 and to leave their sons uncircumcised. They were to make themselves abominable by everything unclean and profane,
49 so that they should forget the law and change all the ordinances.
50 “And whoever does not obey the command of the king shall die.”
51 In such words he wrote to his whole kingdom. And he appointed inspectors over all the people and commanded the cities of Judah to offer sacrifice, city by city.
52 Many of the people, every one who forsook the law, joined them, and they did evil in the land;
53 they drove Israel into hiding in every place of refuge they had.
54 Now on the fifteenth day of Chislev, in the one hundred and forty-fifth year, they erected a desolating sacrilege upon the altar of burnt offering. They also built altars in the surrounding cities of Judah,
55 and burned incense at the doors of the houses and in the streets.
56 The books of the law which they found they tore to pieces and burned with fire.
57 Where the book of the covenant was found in the possession of any one, or if any one adhered to the law, the decree of the king condemned him to death.
58 They kept using violence against Israel, against those found month after month in the cities.
59 And on the twenty-fifth day of the month they offered sacrifice on the altar which was upon the altar of burnt offering.
60 According to the decree, they put to death the women who had their children circumcised,
61 and their families and those who circumcised them; and they hung the infants from their mothers’ necks.
62 But many in Israel stood firm and were resolved in their hearts not to eat unclean food.
63 They chose to die rather than to be defiled by food or to profane the holy covenant; and they did die.
64 And very great wrath came upon Israel.


# Liber Primus Machabaeorum 1 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et factum est, postquam percussit Alexander Philippi Macedo, qui primus regnavit in Græcia, egressus de terra Cethim, Darium regem Persarum et Medorum:
2 constituit prælia multa, et obtinuit omnium munitiones, et interfecit reges terræ,
3 et pertransiit usque ad fines terræ: et accepit spolia multitudinis gentium, et siluit terra in conspectu ejus.
4 Et congregavit virtutem, et exercitum fortem nimis: et exaltatum est, et elevatum cor ejus:
5 et obtinuit regiones gentium, et tyrannos: et facti sunt illi in tributum.
6 Et post hæc decidit in lectum, et cognovit quia moreretur.
7 Et vocavit pueros suos nobiles, qui secum erant nutriti a juventute: et divisit illis regnum suum, cum adhuc viveret.
8 Et regnavit Alexander annis duodecim, et mortuus est.

9 Et obtinuerunt pueri ejus regnum, unusquisque in loco suo:
10 et imposuerunt omnes sibi diademata post mortem ejus, et filii eorum post eos annis multis, et multiplicata sunt mala in terra.
11 Et exiit ex eis radix peccatrix, Antiochus illustris, filius Antiochi regis, qui fuerat Romæ obses: et regnavit in anno centesimo trigesimo septimo regni Græcorum.
12 In diebus illis, exierunt ex Israël filii iniqui, et suaserunt multis, dicentes: Eamus, et disponamus testamentum cum gentibus, quæ circa nos sunt: quia ex quo recessimus ab eis, invenerunt nos multa mala.
13 Et bonus visus est sermo in oculis eorum.
14 Et destinaverunt aliqui de populo, et abierunt ad regem: et dedit illis potestatem ut facerent justitiam gentium.
15 Et ædificaverunt gymnasium in Jerosolymis secundum leges nationum:
16 et fecerunt sibi præputia, et recesserunt a testamento sancto, et juncti sunt nationibus, et venundati sunt ut facerent malum.

17 Et paratum est regnum in conspectu Antiochi, et cœpit regnare in terra Ægypti ut regnaret super duo regna.
18 Et intravit in Ægyptum in multitudine gravi, in curribus, et elephantis, et equitibus, et copiosa navium multitudine:
19 et constituit bellum adversus Ptolemæum regem Ægypti, et veritus est Ptolemæus a facie ejus, et fugit, et ceciderunt vulnerati multi.
20 Et comprehendit civitates munitas in terra Ægypti, et accepit spolia terræ Ægypti.
21 Et convertit Antiochus, postquam percussit Ægyptum in centesimo et quadragesimo tertio anno: et ascendit ad Israël,
22 et ascendit Jerosolymam in multitudine gravi.
23 Et intravit in sanctificationem cum superbia, et accepit altare aureum, et candelabrum luminis, et universa vasa ejus, et mensam propositionis, et libatoria, et phialas, et mortariola aurea, et velum, et coronas, et ornamentum aureum, quod in facie templi erat: et comminuit omnia.
24 Et accepit argentum, et aurum, et vasa concupiscibilia: et accepit thesauros occultos, quos invenit: et sublatis omnibus, abiit in terram suam.
25 Et fecit cædem hominum, et locutus est in superbia magna.

26 Et factus est planctus magnus in Israël, et in omni loco eorum:
27 et ingemuerunt principes et seniores; virgines et juvenes infirmati sunt: et speciositas mulierum immutata est.
28 Omnis maritus sumpsit lamentum, et quæ sedebant in thoro maritali, lugebant:
29 et commota est terra super habitantes in ea, et universa domus Jacob induit confusionem.

30 Et post duos annos dierum, misit rex principem tributorum in civitates Juda, et venit Jerusalem cum turba magna.
31 Et locutus est ad eos verba pacifica in dolo: et crediderunt ei.
32 Et irruit super civitatem repente, et percussit eam plaga magna, et perdidit populum multum ex Israël.
33 Et accepit spolia civitatis: et succendit eam igni, et destruxit domos ejus, et muros ejus in circuitu:
34 et captivas duxerunt mulieres, et natos et pecora possederunt.
35 Et ædificaverunt civitatem David muro magno et firmo, et turribus firmis, et facta est illis in arcem:
36 et posuerunt illic gentem peccatricem viros iniquos, et convaluerunt in ea: et posuerunt arma, et escas, et congregaverunt spolia Jerusalem:
37 et reposuerunt illic: et facti sunt in laqueum magnum.
38 Et factum est hoc ad insidias sanctificationi, et in diabolum malum in Israël:
39 et effuderunt sanguinem innocentem per circuitum sanctificationis, et contaminaverunt sanctificationem.
40 Et fugerunt habitatores Jerusalem propter eos, et facta est habitatio exterorum, et facta est extera semini suo, et nati ejus reliquerunt eam.
41 Sanctificatio ejus desolata est sicut solitudo; dies festi ejus conversi sunt in luctum, sabbata ejus in opprobrium, honores ejus in nihilum.
42 Secundum gloriam ejus multiplicata est ignominia ejus, et sublimitas ejus conversa est in luctum.

43 Et scripsit rex Antiochus omni regno suo ut esset omnis populus unus: et relinqueret unusquisque legem suam.
44 Et consenserunt omnes gentes secundum verbum regis Antiochi:
45 et multi ex Israël consenserunt servituti ejus, et sacrificaverunt idolis, et coinquinaverunt sabbatum.
46 Et misit rex libros per manus nuntiorum in Jerusalem, et in omnes civitates Juda, ut sequerentur leges gentium terræ,
47 et prohiberent holocausta et sacrificia, et placationes fieri in templo Dei,
48 et prohiberent celebrari sabbatum, et dies solemnes:
49 et jussit coinquinari sancta, et sanctum populum Israël.
50 Et jussit ædificari aras, et templa, et idola, et immolari carnes suillas, et pecora communia,
51 et relinquere filios suos incircumcisos, et coinquinari animas eorum in omnibus immundis, et abominationibus, ita ut obliviscerentur legem, et immutarent omnes justificationes Dei:
52 et quicumque non fecissent secundum verbum regis Antiochi, morerentur.

53 Secundum omnia verba hæc scripsit omni regno suo: et præposuit principes populo, qui hæc fieri cogerent.
54 Et jusserunt civitatibus Juda sacrificare.
55 Et congregati sunt multi de populo ad eos qui dereliquerant legem Domini, et fecerunt mala super terram:
56 et effugaverunt populum Israël in abditis, et in absconditis fugitivorum locis.
57 Die quintadecima mensis Casleu, quinto et quadragesimo et centesimo anno, ædificavit rex Antiochus abominandum idolum desolationis super altare Dei, et per universas civitates Juda in circuitu ædificaverunt aras:
58 et ante januas domorum et in plateis incendebant thura, et sacrificabant:
59 et libros legis Dei combusserunt igni, scindentes eos:
60 et apud quemcumque inveniebantur libri testamenti Domini, et quicumque observabat legem Domini, secundum edictum regis trucidabant eum.
61 In virtute sua faciebant hæc populo Israël, qui inveniebatur in omni mense et mense in civitatibus.
62 Et quinta et vigesima die mensis sacrificabant super aram, quæ erat contra altare.
63 Et mulieres, quæ circumcidebant filios suos, trucidabantur secundum jussum regis Antiochi,
64 et suspendebant pueros a cervicibus per universas domos eorum: et eos, qui circumciderant illos, trucidabant.
65 Et multi de populo Israël definierunt apud se, ut non manducarent immunda: et elegerunt magis mori, quam cibis coinquinari immundis:
66 et noluerunt infringere legem Dei sanctam, et trucidati sunt:
67 et facta est ira magna super populum valde.

1 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ πατάξαι Ἀλέξανδρον τὸν Φιλίππου Μακεδόνα ὃς ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ γῆς Χεττιιμ καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὸν Δαρεῖον βασιλέα Περσῶν καὶ Μήδων καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ πρότερον ἐπὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα

9 καὶ ἐπεκράτησαν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ τόπῳ αὐτοῦ
10 καὶ ἐπέθεντο πάντες διαδήματα μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτὸν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἔτη πολλὰ καὶ ἐπλήθυναν κακὰ ἐν τῇ γῇ
11 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ αὐτῶν ῥίζα ἁμαρτωλὸς Ἀντίοχος Ἐπιφανὴς υἱὸς Ἀντιόχου τοῦ βασιλέως ὃς ἦν ὅμηρα ἐν Ῥώμῃ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν ἔτει ἑκατοστῷ καὶ τριακοστῷ καὶ ἑβδόμῳ βασιλείας Ἑλλήνων
12 ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἐξῆλθον ἐξ Ισραηλ υἱοὶ παράνομοι καὶ ἀνέπεισαν πολλοὺς λέγοντες πορευθῶμεν καὶ διαθώμεθα διαθήκην μετὰ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν κύκλῳ ἡμῶν ὅτι ἀ{F'} ἧς ἐχωρίσθημεν ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν εὗρεν ἡμᾶς κακὰ πολλά
13 καὶ ἠγαθύνθη ὁ λόγος ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν
14 καὶ προεθυμήθησάν τινες ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἐξουσίαν ποιῆσαι τὰ δικαιώματα τῶν ἐθνῶν
15 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν γυμνάσιον ἐν Ιεροσολύμοις κατὰ τὰ νόμιμα τῶν ἐθνῶν
16 καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς ἀκροβυστίας καὶ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ διαθήκης ἁγίας καὶ ἐζευγίσθησαν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν καὶ ἐπράθησαν τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρόν

17 καὶ ἡτοιμάσθη ἡ βασιλεία ἐνώπιον Ἀντιόχου καὶ ὑπέλαβεν βασιλεῦσαι γῆς Αἰγύπτου ὅπως βασιλεύσῃ ἐπὶ τὰς δύο βασιλείας
18 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἐν ὄχλῳ βαρεῖ ἐν ἅρμασιν καὶ ἐλέφασιν καὶ ἐν ἱππεῦσιν καὶ ἐν στόλῳ μεγάλῳ
19 καὶ συνεστήσατο πόλεμον πρὸς Πτολεμαῖον βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐνετράπη Πτολεμαῖος ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφυγεν καὶ ἔπεσον τραυματίαι πολλοί
20 καὶ κατελάβοντο τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὀχυρὰς ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰ σκῦλα γῆς Αἰγύπτου
21 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἀντίοχος μετὰ τὸ πατάξαι Αἴγυπτον ἐν τῷ ἑκατοστῷ καὶ τεσσαρακοστῷ καὶ τρίτῳ ἔτει καὶ ἀνέβη ἐπὶ Ισραηλ
22 καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς Ιεροσόλυμα ἐν ὄχλῳ βαρεῖ
23 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ ἁγίασμα ἐν ὑπερηφανίᾳ καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χρυσοῦν καὶ τὴν λυχνίαν τοῦ φωτὸς καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς καὶ τὴν τράπεζαν τῆς προθέσεως καὶ τὰ σπονδεῖα καὶ τὰς φιάλας καὶ τὰς θυΐσκας τὰς χρυσᾶς καὶ τὸ καταπέτασμα καὶ τοὺς στεφάνους καὶ τὸν κόσμον τὸν χρυσοῦν τὸν κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ναοῦ καὶ ἐλέπισεν πάντα
24 καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἐπιθυμητὰ καὶ ἔλαβεν τοὺς θησαυροὺς τοὺς ἀποκρύφους οὓς εὗρεν
25 καὶ λαβὼν πάντα ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐποίησεν φονοκτονίαν καὶ ἐλάλησεν ὑπερηφανίαν μεγάλην

26 καὶ ἐγένετο πένθος μέγα ἐπὶ Ισραηλ ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ αὐτῶν
27 καὶ ἐστέναξαν ἄρχοντες καὶ πρεσβύτεροι παρθένοι καὶ νεανίσκοι ἠσθένησαν καὶ τὸ κάλλος τῶν γυναικῶν ἠλλοιώθη
28 πᾶς νυμφίος ἀνέλαβεν θρῆνον καὶ καθημένη ἐν παστῷ ἐπένθει
29 καὶ ἐσείσθη ἡ γῆ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας αὐτήν καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος Ιακωβ ἐνεδύσατο αἰσχύνην

30 μετὰ δύο ἔτη ἡμερῶν ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἄρχοντα φορολογίας εἰς τὰς πόλεις Ιουδα καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ ἐν ὄχλῳ βαρεῖ
31 καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς λόγους εἰρηνικοὺς ἐν δόλῳ καὶ ἐνεπίστευσαν αὐτῷ

52 καὶ ὃς ἂν μὴ ποιήσῃ κατὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ βασιλέως ἀποθανεῖται

53 κατὰ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἔγραψεν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐπισκόπους ἐπὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν
54 καὶ ἐνετείλατο ταῖς πόλεσιν Ιουδα θυσιάζειν κατὰ πόλιν καὶ πόλιν
55 καὶ συνηθροίσθησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ πολλοὶ πρὸς αὐτούς πᾶς ὁ ἐγκαταλείπων τὸν νόμον καὶ ἐποίησαν κακὰ ἐν τῇ γῇ
56 καὶ ἔθεντο τὸν Ισραηλ ἐν κρύφοις ἐν παντὶ φυγαδευτηρίῳ αὐτῶν
57 καὶ τῇ πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ Χασελευ τῷ πέμπτῳ καὶ τεσσαρακοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ ἔτει ᾠκοδόμησεν βδέλυγμα ἐρημώσεως ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον καὶ ἐν πόλεσιν Ιουδα κύκλῳ ᾠκοδόμησαν βωμούς
58 καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν θυρῶν τῶν οἰκιῶν καὶ ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις ἐθυμίων
59 καὶ τὰ βιβλία τοῦ νόμου ἃ εὗρον ἐνεπύρισαν ἐν πυρὶ κατασχίσαντες
60 καὶ ὅπου εὑρίσκετο παρά τινι βιβλίον διαθήκης καὶ εἴ τις συνευδόκει τῷ νόμῳ τὸ σύγκριμα τοῦ βασιλέως ἐθανάτου αὐτόν
61 ἐν ἰσχύι αὐτῶν ἐποίουν τῷ Ισραηλ τοῖς εὑρισκομένοις ἐν παντὶ μηνὶ καὶ μηνὶ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν
62 καὶ τῇ πέμπτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνὸς θυσιάζοντες ἐπὶ τὸν βωμόν ὃς ἦν ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου
63 καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας τὰς περιτετμηκυίας τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν ἐθανάτωσαν κατὰ τὸ πρόσταγμα
64 καὶ ἐκρέμασαν τὰ βρέφη ἐκ τῶν τραχήλων αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς περιτετμηκότας αὐτούς
65 καὶ πολλοὶ ἐν Ισραηλ ἐκραταιώθησαν καὶ ὠχυρώθησαν ἐν αὑτοῖς τοῦ μὴ φαγεῖν κοινὰ
66 καὶ ἐπεδέξαντο ἀποθανεῖν ἵνα μὴ μιανθῶσιν τοῖς βρώμασιν καὶ μὴ βεβηλώσωσιν διαθήκην ἁγίαν καὶ ἀπέθανον
67 καὶ ἐγένετο ὀργὴ μεγάλη ἐπὶ Ισραηλ σφόδρα
