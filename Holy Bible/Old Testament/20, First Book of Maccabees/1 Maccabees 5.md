# First Book of Maccabees 5 (RSVCE)

### Wars with Neighboring Peoples
1 When the Gentiles round about heard that the altar had been built and the sanctuary dedicated as it was before, they became very angry,
2 and they determined to destroy the descendants of Jacob who lived among them. So they began to kill and destroy among the people.
3 But Judas made war on the sons of Esau in Idumeʹa, at Akrabatteʹne, because they kept lying in wait for Israel. He dealt them a heavy blow and humbled them and despoiled them.
4 He also remembered the wickedness of the sons of Baean, who were a trap and a snare to the people and ambushed them on the highways.
5 They were shut up by him in their towers; and he encamped against them, vowed their complete destruction, and burned with fire their towers and all who were in them.
6 Then he crossed over to attack the Amʹmonites, where he found a strong band and many people with Timothy as their leader.
7 He engaged in many battles with them and they were crushed before him; he struck them down.
8 He also took Jazer and its villages; then he returned to Judea.
### Liberation of Galilean Jews
9 Now the Gentiles in Gilʹead gathered together against the Israelites who lived in their territory, and planned to destroy them. But they fled to the stronghold of Dathʹema,
10 and sent to Judas and his brothers a letter which said, “The Gentiles around us have gathered together against us to destroy us.
11 They are preparing to come and capture the stronghold to which we have fled, and Timothy is leading their forces.
12 Now then come and rescue us from their hands, for many of us have fallen,
13 and all our brethren who were in the land of Tob have been killed; the enemy have captured their wives and children and goods, and have destroyed about a thousand men there.”
14 While the letter was still being read, behold, other messengers, with their garments rent, came from Galilee and made a similar report;
15 they said that against them had gathered together men of Ptolemaʹis and Tyre and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, “to annihilate us.”
16 When Judas and the people heard these messages, a great assembly was called to determine what they should do for their brethren who were in distress and were being attacked by enemies.
17 Then Judas said to Simon his brother, “Choose your men and go and rescue your brethren in Galilee; I and Jonathan my brother will go to Gilʹead.”
18 But he left Joseph, the son of Zechariʹah, and Azariʹah, a leader of the people, with the rest of the forces, in Judea to guard it;
19 and he gave them this command, “Take charge of this people, but do not engage in battle with the Gentiles until we return.”
20 Then three thousand men were assigned to Simon to go to Galilee, and eight thousand to Judas for Gilʹead.
21 so Simon went to Galilee and fought many battles against the Gentiles, and the Gentiles were crushed before him.
22 He pursued them to the gate of Ptolemaʹis, and as many as three thousand of the Gentiles fell, and he despoiled them.
23 Then he took the Jews of Galilee and Arbatʹta, with their wives and children, and all they possessed, and led them to Judea with great rejoicing.
### Judas and Jonathan in Gilead
24 Judas Maccabeʹus and Jonathan his brother crossed the Jordan and went three days’ journey into the wilderness.
25 They encountered the Nabateʹans, who met them peaceably and told them all that had happened to their brethren in Gilʹead:
26 “Many of them have been shut up in Bozrah and Bosor, in Alʹema and Chaspho, Maked and Carʹnaim”—all these cities were strong and large—
27 “and some have been shut up in the other cities of Gilʹead; the enemy are getting ready to attack the strongholds tomorrow and take and destroy all these men in one day.”
28 Then Judas and his army quickly turned back by the wilderness road to Bozrah; and he took the city, and killed every male by the edge of the sword; then he seized all its spoils and burned it with fire.
29 He departed from there at night, and they went all the way to the stronghold of Dathʹema.
30 At dawn they looked up, and behold, a large company, that could not be counted, carrying ladders and engines of war to capture the stronghold, and attacking the Jews within.
31 So Judas saw that the battle had begun and that the cry of the city went up to Heaven with trumpets and loud shouts,
32 and he said to the men of his forces, “Fight today for your brethren!”
33 Then he came up behind them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets and cried aloud in prayer.
34 And when the army of Timothy realized that it was Maccabeʹus, they fled before him, and he dealt them a heavy blow. As many as eight thousand of them fell that day.
35 Next he turned aside to Alʹema, and fought against it and took it; and he killed every male in it, plundered it, and burned it with fire.
36 From there he marched on and took Chaspho, Maked, and Bosor, and the other cities of Gilʹead.
37 After these things Timothy gathered another army and encamped opposite Raphon, on the other side of the stream.
38 Judas sent men to spy out the camp, and they reported to him, “All the Gentiles around us have gathered to him; it is a very large force.
39 They also have hired Arabs to help them, and they are encamped across the stream, ready to come and fight against you.” And Judas went to meet them.
40 Now as Judas and his army drew near to the stream of water, Timothy said to the officers of his forces, “If he crosses over to us first, we will not be able to resist him, for he will surely defeat us.
41 But if he shows fear and camps on the other side of the river, we will cross over to him and defeat him.”
42 When Judas approached the stream of water, he stationed the scribes of the people at the stream and gave them this command, “Permit no man to encamp, but make them all enter the battle.”
43 Then he crossed over against them first, and the whole army followed him. All the Gentiles were defeated before him, and they threw away their arms and fled into the sacred precincts at Carʹnaim.
44 But he took the city and burned the sacred precincts with fire, together with all who were in them. Thus Carʹnaim was conquered; they could stand before Judas no longer.
### The Return to Jerusalem
45 Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites in Gilʹead, the small and the great, with their wives and children and goods, a very large company, to go to the land of Judah.
46 So they came to Ephron. This was a large and very strong city on the road, and they could not go round it to the right or to the left; they had to go through it.
47 But the men of the city shut them out and blocked up the gates with stones.
48 And Judas sent them this friendly message, “Let us pass through your land to get to our land. No one will do you harm; we will simply pass by on foot.” But they refused to open to him.
49 Then Judas ordered proclamation to be made to the army that each should encamp where he was.
50 So the men of the forces encamped, and he fought against the city all that day and all the night, and the city was delivered into his hands.
51 He destroyed every male by the edge of the sword, and razed and plundered the city. Then he passed through the city over the slain.
52 And they crossed the Jordan into the large plain before Beth-shan.
53 And Judas kept rallying the laggards and encouraging the people all the way till he came to the land of Judah.
54 So they went up to Mount Zion with gladness and joy, and offered burnt offerings, because not one of them had fallen before they returned in safety.
### Joseph and Azariah Defeated
55 Now while Judas and Jonathan were in Gilʹead and Simon his brother was in Galilee before Ptolemaʹis,
56 Joseph, the son of Zechariʹah, and Azariʹah, the commanders of the forces, heard of their brave deeds and of the heroic war they had fought.
57 So they said, “Let us also make a name for ourselves; let us go and make war on the Gentiles around us.”
58 And they issued orders to the men of the forces that were with them, and they marched against Jamʹnia.
59 And Gorʹgias and his men came out of the city to meet them in battle.
60 Then Joseph and Azariʹah were routed, and were pursued to the borders of Judea; as many as two thousand of the people of Israel fell that day.
61 Thus the people suffered a great rout because, thinking to do a brave deed, they did not listen to Judas and his brothers.
62 But they did not belong to the family of those men through whom deliverance was given to Israel.
63 The man Judas and his brothers were greatly honored in all Israel and among all the Gentiles, wherever their name was heard.
64 Men gathered to them and praised them.
### Success at Hebron and Philistia
65 Then Judas and his brothers went forth and fought the sons of Esau in the land to the south. He struck Hebron and its villages and tore down its strongholds and burned its towers round about.
66 Then he marched off to go into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Marʹisa.
67 On that day some priests, who wished to do a brave deed, fell in battle, for they went out to battle unwisely.
68 But Judas turned aside to Azoʹtus in the land of the Philistines; he tore down their altars, and the graven images of their gods he burned with fire; he plundered the cities and returned to the land of Judah.


# Liber Primus Machabaeorum 5 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et factum est, ut audierunt gentes in circuitu quia ædificatum est altare et sanctuarium sicut prius, iratæ sunt valde:
2 et cogitabant tollere genus Jacob, qui erant inter eos, et cœperunt occidere de populo, et persequi.
3 Et debellabat Judas filios Esau in Idumæa, et eos qui erant in Acrabathane, quia circumsedebant Israëlitas: et percussit eos plaga magna.
4 Et recordatus est malitiam filiorum Bean, qui erant populo in laqueum et in scandalum, insidiantes ei in via.
5 Et conclusi sunt ab eo in turribus, et applicuit ad eos, et anathematizavit eos, et incendit turres eorum igni cum omnibus qui in eis erant.
6 Et transivit ad filios Ammon, et invenit manum fortem, et populum copiosum, et Timotheum ducem ipsorum:
7 et commisit cum eis prælia multa, et contriti sunt in conspectu eorum, et percussit eos:
8 et cepit Gazer civitatem et filias ejus, et reversus est in Judæam.

9 Et congregatæ sunt gentes quæ sunt in Galaad adversus Israëlitas, qui erant in finibus eorum, ut tollerent eos: et fugerunt in Datheman munitionem.
10 Et miserunt litteras ad Judam et fratres ejus, dicentes: Congregatæ sunt adversum nos gentes per circuitum, ut nos auferant,
11 et parant venire, et occupare munitionem, in quam confugimus: et Timotheus est dux exercitus eorum.
12 Nunc ergo veni, et eripe nos de manibus eorum, quia cecidit multitudo de nobis.
13 Et omnes fratres nostri, qui erant in locis Tubin, interfecti sunt: et captivas duxerunt uxores eorum, et natos, et spolia, et peremerunt illic fere mille viros.

14 Et adhuc epistolæ legebantur, et ecce alii nuntii venerunt de Galilæa conscissis tunicis, nuntiantes secundum verba hæc:
15 dicentes convenisse adversum se a Ptolemaida, et Tyro, et Sidone: et repleta est omnis Galilæa alienigenis, ut nos consumant.
16 Ut audivit autem Judas et populus sermones istos, convenit ecclesia magna cogitare quid facerent fratribus suis, qui in tribulatione erant, et expugnabantur ab eis.
17 Dixitque Judas Simoni fratri suo: Elige tibi viros, et vade, et libera fratres tuos in Galilæa: ego autem et frater meus Jonathas ibimus in Galaaditim.
18 Et reliquit Josephum filium Zachariæ, et Azariam, duces populi, cum residuo exercitu in Judæa ad custodiam:
19 et præcepit illis, dicens: Præestote populo huic: et nolite bellum committere adversum gentes, donec revertamur.
20 Et partiti sunt Simoni viri tria millia, ut iret in Galilæam: Judæ autem octo millia in Galaaditim.
21 Et abiit Simon in Galilæam, et commisit prælia multa cum gentibus: et contritæ sunt gentes a facie ejus, et persecutus est eos usque ad portam
22 Ptolemaidis: et ceciderunt de gentibus fere tria millia virorum. Et accepit spolia eorum,
23 et assumpsit eos qui erant in Galilæa et in Arbatis, cum uxoribus, et natis, et omnibus quæ erant illis, et adduxit in Judæam cum lætitia magna.

24 Et Judas Machabæus, et Jonathas frater ejus, transierunt Jordanem, et abierunt viam trium dierum per desertum.
25 Et occurrerunt eis Nabuthæi, et susceperunt eos pacifice, et narraverunt eis omnia quæ acciderant fratribus eorum in Galaaditide,
26 et quia multi ex eis comprehensi sunt in Barasa, et Bosor, et in Alimis, et in Casphor, et Mageth, et Carnaim: hæ omnes civitates munitæ et magnæ.
27 Sed et in ceteris civitatibus Galaaditidis tenentur comprehensi, et in crastinum constituerunt admovere exercitum civitatibus his, et comprehendere, et tollere eos in una die.
28 Et convertit Judas et exercitus ejus viam in desertum Bosor repente, et occupavit civitatem: et occidit omnem masculum in ore gladii, et accepit omnia spolia eorum, et succendit eam igni.
29 Et surrexerunt inde nocte, et ibant usque ad munitionem.
30 Et factum est diluculo, cum elevassent oculos suos, ecce populus multus, cujus non erat numerus, portantes scalas et machinas ut comprehenderent munitionem, et expugnarent eos.
31 Et vidit Judas quia cœpit bellum, et clamor belli ascendit ad cælum sicut tuba, et clamor magnus de civitate:
32 et dixit exercitui suo: Pugnate hodie pro fratribus vestris.
33 Et venit tribus ordinibus post eos, et exclamaverunt tubis, et clamaverunt in oratione.
34 Et cognoverunt castra Timothei quia Machabæus est, et refugerunt a facie ejus: et percusserunt eos plaga magna. Et ceciderunt ex eis in die illa fere octo millia virorum.
35 Et divertit Judas in Maspha, et expugnavit, et cepit eam: et occidit omnem masculum ejus, et sumpsit spolia ejus, et succendit eam igni.
36 Inde perrexit, et cepit Casbon, et Mageth, et Bosor, et reliquas civitates Galaaditidis.

37 Post hæc autem verba congregavit Timotheus exercitum alium, et castra posuit contra Raphon trans torrentem.
38 Et misit Judas speculari exercitum: et renuntiaverunt ei, dicentes: Quia convenerunt ad eum omnes gentes quæ in circuitu nostro sunt, exercitus multus nimis:
39 et Arabas conduxerunt in auxilium sibi, et castra posuerunt trans torrentem, parati ad te venire in prælium. Et abiit Judas obviam illis.
40 Et ait Timotheus principibus exercitus sui: Cum appropinquaverit Judas, et exercitus ejus, ad torrentem aquæ: si transierit ad nos prior, non poterimus sustinere eum, quia potens poterit adversum nos;
41 si vero timuerit transire, et posuerit castra extra flumen, transfretamus ad eos, et poterimus adversus illum.
42 Ut autem appropinquavit Judas ad torrentem aquæ, statuit scribas populi secus torrentem, et mandavit eis, dicens: Neminem hominem reliqueritis, sed veniant omnes in prælium.
43 Et transfretavit ad illos prior, et omnis populus post eum, et contritæ sunt omnes gentes a facie eorum, et projecerunt arma sua, et fugerunt ad fanum, quod erat in Carnaim.
44 Et occupavit ipsam civitatem, et fanum succendit igni cum omnibus qui erant in ipso: et oppressa est Carnaim, et non potuit sustinere contra faciem Judæ.

45 Et congregavit Judas universos Israëlitas, qui erant in Galaaditide, a minimo usque ad maximum, et uxores eorum, et natos, et exercitum magnum valde, ut venirent in terram Juda.
46 Et venerunt usque Ephron: et hæc civitas magna in ingressu posita, munita valde, et non erat declinare ab ea dextera vel sinistra, sed per mediam iter erat.
47 Et incluserunt se qui erant in civitate, et obstruxerunt portas lapidibus: et misit ad eos Judas verbis pacificis,
48 dicens: Transeamus per terram vestram, ut eamus in terram nostram: et nemo vobis nocebit, tantum pedibus transibimus. Et nolebant eis aperire.
49 Et præcepit Judas prædicare in castris, ut applicarent unusquisque in quo erat loco:
50 et applicuerunt se viri virtutis, et oppugnavit civitatem illam tota die et tota nocte, et tradita est civitas in manu ejus:
51 et peremerunt omnem masculum in ore gladii, et eradicavit eam, et accepit spolia ejus: et transivit per totam civitatem super interfectos.
52 Et transgressi sunt Jordanem in campo magno, contra faciem Bethsan.
53 Et erat Judas congregans extremos, et exhortabatur populum per totam viam, donec venirent in terram Juda:
54 et ascenderunt in montem Sion cum lætitia, et gaudio, et obtulerunt holocausta, quod nemo ex eis cecidisset donec reverterentur in pace.

55 Et in diebus quibus erat Judas et Jonathas in terra Galaad, et Simon frater ejus in Galilæa contra faciem Ptolemaidis,
56 audivit Josephus Zachariæ filius, et Azarias princeps virtutis, res bene gestas, et prælia quæ facta sunt,
57 et dixit: Faciamus et ipsi nobis nomen, et eamus pugnare adversus gentes quæ in circuitu nostro sunt.
58 Et præcepit his qui erant in exercitu suo, et abierunt Jamniam.
59 Et exivit Gorgias de civitate, et viri ejus obviam illis in pugnam.
60 Et fugati sunt Josephus et Azarias usque in fines Judææ: et ceciderunt illo die de populo Israël ad duo millia viri, et facta est fuga magna in populo:
61 quia non audierunt Judam, et fratres ejus, existimantes fortiter se facturos.
62 Ipsi autem non erant de semine virorum illorum, per quos salus facta est in Israël.

63 Et viri Juda magnificati sunt valde in conspectu omnis Israël, et gentium omnium ubi audiebatur nomen eorum.
64 Et convenerunt ad eos fausta acclamantes.
65 Et exivit Judas et fratres ejus, et expugnabant filios Esau in terra quæ ad austrum est, et percussit Chebron et filias ejus: et muros ejus, et turres succendit igni in circuitu.
66 Et movit castra ut iret in terram alienigenarum, et perambulabat Samariam.
67 In die illa ceciderunt sacerdotes in bello, dum volunt fortiter facere, dum sine consilio exeunt in prælium.
68 Et declinavit Judas in Azotum in terram alienigenarum, et diruit aras eorum, et sculptilia deorum ipsorum succendit igni: et cepit spolia civitatum, et reversus est in terram Juda.


# Μακκαβαίων Αʹ 5 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε ἤκουσαν τὰ ἔθνη κυκλόθεν ὅτι ᾠκοδομήθη τὸ θυσιαστήριον καὶ ἐνεκαινίσθη τὸ ἁγίασμα ὡς τὸ πρότερον καὶ ὠργίσθησαν σφόδρα

13 καὶ πάντες οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν οἱ ὄντες ἐν τοῖς Τουβίου τεθανάτωνται καὶ ᾐχμαλωτίκασιν τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ τὴν ἀποσκευὴν καὶ ἀπώλεσαν ἐκεῖ ὡσεὶ μίαν χιλιαρχίαν ἀνδρῶν

14 ἔτι αἱ ἐπιστολαὶ ἀνεγιγνώσκοντο καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄγγελοι ἕτεροι παρεγένοντο ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας διερρηχότες τὰ ἱμάτια ἀπαγγέλλοντες κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα

19 καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς λέγων πρόστητε τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου καὶ μὴ συνάψητε πόλεμον πρὸς τὰ ἔθνη ἕως τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι ἡμᾶς
20 καὶ ἐμερίσθησαν Σιμωνι ἄνδρες τρισχίλιοι τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν Ιουδα δὲ ἄνδρες ὀκτακισχίλιοι εἰς τὴν Γαλααδῖτιν

23 καὶ παρέλαβεν τοὺς ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας καὶ ἐν Αρβαττοις σὺν ταῖς γυναιξὶν καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἤγαγεν εἰς τὴν Ιουδαίαν με{T'} εὐφροσύνης μεγάλης

24 καὶ Ιουδας ὁ Μακκαβαῖος καὶ Ιωναθαν ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ διέβησαν τὸν Ιορδάνην καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὁδὸν τριῶν ἡμερῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ
25 καὶ συνήντησαν τοῖς Ναβαταίοις καὶ ἀπήντησαν αὐτοῖς εἰρηνικῶς καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐτοῖς πάντα τὰ συμβάντα τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ Γαλααδίτιδι
26 καὶ ὅτι πολλοὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν συνειλημμένοι εἰσὶν εἰς Βοσορρα καὶ Βοσορ ἐν Αλεμοις Χασφω Μακεδ καὶ Καρναιν πᾶσαι αἱ πόλεις αὗται ὀχυραὶ καὶ μεγάλαι

32 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν τῆς δυνάμεως πολεμήσατε σήμερον ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν
33 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐν τρισὶν ἀρχαῖς ἐξόπισθεν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ταῖς σάλπιγξιν καὶ ἐβόησαν ἐν προσευχῇ
34 καὶ ἐπέγνω ἡ παρεμβολὴ Τιμοθέου ὅτι Μακκαβαῖός ἐστιν καὶ ἔφυγον ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς πληγὴν μεγάλην καὶ ἔπεσον ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ εἰς ὀκτακισχιλίους ἄνδρας
35 καὶ ἀπέκλινεν εἰς Αλεμα καὶ ἐπολέμησεν αὐτὴν καὶ κατελάβετο αὐτὴν καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν αὐτῆς καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῆς καὶ ἐνέπρησεν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί
36 ἐκεῖθεν ἀπῆρεν καὶ προκατελάβετο τὴν Χασφω Μακεδ καὶ Βοσορ καὶ τὰς λοιπὰς πόλεις τῆς Γαλααδίτιδος

37 μετὰ δὲ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα συνήγαγεν Τιμόθεος παρεμβολὴν ἄλλην καὶ παρενέβαλεν κατὰ πρόσωπον Ραφων ἐκ πέραν τοῦ χειμάρρου
38 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιουδας κατασκοπεῦσαι τὴν παρεμβολήν καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες ἐπισυνηγμένα εἰσὶν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ ἡμῶν δύναμις πολλὴ σφόδρα
39 καὶ Ἄραβας μεμίσθωνται εἰς βοήθειαν αὐτοῖς καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν πέραν τοῦ χειμάρρου ἕτοιμοι τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ σὲ εἰς πόλεμον καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ιουδας εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῶν
40 καὶ εἶπεν Τιμόθεος τοῖς ἄρχουσιν τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ἐγγίζειν Ιουδαν καὶ τὴν παρεμβολὴν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν χειμάρρουν τοῦ ὕδατος ἐὰν διαβῇ πρὸς ἡμᾶς πρότερος οὐ δυνησόμεθα ὑποστῆναι αὐτόν ὅτι δυνάμενος δυνήσεται πρὸς ἡμᾶς
41 ἐὰν δὲ δειλανθῇ καὶ παρεμβάλῃ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ διαπεράσομεν πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ δυνησόμεθα πρὸς αὐτόν
42 ὡς δὲ ἤγγισεν Ιουδας ἐπὶ τὸν χειμάρρουν τοῦ ὕδατος ἔστησεν τοὺς γραμματεῖς τοῦ λαοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ χειμάρρου καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς λέγων μὴ ἀφῆτε πάντα ἄνθρωπον παρεμβαλεῖν ἀλλὰ ἐρχέσθωσαν πάντες εἰς τὸν πόλεμον
43 καὶ διεπέρασεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς πρότερος καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ καὶ συνετρίβησαν πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη καὶ ἔρριψαν τὰ ὅπλα αὐτῶν καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τὸ τέμενος Καρναιν
44 καὶ προκατελάβοντο τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὸ τέμενος ἐνεπύρισαν ἐν πυρὶ σὺν πᾶσιν τοῖς ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐτροπώθη Καρναιν καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο ἔτι ὑποστῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον Ιουδου

45 καὶ συνήγαγεν Ιουδας πάντα Ισραηλ τοὺς ἐν τῇ Γαλααδίτιδι ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν ἀποσκευήν παρεμβολὴν μεγάλην σφόδρα ἐλθεῖν εἰς γῆν Ιουδα
46 καὶ ἦλθον ἕως Εφρων καὶ αὕτη πόλις μεγάλη ἐπὶ τῆς ὁδοῦ ὀχυρὰ σφόδρα οὐκ ἦν ἐκκλῖναι ἀ{P'} αὐτῆς δεξιὰν ἢ ἀριστεράν ἀλ{L'} ἢ διὰ μέσου αὐτῆς πορεύεσθαι
47 καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν αὐτοὺς οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐνέφραξαν τὰς πύλας λίθοις
48 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ιουδας λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς λέγων διελευσόμεθα διὰ τῆς γῆς σου τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν εἰς τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν καὶ οὐδεὶς κακοποιήσει ὑμᾶς πλὴν τοῖς ποσὶν παρελευσόμεθα καὶ οὐκ ἠβούλοντο ἀνοῖξαι αὐτῷ
49 καὶ ἐπέταξεν Ιουδας κηρύξαι ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ τοῦ παρεμβαλεῖν ἕκαστον ἐν ᾧ ἐστιν τόπῳ
50 καὶ παρενέβαλον οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ ἐπολέμησεν τὴν πόλιν ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην καὶ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα καὶ παρεδόθη ἡ πόλις ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ
51 καὶ ἀπώλεσεν πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας καὶ ἐξερρίζωσεν αὐτὴν καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῆς καὶ διῆλθεν διὰ τῆς πόλεως ἐπάνω τῶν ἀπεκταμμένων
52 καὶ διέβησαν τὸν Ιορδάνην εἰς τὸ πεδίον τὸ μέγα κατὰ πρόσωπον Βαιθσαν
53 καὶ ἦν Ιουδας ἐπισυνάγων τοὺς ἐσχατίζοντας καὶ παρακαλῶν τὸν λαὸν κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ὁδόν ἕως ἦλθεν εἰς γῆν Ιουδα
54 καὶ ἀνέβησαν εἰς ὄρος Σιων ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ καὶ χαρᾷ καὶ προσήγαγον ὁλοκαυτώματα ὅτι οὐκ ἔπεσεν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐθεὶς ἕως τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι ἐν εἰρήνῃ

55 καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐν αἷς ἦν Ιουδας καὶ Ιωναθαν ἐν γῇ Γαλααδ καὶ Σιμων ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ κατὰ πρόσωπον Πτολεμαίδος
56 ἤκουσεν Ιωσηφ ὁ τοῦ Ζαχαριου καὶ Αζαριας ἄρχοντες τῆς δυνάμεως τῶν ἀνδραγαθιῶν καὶ τοῦ πολέμου οἷα ἐποίησαν
57 καὶ εἶπον ποιήσωμεν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἑαυτοῖς ὄνομα καὶ πορευθῶμεν πολεμῆσαι πρὸς τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ ἡμῶν
58 καὶ παρήγγειλεν τοῖς ἀπὸ τῆς δυνάμεως τῆς με{T'} αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐπὶ Ιάμνειαν
59 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Γοργίας ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς εἰς πόλεμον
60 καὶ ἐτροπώθη Ιωσηπος καὶ Αζαριας καὶ ἐδιώχθησαν ἕως τῶν ὁρίων τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ ἔπεσον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ Ισραηλ εἰς δισχιλίους ἄνδρας
61 καὶ ἐγενήθη τροπὴ μεγάλη ἐν τῷ λαῷ ὅτι οὐκ ἤκουσαν Ιουδου καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ οἰόμενοι ἀνδραγαθῆσαι
62 αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἦσαν ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων οἷς ἐδόθη σωτηρία Ισραηλ διὰ χειρὸς αὐτῶν

63 καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ Ιουδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐδοξάσθησαν σφόδρα ἔναντι παντὸς Ισραηλ καὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν πάντων οὗ ἠκούετο τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν
64 καὶ ἐπισυνήγοντο πρὸς αὐτοὺς εὐφημοῦντες
65 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ιουδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπολέμουν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ησαυ ἐν τῇ γῇ τῇ πρὸς νότον καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὴν Χεβρων καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῆς καὶ καθεῖλεν τὰ ὀχυρώματα αὐτῆς καὶ τοὺς πύργους αὐτῆς ἐνεπύρισεν κυκλόθεν
66 καὶ ἀπῆρεν τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς γῆν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ διεπορεύετο τὴν Μαρισαν
67 ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔπεσον ἱερεῖς ἐν πολέμῳ βουλόμενοι ἀνδραγαθῆσαι ἐν τῷ αὐτοὺς ἐξελθεῖν εἰς πόλεμον ἀβουλεύτως
68 καὶ ἐξέκλινεν Ιουδας εἰς Ἄζωτον γῆν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ καθεῖλεν τοὺς βωμοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ γλυπτὰ τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν κατέκαυσεν πυρὶ καὶ ἐσκύλευσεν τὰ σκῦλα τῶν πόλεων καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς γῆν Ιουδα
