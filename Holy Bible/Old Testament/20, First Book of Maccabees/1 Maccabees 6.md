# First Book of Maccabees 6 (RSVCE)

### The Last Days of Antiochus Epiphanes
1 King Antiʹochus was going through the upper provinces when he heard that Elymaʹis in Persia was a city famed for its wealth in silver and gold.
2 Its temple was very rich, containing golden shields, breastplates, and weapons left there by Alexander, the son of Philip, the Macedonian king who first reigned over the Greeks.
3 So he came and tried to take the city and plunder it, but he could not, because his plan became known to the men of the city
4 and they withstood him in battle. So he fled and in great grief departed from there to return to Babylon.
5 Then some one came to him in Persia and reported that the armies which had gone into the land of Judah had been routed;
6 that Lysʹias had gone first with a strong force, but had turned and fled before the Jews; that the Jews had grown strong from the arms, supplies, and abundant spoils which they had taken from the armies they had cut down;
7 that they had torn down the abomination which he had erected upon the altar in Jerusalem; and that they had surrounded the sanctuary with high walls as before, and also Beth-zur, his city.
8 When the king heard this news, he was astounded and badly shaken. He took to his bed and became sick from grief, because things had not turned out for him as he had planned.
9 He lay there for many days, because deep grief continually gripped him, and he concluded that he was dying.
10 So he called all his friends and said to them, “Sleep departs from my eyes and I am downhearted with worry.
11 I said to myself, ‘To what distress I have come! And into what a great flood I now am plunged! For I was kind and beloved in my power.’
12 But now I remember the evils I did in Jerusalem. I seized all her vessels of silver and gold; and I sent to destroy the inhabitants of Judah without good reason.
13 I know that it is because of this that these evils have come upon me; and behold, I am perishing of deep grief in a strange land.”
14 Then he called for Philip, one of his friends, and made him ruler over all his kingdom.
15 He gave him the crown and his robe and the signet, that he might guide Antiʹochus his son and bring him up to be king.
16 Thus Antiʹochus the king died there in the one hundred and forty-ninth year.
17 And when Lysʹias learned that the king was dead, he set up Antiʹochus the king’s son to reign. Lysʹias had brought him up as a boy, and he named him Euʹpator.
### Renewed Attacks from Syria
18 Now the men in the citadel kept hemming Israel in around the sanctuary. They were trying in every way to harm them and strengthen the Gentiles.
19 So Judas decided to destroy them, and assembled all the people to besiege them.
20 They gathered together and besieged the citadel in the one hundred and fiftieth year; and he built siege towers and other engines of war.
21 But some of the garrison escaped from the siege and some of the ungodly Israelites joined them.
22 They went to the king and said, “How long will you fail to do justice and to avenge our brethren?
23 We were happy to serve your father, to live by what he said and to follow his commands.
24 For this reason the sons of our people besieged the citadel and became hostile to us; moreover, they have put to death as many of us as they have caught, and they have seized our inheritances.
25 And not against us alone have they stretched out their hands, but also against all the lands on their borders.
26 And behold, today they have encamped against the citadel in Jerusalem to take it; they have fortified both the sanctuary and Beth-zur;
27 and unless you quickly prevent them, they will do still greater things, and you will not be able to stop them.”
28 The king was enraged when he heard this. He assembled all his friends, the commanders of his forces and those in authority.
29 And mercenary forces came to him from other kingdoms and from islands of the seas.
30 The number of his forces was a hundred thousand foot soldiers, twenty thousand horsemen, and thirty-two elephants accustomed to war.
31 They came through Idumeʹa and encamped against Beth-zur, and for many days they fought and built engines of war; but the Jews sallied out and burned these with fire, and fought manfully.
### The Battle at Beth-zechariah
32 Then Judas marched away from the citadel and encamped at Beth-zechariʹah, opposite the camp of the king.
33 Early in the morning the king rose and took his army by a forced march along the road to Beth-zechariʹah, and his troops made ready for battle and sounded their trumpets.
34 They showed the elephants the juice of grapes and mulberries, to arouse them for battle.
35 And they distributed the beasts among the phalanxes; with each elephant they stationed a thousand men armed with coats of mail, and with brass helmets on their heads; and five hundred picked horsemen were assigned to each beast.
36 These took their position beforehand wherever the beast was; wherever it went they went with it, and they never left it.
37 And upon the elephants were wooden towers, strong and covered; they were fastened upon each beast by special harness, and upon each were four armed men who fought from there, and also its Indian driver.
38 The rest of the horsemen were stationed on either side, on the two flanks of the army, to harass the enemy while being themselves protected by the phalanxes.
39 When the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the hills were ablaze with them and gleamed like flaming torches.
40 Now a part of the king’s army was spread out on the high hills, and some troops were on the plain, and they advanced steadily and in good order.
41 All who heard the noise made by their multitude, by the marching of the multitude and the clanking of their arms, trembled, for the army was very large and strong.
42 But Judas and his army advanced to the battle, and six hundred men of the king’s army fell.
43 And Eleaʹzar, called Avʹaran, saw that one of the beasts was equipped with royal armor. It was taller than all the others, and he supposed that the king was upon it.
44 So he gave his life to save his people and to win for himself an everlasting name.
45 He courageously ran into the midst of the phalanx to reach it; he killed men right and left, and they parted before him on both sides.
46 He got under the elephant, stabbed it from beneath, and killed it; but it fell to the ground upon him and there he died.
47 And when the Jews saw the royal might and the fierce attack of the forces, they turned away in flight.
### The Siege of the Temple
48 The soldiers of the king’s army went up to Jerusalem against them, and the king encamped in Judea and at Mount Zion.
49 He made peace with the men of Beth-zur, and they evacuated the city, because they had no provisions there to withstand a siege, since it was a sabbatical year for the land.
50 So the king took Beth-zur and stationed a guard there to hold it.
51 Then he encamped before the sanctuary for many days. He set up siege towers, engines of war to throw fire and stones, machines to shoot arrows, and catapults.
52 The Jews also made engines of war to match theirs, and fought for many days.
53 But they had no food in storage, because it was the seventh year; those who found safety in Judea from the Gentiles had consumed the last of the stores.
54 Few men were left in the sanctuary, because famine had prevailed over the rest and they had been scattered, each to his own place.
### Syria Offers Terms
55 Then Lysʹias heard that Philip, whom King Antiʹochus while still living had appointed to bring up Antiʹochus his son to be king,
56 had returned from Persia and Media with the forces that had gone with the king, and that he was trying to seize control of the government.
57 So he quickly gave orders to depart, and said to the king, to the commanders of the forces, and to the men, “We daily grow weaker, our food supply is scant, the place against which we are fighting is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom press urgently upon us.
58 Now then let us come to terms with these men, and make peace with them and with all their nation,
59 and agree to let them live by their laws as they did before; for it was on account of their laws which we abolished that they became angry and did all these things.”
60 The speech pleased the king and the commanders, and he sent to the Jews an offer of peace, and they accepted it.
61 So the king and the commanders gave them their oath. On these conditions the Jews evacuated the stronghold.
62 But when the king entered Mount Zion and saw what a strong fortress the place was, he broke the oath he had sworn and gave orders to tear down the wall all around.
63 Then he departed with haste and returned to Antioch. He found Philip in control of the city, but he fought against him, and took the city by force.


# Liber Primus Machabaeorum 6 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et rex Antiochus perambulabat superiores regiones, et audivit esse civitatem Elymaidem in Perside nobilissimam, et copiosam in argento et auro,
2 templumque in ea locuples valde, et illic velamina aurea, et loricæ, et scuta, quæ reliquit Alexander Philippi rex Macedo, qui regnavit primus in Græcia.
3 Et venit, et quærebat capere civitatem, et deprædari eam: et non potuit, quoniam innotuit sermo his qui erant in civitate:
4 et insurrexerunt in prælium, et fugit inde, et abiit cum tristitia magna, et reversus est in Babyloniam.

5 Et venit qui nuntiaret ei in Perside, quia fugata sunt castra quæ erant in terra Juda:
6 et quia abiit Lysias cum virtute forti in primis, et fugatus est a facie Judæorum, et invaluerunt armis, et viribus, et spoliis multis, quæ ceperunt de castris, quæ exciderunt:
7 et quia diruerunt abominationem, quam ædificaverat super altare quod erat in Jerusalem: et sanctificationem, sicut prius, circumdederunt muris excelsis, sed et Bethsuram civitatem suam.

8 Et factum est ut audivit rex sermones istos, expavit, et commotus est valde: et decidit in lectum, et incidit in languorem præ tristitia, quia non factum est ei sicut cogitabat.
9 Et erat illic per dies multos, quia renovata est in eo tristitia magna, et arbitratus est se mori.
10 Et vocavit omnes amicos suos, et dixit illis: Recessit somnus ab oculis meis, et concidi, et corrui corde præ sollicitudine:
11 et dixi in corde meo: In quantam tribulationem deveni, et in quos fluctus tristitiæ, in qua nunc sum: qui jucundus eram, et dilectus in potestate mea!
12 Nunc vero reminiscor malorum quæ feci in Jerusalem, unde et abstuli omnia spolia aurea et argentea quæ erant in ea, et misi auferre habitantes Judæam sine causa.
13 Cognovi ergo quia propterea invenerunt me mala ista: et ecce pereo tristitia magna in terra aliena.
14 Et vocavit Philippum, unum de amicis suis, et præposuit eum super universum regnum suum:
15 et dedit ei diadema, et stolam suam, et annulum, ut adduceret Antiochum filium suum, et nutriret eum, et regnaret.
16 Et mortuus est illic Antiochus rex anno centesimo quadragesimo nono.
17 Et cognovit Lysias quoniam mortuus est rex, et constituit regnare Antiochum filium ejus, quem nutrivit adolescentem: et vocavit nomen ejus Eupator.

18 Et hi qui erant in arce, concluserant Israël in circuitu sanctorum: et quærebant eis mala semper, et firmamentum gentium.
19 Et cogitavit Judas disperdere eos: et convocavit universum populum, ut obsiderent eos.
20 Et convenerunt simul, et obsederunt eos anno centesimo quinquagesimo, et fecerunt ballistas et machinas.
21 Et exierunt quidam ex eis qui obsidebantur: et adjunxerunt se illis aliqui impii ex Israël,
22 et abierunt ad regem, et dixerunt: Quousque non facis judicium, et vindicas fratres nostros?
23 Nos decrevimus servire patri tuo, et ambulare in præceptis ejus, et obsequi edictis ejus:
24 et filii populi nostri propter hoc alienabant se a nobis, et quicumque inveniebantur ex nobis, interficiebantur, et hæreditates nostræ diripiebantur.
25 Et non ad nos tantum extenderunt manum, sed et in omnes fines nostros:
26 et ecce applicuerunt hodie ad arcem Jerusalem occupare eam, et munitionem Bethsuram munierunt:
27 et nisi præveneris eos velocius, majora quam hæc facient, et non poteris obtinere eos.

28 Et iratus est rex, ut hæc audivit: et convocavit omnes amicos suos, et principes exercitus sui, et eos qui super equites erant:
29 sed et de regnis aliis et de insulis maritimis venerunt ad eum exercitus conductitii.
30 Et erat numerus exercitus ejus, centum millia peditum, et viginti millia equitum, et elephanti triginta duo, docti ad prælium.
31 Et venerunt per Idumæam, et applicuerunt ad Bethsuram, et pugnaverunt dies multos: et fecerunt machinas, et exierunt, et succenderunt eas igni, et pugnaverunt viriliter.

32 Et recessit Judas ab arce, et movit castra ad Bethzacharam contra castra regis.
33 Et surrexit rex ante lucem, et concitavit exercitus in impetum contra viam Bethzacharam: et comparaverunt se exercitus in prælium, et tubis cecinerunt:
34 et elephantis ostenderunt sanguinem uvæ et mori, ad acuendos eos in prælium:
35 et diviserunt bestias per legiones, et astiterunt singulis elephantis mille viri in loricis concatenatis, et galeæ æreæ in capitibus eorum: et quingenti equites ordinati unicuique bestiæ electi erant.
36 Hi ante tempus, ubicumque erat bestia, ibi erant: et quocumque ibat, ibant, et non discedebant ab ea.
37 Sed et turres ligneæ super eos firmæ protegentes super singulas bestias: et super eas machinæ: et super singulas viri virtutis triginta duo, qui pugnabant desuper: et Indus magister bestiæ.
38 Et residuum equitatum hinc et inde statuit in duas partes, tubis exercitum commovere, et perurgere constipatos in legionibus ejus.
39 Et ut refulsit sol in clypeos aureos et æreos, resplenduerunt montes ab eis, et resplenduerunt sicut lampades ignis.
40 Et distincta est pars exercitus regis per montes excelsos, et alia per loca humilia: et ibant caute et ordinate.
41 Et commovebantur omnes inhabitantes terram a voce multitudinis, et incessu turbæ, et collisione armorum: erat enim exercitus magnus valde, et fortis.
42 Et appropiavit Judas et exercitus ejus in prælium, et ceciderunt de exercitu regis sexcenti viri.

43 Et vidit Eleazar filius Saura unam de bestiis loricatam loricis regis: et erat eminens super ceteras bestias, et visum est ei quod in ea esset rex:
44 et dedit se ut liberaret populum suum, et acquireret sibi nomen æternum.
45 Et cucurrit ad eam audacter in medio legionis, interficiens a dextris et a sinistris, et cadebant ab eo huc atque illuc.
46 Et ivit sub pedes elephantis, et supposuit se ei, et occidit eum: et cecidit in terram super ipsum, et mortuus est illic.

47 Et videntes virtutem regis, et impetum exercitus ejus, diverterunt se ab eis.
48 Castra autem regis ascenderunt contra eos in Jerusalem, et applicuerunt castra regis ad Judæam, et montem Sion.
49 Et fecit pacem cum his qui erant in Bethsura: et exierunt de civitate, quia non erant eis ibi alimenta conclusis, quia sabbata erant terræ.
50 Et comprehendit rex Bethsuram: et constituit illic custodiam servare eam.
51 Et convertit castra ad locum sanctificationis dies multos: et statuit illic ballistas, et machinas, et ignis jacula, et tormenta ad lapides jactandos, et spicula, et scorpios ad mittendas sagittas, et fundibula.
52 Fecerunt autem et ipsi machinas adversus machinas eorum, et pugnaverunt dies multos.
53 Escæ autem non erant in civitate, eo quod septimus annus esset: et qui remanserant in Judæa de gentibus, consumpserant reliquias eorum, quæ repositæ fuerant.
54 Et remanserunt in sanctis viri pauci, quoniam obtinuerat eos fames: et dispersi sunt unusquisque in locum suum.

55 Et audivit Lysias quod Philippus, quem constituerat rex Antiochus cum adhuc viveret, ut nutriret Antiochum filium suum, et regnaret,
56 reversus esset a Perside et Media, et exercitus qui abierat cum ipso, et quia quærebat suscipere regni negotia:
57 festinavit ire, et dicere ad regem, et duces exercitus: Deficimus quotidie, et esca nobis modica est; et locus, quem obsidemus, est munitus, et incumbit nobis ordinare de regno.
58 Nunc itaque demus dextras hominibus istis, et faciamus cum illis pacem, et cum omni gente eorum:
59 et constituamus illis ut ambulent in legitimis suis sicut prius: propter legitima enim ipsorum, quæ despeximus, irati sunt, et fecerunt omnia hæc.
60 Et placuit sermo in conspectu regis et principum: et misit ad eos pacem facere, et receperunt illam.
61 Et juravit illis rex et principes, et exierunt de munitione.
62 Et intravit rex montem Sion, et vidit munitionem loci: et rupit citius juramentum quod juravit, et mandavit destruere murum in gyro.
63 Et discessit festinanter, et reversus est Antiochiam, et invenit Philippum dominantem civitati: et pugnavit adversus eum, et occupavit civitatem.


# Μακκαβαίων Αʹ 6 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀντίοχος διεπορεύετο τὰς ἐπάνω χώρας καὶ ἤκουσεν ὅτι ἐστὶν Ἐλυμαῒς ἐν τῇ Περσίδι πόλις ἔνδοξος πλούτῳ ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσίῳ
2 καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν τὸ ἐν αὐτῇ πλούσιον σφόδρα καὶ ἐκεῖ καλύμματα χρυσᾶ καὶ θώρακες καὶ ὅπλα ἃ κατέλιπεν ἐκεῖ Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ τοῦ Φιλίππου ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ Μακεδών ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν πρῶτος ἐν τοῖς Ἕλλησι
3 καὶ ἦλθεν καὶ ἐζήτει καταλαβέσθαι τὴν πόλιν καὶ προνομεῦσαι αὐτήν καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνάσθη ὅτι ἐγνώσθη ὁ λόγος τοῖς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως
4 καὶ ἀντέστησαν αὐτῷ εἰς πόλεμον καὶ ἔφυγεν καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἐκεῖθεν μετὰ λύπης μεγάλης ἀποστρέψαι εἰς Βαβυλῶνα

5 καὶ ἦλθέν τις ἀπαγγέλλων αὐτῷ εἰς τὴν Περσίδα ὅτι τετρόπωνται αἱ παρεμβολαὶ αἱ πορευθεῖσαι εἰς γῆν Ιουδα
6 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Λυσίας δυνάμει ἰσχυρᾷ ἐν πρώτοις καὶ ἐνετράπη ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπίσχυσαν ὅπλοις καὶ δυνάμει καὶ σκύλοις πολλοῖς οἷς ἔλαβον ἀπὸ τῶν παρεμβολῶν ὧν ἐξέκοψαν
7 καὶ καθεῖλον τὸ βδέλυγμα ὃ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τὸ ἁγίασμα καθὼς τὸ πρότερον ἐκύκλωσαν τείχεσιν ὑψηλοῖς καὶ τὴν Βαιθσουραν πόλιν αὐτοῦ

8 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἐθαμβήθη καὶ ἐσαλεύθη σφόδρα καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὴν κοίτην καὶ ἐνέπεσεν εἰς ἀρρωστίαν ἀπὸ τῆς λύπης ὅτι οὐκ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ καθὼς ἐνεθυμεῖτο
9 καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας πλείους ὅτι ἀνεκαινίσθη ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν λύπη μεγάλη καὶ ἐλογίσατο ὅτι ἀποθνῄσκει
10 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν πάντας τοὺς φίλους αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς ἀφίσταται ὁ ὕπνος ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου καὶ συμπέπτωκα τῇ καρδίᾳ ἀπὸ τῆς μερίμνης
11 καὶ εἶπα τῇ καρδίᾳ ἕως τίνος θλίψεως ἦλθα καὶ κλύδωνος μεγάλου ἐν ᾧ νῦν εἰμι ὅτι χρηστὸς καὶ ἀγαπώμενος ἤμην ἐν τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ μου
12 νῦν δὲ μιμνῄσκομαι τῶν κακῶν ὧν ἐποίησα ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἔλαβον πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἀργυρᾶ καὶ τὰ χρυσᾶ τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ ἐξαπέστειλα ἐξᾶραι τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ιουδα διὰ κενῆς
13 ἔγνων ὅτι χάριν τούτων εὗρέν με τὰ κακὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀπόλλυμαι λύπῃ μεγάλῃ ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ
14 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Φίλιππον ἕνα τῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ πάσης τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τὸ διάδημα καὶ τὴν στολὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν δακτύλιον τοῦ ἀγαγεῖν Ἀντίοχον τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκθρέψαι αὐτὸν τοῦ βασιλεύειν
16 καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ Ἀντίοχος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἔτους ἐνάτου καὶ τεσσαρακοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ
17 καὶ ἐπέγνω Λυσίας ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ βασιλεύς καὶ κατέστησεν βασιλεύειν Ἀντίοχον τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ὃν ἐξέθρεψεν νεώτερον καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Εὐπάτωρ

18 καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας ἦσαν συγκλείοντες τὸν Ισραηλ κύκλῳ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ ζητοῦντες κακὰ δ{I'} ὅλου καὶ στήριγμα τοῖς ἔθνεσιν
19 καὶ ἐλογίσατο Ιουδας ἐξᾶραι αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐξεκκλησίασε πάντα τὸν λαὸν τοῦ περικαθίσαι ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
20 καὶ συνήχθησαν ἅμα καὶ περιεκάθισαν ἐ{P'} αὐτὴν ἔτους πεντηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ καὶ ἐποίησεν βελοστάσεις καὶ μηχανάς
21 καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐκ τοῦ συγκλεισμοῦ καὶ ἐκολλήθησαν αὐτοῖς τινες τῶν ἀσεβῶν ἐξ Ισραηλ
22 καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ εἶπον ἕως πότε οὐ ποιήσῃ κρίσιν καὶ ἐκδικήσεις τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ἡμῶν
23 ἡμεῖς εὐδοκοῦμεν δουλεύειν τῷ πατρί σου καὶ πορεύεσθαι τοῖς ὑ{P'} αὐτοῦ λεγομένοις καὶ κατακολουθεῖν τοῖς προστάγμασιν αὐτοῦ
24 καὶ περιεκάθηντο ἐ{P'} αὐτὴν οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ λαοῦ ἡμῶν χάριν τούτου καὶ ἠλλοτριοῦντο ἀ{F'} ἡμῶν πλὴν ὅσοι εὑρίσκοντο ἐξ ἡμῶν ἐθανατοῦντο καὶ αἱ κληρονομίαι ἡμῶν διηρπάζοντο
25 καὶ οὐκ ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς μόνον ἐξέτειναν χεῖρα ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν
26 καὶ ἰδοὺ παρεμβεβλήκασι σήμερον ἐπὶ τὴν ἄκραν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τοῦ καταλαβέσθαι αὐτήν καὶ τὸ ἁγίασμα καὶ τὴν Βαιθσουραν ὠχύρωσαν
27 καὶ ἐὰν μὴ προκαταλάβῃ αὐτοὺς διὰ τάχους μείζονα τούτων ποιήσουσιν καὶ οὐ δυνήσῃ τοῦ κατασχεῖν αὐτῶν

28 καὶ ὠργίσθη ὁ βασιλεύς ὅτε ἤκουσεν καὶ συνήγαγεν πάντας τοὺς φίλους αὐτοῦ ἄρχοντας δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν ἡνιῶν
29 καὶ ἀπὸ βασιλειῶν ἑτέρων καὶ ἀπὸ νήσων θαλασσῶν ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν δυνάμεις μισθωταί
30 καὶ ἦν ὁ ἀριθμὸς τῶν δυνάμεων αὐτοῦ ἑκατὸν χιλιάδες πεζῶν καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες ἱππέων καὶ ἐλέφαντες δύο καὶ τριάκοντα εἰδότες πόλεμον
31 καὶ ἦλθον διὰ τῆς Ιδουμαίας καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ Βαιθσουραν καὶ ἐπολέμησαν ἡμέρας πολλὰς καὶ ἐποίησαν μηχανάς καὶ ἐξῆλθον καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν αὐτὰς πυρὶ καὶ ἐπολέμησαν ἀνδρωδῶς

32 καὶ ἀπῆρεν Ιουδας ἀπὸ τῆς ἄκρας καὶ παρενέβαλεν εἰς Βαιθζαχαρια ἀπέναντι τῆς παρεμβολῆς τοῦ βασιλέως
33 καὶ ὤρθρισεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ πρωὶ καὶ ἀπῆρεν τὴν παρεμβολὴν ἐν ὁρμήματι αὐτῆς κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν Βαιθζαχαρια καὶ διεσκευάσθησαν αἱ δυνάμεις εἰς τὸν πόλεμον καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ταῖς σάλπιγξιν
34 καὶ τοῖς ἐλέφασιν ἔδειξαν αἷμα σταφυλῆς καὶ μόρων τοῦ παραστῆσαι αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν πόλεμον
35 καὶ διεῖλον τὰ θηρία εἰς τὰς φάλαγγας καὶ παρέστησαν ἑκάστῳ ἐλέφαντι χιλίους ἄνδρας τεθωρακισμένους ἐν ἁλυσιδωτοῖς καὶ περικεφαλαῖαι χαλκαῖ ἐπὶ τῶν κεφαλῶν αὐτῶν καὶ πεντακοσία ἵππος διατεταγμένη ἑκάστῳ θηρίῳ ἐκλελεγμένη
36 οὗτοι πρὸ καιροῦ οὗ ἂν ᾖ τὸ θηρίον ἦσαν καὶ οὗ ἐὰν ἐπορεύετο ἐπορεύοντο ἅμα οὐκ ἀφίσταντο ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
37 καὶ πύργοι ξύλινοι ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ὀχυροὶ σκεπαζόμενοι ἐ{F'} ἑκάστου θηρίου ἐζωσμένοι ἐ{P'} αὐτοῦ μηχαναῖς καὶ ἐ{F'} ἑκάστου ἄνδρες δυνάμεως τέσσαρες οἱ πολεμοῦντες ἐ{P'} αὐτοῖς καὶ ὁ Ἰνδὸς αὐτοῦ
38 καὶ τὴν ἐπίλοιπον ἵππον ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν ἔστησεν ἐπὶ τὰ δύο μέρη τῆς παρεμβολῆς κατασείοντες καὶ καταφρασσόμενοι ἐν ταῖς φάλαγξιν
39 ὡς δὲ ἔστιλβεν ὁ ἥλιος ἐπὶ τὰς χρυσᾶς καὶ χαλκᾶς ἀσπίδας ἔστιλβεν τὰ ὄρη ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν καὶ κατηύγαζεν ὡς λαμπάδες πυρός
40 καὶ ἐξετάθη μέρος τι τῆς παρεμβολῆς τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπὶ τὰ ὑψηλὰ ὄρη καί τινες ἐπὶ τὰ ταπεινά καὶ ἤρχοντο ἀσφαλῶς καὶ τεταγμένως
41 καὶ ἐσαλεύοντο πάντες οἱ ἀκούοντες φωνῆς πλήθους αὐτῶν καὶ ὁδοιπορίας τοῦ πλήθους καὶ συγκρουσμοῦ τῶν ὅπλων ἦν γὰρ ἡ παρεμβολὴ μεγάλη σφόδρα καὶ ἰσχυρά
42 καὶ ἤγγισεν Ιουδας καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς παράταξιν καὶ ἔπεσον ἀπὸ τῆς παρεμβολῆς τοῦ βασιλέως ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες

43 καὶ εἶδεν Ελεαζαρος ὁ Αυαραν ἓν τῶν θηρίων τεθωρακισμένον θώραξιν βασιλικοῖς καὶ ἦν ὑπεράγον πάντα τὰ θηρία καὶ ᾠήθη ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ ἐστιν ὁ βασιλεύς
44 καὶ ἔδωκεν ἑαυτὸν τοῦ σῶσαι τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ περιποιῆσαι ἑαυτῷ ὄνομα αἰώνιον
45 καὶ ἐπέδραμεν αὐτῷ θράσει εἰς μέσον τῆς φάλαγγος καὶ ἐθανάτου δεξιὰ καὶ εὐώνυμα καὶ ἐσχίζοντο ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα
46 καὶ εἰσέδυ ὑπὸ τὸν ἐλέφαντα καὶ ὑπέθηκεν αὐτῷ καὶ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτόν καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐπάνω αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ

47 καὶ εἶδον τὴν ἰσχὺν τῆς βασιλείας καὶ τὸ ὅρμημα τῶν δυνάμεων καὶ ἐξέκλιναν ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν
48 οἱ δὲ ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς τοῦ βασιλέως ἀνέβαινον εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῶν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ παρενέβαλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὴν Ιουδαίαν καὶ εἰς τὸ ὄρος Σιων
49 καὶ ἐποίησεν εἰρήνην μετὰ τῶν ἐκ Βαιθσουρων καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὅτι οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς ἐκεῖ διατροφὴ τοῦ συγκεκλεῖσθαι ἐν αὐτῇ ὅτι σάββατον ἦν τῇ γῇ
50 καὶ κατελάβετο ὁ βασιλεὺς τὴν Βαιθσουραν καὶ ἀπέταξεν ἐκεῖ φρουρὰν τηρεῖν αὐτήν
51 καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ τὸ ἁγίασμα ἡμέρας πολλὰς καὶ ἔστησεν ἐκεῖ βελοστάσεις καὶ μηχανὰς καὶ πυροβόλα καὶ λιθοβόλα καὶ σκορπίδια εἰς τὸ βάλλεσθαι βέλη καὶ σφενδόνας
52 καὶ ἐποίησαν καὶ αὐτοὶ μηχανὰς πρὸς τὰς μηχανὰς αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπολέμησαν ἡμέρας πολλάς
53 βρώματα δὲ οὐκ ἦν ἐν τοῖς ἀγγείοις διὰ τὸ ἕβδομον ἔτος εἶναι καὶ οἱ ἀνασῳζόμενοι εἰς τὴν Ιουδαίαν ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν κατέφαγον τὸ ὑπόλειμμα τῆς παραθέσεως
54 καὶ ὑπελείφθησαν ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις ἄνδρες ὀλίγοι ὅτι κατεκράτησεν αὐτῶν ὁ λιμός καὶ ἐσκορπίσθησαν ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ

55 καὶ ἤκουσεν Λυσίας ὅτι Φίλιππος ὃν κατέστησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀντίοχος ἔτι ζῶντος αὐτοῦ ἐκθρέψαι Ἀντίοχον τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτόν
56 ἀπέστρεψεν ἀπὸ τῆς Περσίδος καὶ Μηδίας καὶ αἱ δυνάμεις αἱ πορευθεῖσαι μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ὅτι ζητεῖ παραλαβεῖν τὰ τῶν πραγμάτων
57 καὶ κατέσπευδεν καὶ ἐπένευσεν τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ τοὺς ἡγεμόνας τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐκλείπομεν κα{Q'} ἡμέραν καὶ ἡ τροφὴ ἡμῖν ὀλίγη καὶ ὁ τόπος οὗ παρεμβάλλομέν ἐστιν ὀχυρός καὶ ἐπίκειται ἡμῖν τὰ τῆς βασιλείας
58 νῦν οὖν δῶμεν δεξιὰς τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τούτοις καὶ ποιήσωμεν με{T'} αὐτῶν εἰρήνην καὶ μετὰ παντὸς ἔθνους αὐτῶν
59 καὶ στήσωμεν αὐτοῖς τοῦ πορεύεσθαι τοῖς νομίμοις αὐτῶν ὡς τὸ πρότερον χάριν γὰρ τῶν νομίμων αὐτῶν ὧν διεσκεδάσαμεν ὠργίσθησαν καὶ ἐποίησαν ταῦτα πάντα
60 καὶ ἤρεσεν ὁ λόγος ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰρηνεῦσαι καὶ ἐπεδέξαντο
61 καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ἐπὶ τούτοις ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τοῦ ὀχυρώματος
62 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς ὄρος Σιων καὶ εἶδεν τὸ ὀχύρωμα τοῦ τόπου καὶ ἠθέτησεν τὸν ὁρκισμόν ὃν ὤμοσεν καὶ ἐνετείλατο καθελεῖν τὸ τεῖχος κυκλόθεν
63 καὶ ἀπῆρεν κατὰ σπουδὴν καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν καὶ εὗρεν Φίλιππον κυριεύοντα τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐπολέμησεν πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ κατελάβετο τὴν πόλιν βίᾳ
