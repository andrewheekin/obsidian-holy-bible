# First Book of Maccabees 13 (RSVCE)

### Simon Takes Command
1 Simon heard that Trypho had assembled a large army to invade the land of Judah and destroy it,
2 and he saw that the people were trembling and fearful. So he went up to Jerusalem, and gathering the people together
3 he encouraged them, saying to them, “You yourselves know what great things I and my brothers and the house of my father have done for the laws and the sanctuary; you know also the wars and the difficulties which we have seen.
4 By reason of this all my brothers have perished for the sake of Israel, and I alone am left.
5 And now, far be it from me to spare my life in any time of distress, for I am not better than my brothers.
6 But I will avenge my nation and the sanctuary and your wives and children, for all the nations have gathered together out of hatred to destroy us.”
7 The spirit of the people was rekindled when they heard these words,
8 and they answered in a loud voice, “You are our leader in place of Judas and Jonathan your brother.
9 Fight our battles, and all that you say to us we will do.”
10 So he assembled all the warriors and hastened to complete the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it on every side.
11 He sent Jonathan the son of Abʹsalom to Joppa, and with him a considerable army; he drove out its occupants and remained there.
### Deceit and Treachery of Trypho
12 Then Trypho departed from Ptolemaʹis with a large army to invade the land of Judah, and Jonathan was with him under guard.
13 And Simon encamped in Adʹida, facing the plain.
14 Trypho learned that Simon had risen up in place of Jonathan his brother, and that he was about to join battle with him, so he sent envoys to him and said,
15 “It is for the money that Jonathan your brother owed the royal treasury, in connection with the offices he held, that we are detaining him.
16 Send now a hundred talents of silver and two of his sons as hostages, so that when released he will not revolt against us, and we will release him.”
17 Simon knew that they were speaking deceitfully to him, but he sent to get the money and the sons, lest he arouse great hostility among the people, who might say,
18 “Because Simon did not send him the money and the sons, he perished.”
19 So he sent the sons and the hundred talents, but Trypho broke his word and did not release Jonathan.
20 After this Trypho came to invade the country and destroy it, and he circled around by the way to Adorʹa. But Simon and his army kept marching along opposite him to every place he went.
21 Now the men in the citadel kept sending envoys to Trypho urging him to come to them by way of the wilderness and to send them food.
22 So Trypho got all his cavalry ready to go, but that night a very heavy snow fell, and he did not go because of the snow. He marched off and went into the land of Gilʹead.
23 When he approached Basʹkama, he killed Jonathan, and he was buried there.
24 Then Trypho turned back and departed to his own land.
### Jonathan’s Tomb
25 And Simon sent and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried him in Moʹde-in, the city of his fathers.
26 All Israel bewailed him with great lamentation, and mourned for him many days.
27 And Simon built a monument over the tomb of his father and his brothers; he made it high that it might be seen, with polished stone at the front and back.
28 He also erected seven pyramids, opposite one another, for his father and mother and four brothers.
29 And for the pyramids he devised an elaborate setting, erecting about them great columns, and upon the columns he put suits of armor for a permanent memorial, and beside the suits of armor carved ships, so that they could be seen by all who sail the sea.
30 This is the tomb which he built in Moʹde-in; it remains to this day.
### Judea Gains Independence
31 Trypho dealt treacherously with the young king Antiʹochus; he killed him
32 and became king in his place, putting on the crown of Asia; and he brought great calamity upon the land.
33 But Simon built up the strongholds of Judea and walled them all around, with high towers and great walls and gates and bolts, and he stored food in the strongholds.
34 Simon also chose men and sent them to Demeʹtrius the king with a request to grant relief to the country, for all that Trypho did was to plunder.
35 Demeʹtrius the king sent him a favorable reply to this request, and wrote him a letter as follows,
36 “King Demeʹtrius to Simon, the high priest and friend of kings, and to the elders and nation of the Jews, greeting.
37 We have received the gold crown and the palm branch which you sent, and we are ready to make a general peace with you and to write to our officials to grant you release from tribute.
38 All the grants that we have made to you remain valid, and let the strongholds that you have built be your possession.
39 We pardon any errors and offenses committed to this day, and cancel the crown tax which you owe; and whatever other tax has been collected in Jerusalem shall be collected no longer.
40 And if any of you are qualified to be enrolled in our bodyguard, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.”
41 In the one hundred and seventieth year the yoke of the Gentiles was removed from Israel,
42 and the people began to write in their documents and contracts, “In the first year of Simon the great high priest and commander and leader of the Jews.”
### The Capture of Gazara by Simon
43 In those days Simon encamped against Gazarʹa and surrounded it with troops. He made a siege engine, brought it up to the city, and battered and captured one tower.
44 The men in the siege engine leaped out into the city, and a great tumult arose in the city.
45 The men in the city, with their wives and children, went up on the wall with their clothes rent, and they cried out with a loud voice, asking Simon to make peace with them;
46 they said, “Do not treat us according to our wicked acts but according to your mercy.”
47 So Simon reached an agreement with them and stopped fighting against them. But he expelled them from the city and cleansed the houses in which the idols were, and then entered it with hymns and praise.
48 He cast out of it all uncleanness, and settled in it men who observed the law. He also strengthened its fortifications and built in it a house for himself.
### Simon Regains the Citadel at Jerusalem
49 The men in the citadel at Jerusalem were prevented from going out to the country and back to buy and sell. So they were very hungry, and many of them perished from famine.
50 Then they cried to Simon to make peace with them, and he did so. But he expelled them from there and cleansed the citadel from its pollutions.
51 On the twenty-third day of the second month, in the one hundred and seventy-first year, the Jews entered it with praise and palm branches, and with harps and cymbals and stringed instruments, and with hymns and songs, because a great enemy had been crushed and removed from Israel.
52 And Simon decreed that every year they should celebrate this day with rejoicing. He strengthened the fortifications of the temple hill alongside the citadel, and he and his men dwelt there.
53 And Simon saw that John his son had reached manhood, so he made him commander of all the forces, and he dwelt in Gazarʹa.


# Liber Primus Machabaeorum 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et audivit Simon quod congregavit Tryphon exercitum copiosum ut veniret in terram Juda, et attereret eam.
2 Videns quia in tremore populus est, et in timore, ascendit Jerusalem, et congregavit populum:
3 et adhortans dixit: Vos scitis quanta ego, et fratres mei, et domus patris mei, fecimus pro legibus et pro sanctis, prælia, et angustias quales vidimus:
4 horum gratia perierunt fratres mei omnes propter Israël, et relictus sum ego solus.
5 Et nunc non mihi contingat parcere animæ meæ in omni tempore tribulationis: non enim melior sum fratribus meis.
6 Vindicabo itaque gentem meam, et sancta, natos quoque nostros, et uxores: quia congregatæ sunt universæ gentes conterere nos inimicitiæ gratia.
7 Et accensus est spiritus populi simul ut audivit sermones istos:
8 et responderunt voce magna, dicentes: Tu es dux noster loco Judæ, et Jonathæ fratris tui:
9 pugna prælium nostrum: et omnia, quæcumque dixeris nobis, faciemus.

10 Et congregans omnes viros bellatores, acceleravit consummare universos muros Jerusalem, et munivit eam in gyro.
11 Et misit Jonathan filium Absalomi, et cum eo exercitum novum in Joppen, et ejectis his qui erant in ea, remansit illic ipse.
12 Et movit Tryphon a Ptolemaida cum exercitu multo, ut veniret in terram Juda, et Jonathas cum eo in custodia.
13 Simon autem applicuit in Addus contra faciem campi.
14 Et ut cognovit Tryphon quia surrexit Simon loco fratris sui Jonathæ, et quia commissurus esset cum eo prælium, misit ad eum legatos,
15 dicens: Pro argento, quod debebat frater tuus Jonathas in ratione regis propter negotia quæ habuit, detinuimus eum.
16 Et nunc mitte argenti talenta centum, et duos filios ejus obsides, ut non dimissus fugiat a nobis, et remittemus eum.
17 Et cognovit Simon quia cum dolo loqueretur secum: jussit tamen dari argentum et pueros, ne inimicitiam magnam sumeret ad populum Israël, dicentem:
18 Quia non misit ei argentum, et pueros, propterea periit.
19 Et misit pueros, et centum talenta: et mentitus est, et non dimisit Jonathan.

20 Et post hæc venit Tryphon intra regionem, ut contereret eam: et gyraverunt per viam quæ ducit Ador: et Simon et castra ejus ambulabant in omnem locum quocumque ibant.
21 Qui autem in arce erant, miserunt ad Tryphonem legatos, ut festinaret venire per desertum, et mitteret illis alimonias.
22 Et paravit Tryphon omnem equitatum, ut veniret illa nocte: erat autem nix multa valde, et non venit in Galaaditim.
23 Et cum appropinquasset Bascaman, occidit Jonathan et filios ejus illic.
24 Et convertit Tryphon, et abiit in terram suam.

25 Et misit Simon, et accepit ossa Jonathæ fratris sui, et sepelivit ea in Modin civitate patrum ejus.
26 Et planxerunt eum omnis Israël planctu magno, et luxerunt eum dies multos.
27 Et ædificavit Simon super sepulchrum patris sui et fratrum suorum ædificium altum visu, lapide polito retro et ante.
28 Et statuit septem pyramidas, unam contra unam, patri et matri, et quatuor fratribus:
29 et his circumposuit columnas magnas: et super columnas arma, ad memoriam æternam: et juxta arma naves sculptas, quæ viderentur ab omnibus navigantibus mare:
30 hoc est sepulchrum, quod fecit in Modin usque in hunc diem.
31 Tryphon autem cum iter faceret cum Antiocho rege adolescente, dolo occidit eum:
32 et regnavit loco ejus, et imposuit sibi diadema Asiæ, et fecit plagam magnam in terra.

33 Et ædificavit Simon præsidia Judææ, muniens ea turribus excelsis, et muris magnis, et portis, et seris: et posuit alimenta in munitionibus.
34 Et elegit Simon viros, et misit ad Demetrium regem ut faceret remissionem regioni: quia actus omnes Tryphonis per direptionem fuerant gesti.
35 Et Demetrius rex ad verba ista respondit ei, et scripsit epistolam talem:
36 Rex Demetrius Simoni summo sacerdoti et amico regum, et senioribus, et genti Judæorum, salutem.
37 Coronam auream, et bahem, quam misistis, suscepimus: et parati sumus facere vobiscum pacem magnam, et scribere præpositis regis remittere vobis quæ indulsimus.
38 Quæcumque enim constituimus, vobis constant: munitiones, quas ædificastis, vobis sint:
39 remittimus quoque ignorantias et peccata usque in hodiernum diem, et coronam quam debebatis: et si quid aliud erat tributarium in Jerusalem, jam non sit tributarium.
40 Et si qui ex vobis apti sunt conscribi inter nostros, conscribantur, et sit inter nos pax.

41 Anno centesimo septuagesimo, ablatum est jugum gentium ab Israël.
42 Et cœpit populus Israël scribere in tabulis, et gestis publicis, anno primo sub Simone summo sacerdote, magno duce, et principe Judæorum.

43 In diebus illis applicuit Simon ad Gazam, et circumdedit eam castris, et fecit machinas, et applicuit ad civitatem, et percussit turrem unam, et comprehendit eam.
44 Et eruperant qui erant intra machinam in civitatem, et factus est motus magnus in civitate.
45 Et ascenderunt qui erant in civitate cum uxoribus et filiis supra murum, scissis tunicis suis, et clamaverunt voce magna, postulantes a Simone dextras sibi dari,
46 et dixerunt: Non nobis reddas secundum malitias nostras, sed secundum misericordias tuas.
47 Et flexus Simon, non debellavit eos: ejecit tamen eos de civitate, et mundavit ædes in quibus fuerant simulacra, et tunc intravit in eam cum hymnis benedicens Dominum:
48 et ejecta ab ea omni immunditia, collocavit in ea viros qui legem facerent: et munivit eam, et fecit sibi habitationem.

49 Qui autem erant in arce Jerusalem, prohibebantur egredi et ingredi regionem, et emere ac vendere: et esurierunt valde, et multi ex eis fame perierunt,
50 et clamaverunt ad Simonem ut dextras acciperent: et dedit illis: et ejecit eos inde, et mundavit arcem a contaminationibus:
51 et intraverunt in eam tertia et vigesima die secundi mensis, anno centesimo septuagesimo primo, cum laude, et ramis palmarum, et cinyris, et cymbalis, et nablis, et hymnis, et canticis, quia contritus est inimicus magnus ex Israël.
52 Et constituit ut omnibus annis agerentur dies hi cum lætitia.
53 Et munivit montem templi, qui erat secus arcem, et habitavit ibi ipse, et qui cum eo erant.
54 Et vidit Simon Joannem filium suum, quod fortis prælii vir esset: et posuit eum ducem virtutum universarum: et habitavit in Gazaris.


# Μακκαβαίων Αʹ 13 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἤκουσεν Σιμων ὅτι συνήγαγεν Τρύφων δύναμιν πολλὴν τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς γῆν Ιουδα καὶ ἐκτρῖψαι αὐτήν
2 καὶ εἶδεν τὸν λαόν ὅτι ἔντρομός ἐστιν καὶ ἔκφοβος καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἤθροισεν τὸν λαὸν
3 καὶ παρεκάλεσεν αὐτοὺς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς αὐτοὶ οἴδατε ὅσα ἐγὼ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός μου ἐποιήσαμεν περὶ τῶν νόμων καὶ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ τοὺς πολέμους καὶ τὰς στενοχωρίας ἃς εἴδομεν
4 τούτου χάριν ἀπώλοντο οἱ ἀδελφοί μου πάντες χάριν τοῦ Ισραηλ καὶ κατελείφθην ἐγὼ μόνος
5 καὶ νῦν μή μοι γένοιτο φείσασθαί μου τῆς ψυχῆς ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ θλίψεως οὐ γάρ εἰμι κρείσσων τῶν ἀδελφῶν μου
6 πλὴν ἐκδικήσω περὶ τοῦ ἔθνους μου καὶ περὶ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ περὶ τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ τέκνων ὑμῶν ὅτι συνήχθησαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἐκτρῖψαι ἡμᾶς ἔχθρας χάριν
7 καὶ ἀνεζωπύρησεν τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ λαοῦ ἅμα τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι τῶν λόγων τούτων
8 καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ λέγοντες σὺ εἶ ἡμῶν ἡγούμενος ἀντὶ Ιουδου καὶ Ιωναθου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου
9 πολέμησον τὸν πόλεμον ἡμῶν καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἂν εἴπῃς ἡμῖν ποιήσομεν

10 καὶ συνήγαγεν πάντας τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς πολεμιστὰς καὶ ἐτάχυνεν τοῦ τελέσαι τὰ τείχη Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὠχύρωσεν αὐτὴν κυκλόθεν
11 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιωναθαν τὸν τοῦ Αψαλωμου καὶ με{T'} αὐτοῦ δύναμιν ἱκανὴν εἰς Ιοππην καὶ ἐξέβαλεν τοὺς ὄντας ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ ἔμεινεν ἐκεῖ ἐν αὐτῇ
12 καὶ ἀπῆρεν Τρύφων ἀπὸ Πτολεμαίδος μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς ἐλθεῖν εἰς γῆν Ιουδα καὶ Ιωναθαν με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐν φυλακῇ
13 Σιμων δὲ παρενέβαλεν ἐν Αδιδοις κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ πεδίου
14 καὶ ἐπέγνω Τρύφων ὅτι ἀνέστη Σιμων ἀντὶ Ιωναθου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ ὅτι συνάπτειν αὐτῷ μέλλει πόλεμον καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς αὐτὸν πρέσβεις λέγων
15 περὶ ἀργυρίου οὗ ὤφειλεν Ιωναθαν ὁ ἀδελφός σου εἰς τὸ βασιλικὸν δ{I'} ἃς εἶχεν χρείας συνέχομεν αὐτόν
16 καὶ νῦν ἀπόστειλον ἀργυρίου τάλαντα ἑκατὸν καὶ δύο τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ὅμηρα ὅπως μὴ ἀφεθεὶς ἀποστατήσῃ ἀ{F'} ἡμῶν καὶ ἀφήσομεν αὐτόν
17 καὶ ἔγνω Σιμων ὅτι δόλῳ λαλοῦσιν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ πέμπει τοῦ λαβεῖν τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὰ παιδάρια μήποτε ἔχθραν ἄρῃ μεγάλην πρὸς τὸν λαὸν
18 λέγοντες ὅτι οὐκ ἀπέστειλα αὐτῷ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὰ παιδάρια ἀπώλετο
19 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τὰ παιδάρια καὶ τὰ ἑκατὸν τάλαντα καὶ διεψεύσατο καὶ οὐκ ἀφῆκεν τὸν Ιωναθαν

20 καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἦλθεν Τρύφων τοῦ ἐμβατεῦσαι εἰς τὴν χώραν καὶ ἐκτρῖψαι αὐτήν καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν ὁδὸν τὴν εἰς Αδωρα καὶ Σιμων καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ ἀντιπαρῆγεν αὐτῷ εἰς πάντα τόπον οὗ ἂν ἐπορεύετο
21 οἱ δὲ ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας ἀπέστελλον πρὸς Τρύφωνα πρεσβευτὰς κατασπεύδοντας αὐτὸν τοῦ ἐλθεῖν πρὸς αὐτοὺς διὰ τῆς ἐρήμου καὶ ἀποστεῖλαι αὐτοῖς τροφάς
22 καὶ ἡτοίμασεν Τρύφων πᾶσαν τὴν ἵππον αὐτοῦ ἐλθεῖν καὶ ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ ἦν χιὼν πολλὴ σφόδρα καὶ οὐκ ἦλθεν διὰ τὴν χιόνα καὶ ἀπῆρεν καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς τὴν Γαλααδῖτιν
23 ὡς δὲ ἤγγισεν τῆς Βασκαμα ἀπέκτεινεν τὸν Ιωναθαν καὶ ἐτάφη ἐκεῖ
24 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Τρύφων καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ

25 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σιμων καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰ ὀστᾶ Ιωναθου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθαψεν αὐτὸν ἐν Μωδεϊν πόλει τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ
26 καὶ ἐκόψαντο αὐτὸν πᾶς Ισραηλ κοπετὸν μέγαν καὶ ἐπένθησαν αὐτὸν ἡμέρας πολλάς
27 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν Σιμων ἐπὶ τὸν τάφον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ὕψωσεν αὐτὸν τῇ ὁράσει λίθῳ ξεστῷ ἐκ τῶν ὄπισθεν καὶ ἔμπροσθεν
28 καὶ ἔστησεν ἑπτὰ πυραμίδας μίαν κατέναντι τῆς μιᾶς τῷ πατρὶ καὶ τῇ μητρὶ καὶ τοῖς τέσσαρσιν ἀδελφοῖς
29 καὶ ταύταις ἐποίησεν μηχανήματα περιθεὶς στύλους μεγάλους καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐπὶ τοῖς στύλοις πανοπλίας εἰς ὄνομα αἰώνιον καὶ παρὰ ταῖς πανοπλίαις πλοῖα ἐγγεγλυμμένα εἰς τὸ θεωρεῖσθαι ὑπὸ πάντων τῶν πλεόντων τὴν θάλασσαν
30 οὗτος ὁ τάφος ὃν ἐποίησεν ἐν Μωδεϊν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
31 ὁ δὲ Τρύφων ἐπορεύετο δόλῳ μετὰ Ἀντιόχου τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ νεωτέρου καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτὸν
32 καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ περιέθετο τὸ διάδημα τῆς Ἀσίας καὶ ἐποίησεν πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς

33 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν Σιμων τὰ ὀχυρώματα τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ περιετείχισεν πύργοις ὑψηλοῖς καὶ τείχεσιν μεγάλοις καὶ πύλαις καὶ μοχλοῖς καὶ ἔθετο βρώματα ἐν τοῖς ὀχυρώμασιν
34 καὶ ἐπέλεξεν Σιμων ἄνδρας καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς Δημήτριον τὸν βασιλέα τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἄφεσιν τῇ χώρᾳ ὅτι πᾶσαι αἱ πράξεις Τρύφωνος ἦσαν ἁρπαγαί
35 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ Δημήτριος ὁ βασιλεὺς κατὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ καὶ ἔγραψεν αὐτῷ ἐπιστολὴν τοιαύτην
36 βασιλεὺς Δημήτριος Σιμωνι ἀρχιερεῖ καὶ φίλῳ βασιλέων καὶ πρεσβυτέροις καὶ ἔθνει Ιουδαίων χαίρειν
37 τὸν στέφανον τὸν χρυσοῦν καὶ τὴν βαΐνην ἣν ἀπεστείλατε κεκομίσμεθα καὶ ἕτοιμοί ἐσμεν τοῦ ποιεῖν ὑμῖν εἰρήνην μεγάλην καὶ γράφειν τοῖς ἐπὶ τῶν χρειῶν τοῦ ἀφιέναι ὑμῖν τὰ ἀφέματα
38 καὶ ὅσα ἐστήσαμεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἕστηκεν καὶ τὰ ὀχυρώματα ἃ ᾠκοδομήσατε ὑπαρχέτω ὑμῖν
39 ἀφίεμεν δὲ ἀγνοήματα καὶ τὰ ἁμαρτήματα ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας καὶ τὸν στέφανον ὃν ὠφείλετε καὶ εἴ τι ἄλλο ἐτελωνεῖτο ἐν Ιερουσαλημ μηκέτι τελωνείσθω
40 καὶ εἴ τινες ἐπιτήδειοι ὑμῶν γραφῆναι εἰς τοὺς περὶ ἡμᾶς ἐγγραφέσθωσαν καὶ γινέσθω ἀνὰ μέσον ἡμῶν εἰρήνη

41 ἔτους ἑβδομηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ ἤρθη ὁ ζυγὸς τῶν ἐθνῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ Ισραηλ
42 καὶ ἤρξατο ὁ λαὸς γράφειν ἐν ταῖς συγγραφαῖς καὶ συναλλάγμασιν ἔτους πρώτου ἐπὶ Σιμωνος ἀρχιερέως μεγάλου καὶ στρατηγοῦ καὶ ἡγουμένου Ιουδαίων

43 ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ Γαζαρα καὶ ἐκύκλωσεν αὐτὴν παρεμβολαῖς καὶ ἐποίησεν ἑλεόπολιν καὶ προσήγαγεν τῇ πόλει καὶ ἐπάταξεν πύργον ἕνα καὶ κατελάβετο
44 καὶ ἐξήλλοντο οἱ ἐν τῇ ἑλεοπόλει εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἐγένετο κίνημα μέγα ἐν τῇ πόλει
45 καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ ἐν τῇ πόλει σὺν γυναιξὶν καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ἐπὶ τὸ τεῖχος διερρηχότες τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν καὶ ἐβόησαν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ἀξιοῦντες Σιμωνα δεξιὰς αὐτοῖς δοῦναι
46 καὶ εἶπαν μὴ ἡμῖν χρήσῃ κατὰ τὰς πονηρίας ἡμῶν ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὸ ἔλεός σου
47 καὶ συνελύθη αὐτοῖς Σιμων καὶ οὐκ ἐπολέμησεν αὐτούς καὶ ἐξέβαλεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐκαθάρισεν τὰς οἰκίας ἐν αἷς ἦν τὰ εἴδωλα καὶ οὕτως εἰσῆλθεν εἰς αὐτὴν ὑμνῶν καὶ εὐλογῶν
48 καὶ ἐξέβαλεν ἐξ αὐτῆς πᾶσαν ἀκαθαρσίαν καὶ κατῴκισεν ἐν αὐτῇ ἄνδρας οἵτινες τὸν νόμον ποιήσωσιν καὶ προσωχύρωσεν αὐτὴν καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἑαυτῷ ἐν αὐτῇ οἴκησιν

49 οἱ δὲ ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἐκωλύοντο ἐκπορεύεσθαι καὶ εἰσπορεύεσθαι εἰς τὴν χώραν ἀγοράζειν καὶ πωλεῖν καὶ ἐπείνασαν σφόδρα καὶ ἀπώλοντο ἐξ αὐτῶν ἱκανοὶ τῷ λιμῷ
50 καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς Σιμωνα δεξιὰς λαβεῖν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐξέβαλεν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖθεν καὶ ἐκαθάρισεν τὴν ἄκραν ἀπὸ τῶν μιασμάτων
51 καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς αὐτὴν τῇ τρίτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ δευτέρου μηνὸς ἔτους πρώτου καὶ ἑβδομηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ μετὰ αἰνέσεως καὶ βαΐων καὶ ἐν κινύραις καὶ ἐν κυμβάλοις καὶ ἐν νάβλαις καὶ ἐν ὕμνοις καὶ ἐν ᾠδαῖς ὅτι συνετρίβη ἐχθρὸς μέγας ἐξ Ισραηλ
52 καὶ ἔστησεν κα{T'} ἐνιαυτὸν τοῦ ἄγειν τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην μετὰ εὐφροσύνης
53 καὶ προσωχύρωσεν τὸ ὄρος τοῦ ἱεροῦ τὸ παρὰ τὴν ἄκραν καὶ ᾤκει ἐκεῖ αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πα{R'} αὐτοῦ
54 καὶ εἶδεν Σιμων τὸν Ιωαννην υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἀνήρ ἐστιν καὶ ἔθετο αὐτὸν ἡγούμενον τῶν δυνάμεων πασῶν καὶ ᾤκει ἐν Γαζαροις
