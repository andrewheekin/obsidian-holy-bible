# First Book of Maccabees 7 (RSVCE)

### Expedition of Bacchides and Alcimus
1 In the one hundred and fifty-first year Demeʹtrius the son of Seleuʹcus set forth from Rome, sailed with a few men to a city by the sea, and there began to reign.
2 As he was entering the royal palace of his fathers, the army seized Antiʹochus and Lysʹias to bring them to him.
3 But when this act became known to him, he said, “Do not let me see their faces!”
4 So the army killed them, and Demeʹtrius took his seat upon the throne of his kingdom.
5 Then there came to him all the lawless and ungodly men of Israel; they were led by Alʹcimus, who wanted to be high priest.
6 And they brought to the king this accusation against the people: “Judas and his brothers have destroyed all your friends, and have driven us out of our land.
7 Now then send a man whom you trust; let him go and see all the ruin which Judas has brought upon us and upon the land of the king, and let him punish them and all who help them.”
8 So the king chose Bacʹchides, one of the king’s friends, governor of the province Beyond the River; he was a great man in the kingdom and was faithful to the king.
9 And he sent him, and with him the ungodly Alʹcimus, whom he made high priest; and he commanded him to take vengeance on the sons of Israel.
10 So they marched away and came with a large force into the land of Judah; and he sent messengers to Judas and his brothers with peaceable but treacherous words.
11 But they paid no attention to their words, for they saw that they had come with a large force.
12 Then a group of scribes appeared in a body before Alʹcimus and Bacʹchides to ask for just terms.
13 The Hasideʹans were first among the sons of Israel to seek peace from them,
14 for they said, “A priest of the line of Aaron has come with the army, and he will not harm us.”
15 And he spoke peaceable words to them and swore this oath to them, “We will not seek to injure you or your friends.”
16 So they trusted him; but he seized sixty of them and killed them in one day, in accordance with the word which was written,
17 “The flesh of thy saints and their blood they poured out round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.”
18 Then the fear and dread of them fell upon all the people, for they said, “There is no truth or justice in them, for they have violated the agreement and the oath which they swore.”
19 Then Bacʹchides departed from Jerusalem and encamped in Beth-zaith. And he sent and seized many of the men who had deserted to him, and some of the people, and killed them and threw them into the great pit.
20 He placed Alʹcimus in charge of the country and left with him a force to help him; then Bacʹchides went back to the king.
21 Alʹcimus strove for the high priesthood,
22 and all who were troubling their people joined him. They gained control of the land of Judah and did great damage in Israel.
23 And Judas saw all the evil that Alʹcimus and those with him had done among the sons of Israel; it was more than the Gentiles had done.
24 So Judas went out into all the surrounding parts of Judea, and took vengeance on the men who had deserted, and he prevented those in the city from going out into the country.
25 When Alʹcimus saw that Judas and those with him had grown strong, and realized that he could not withstand them, he returned to the king and brought wicked charges against them.
### Nicanor in Judea
26 Then the king sent Nicaʹnor, one of his honored princes, who hated and detested Israel, and he commanded him to destroy the people.
27 So Nicaʹnor came to Jerusalem with a large force, and treacherously sent to Judas and his brothers this peaceable message,
28 “Let there be no fighting between me and you; I shall come with a few men to see you face to face in peace.”
29 So he came to Judas, and they greeted one another peaceably. But the enemy were ready to seize Judas.
30 It became known to Judas that Nicaʹnor had come to him with treacherous intent, and he was afraid of him and would not meet him again.
31 When Nicaʹnor learned that his plan had been disclosed, he went out to meet Judas in battle near Capharsalʹama.
32 About five hundred men of the army of Nicaʹnor fell, and the rest fled into the city of David.
### Nicanor Threatens the Temple
33 After these events Nicaʹnor went up to Mount Zion. Some of the priests came out of the sanctuary, and some of the elders of the people, to greet him peaceably and to show him the burnt offering that was being offered for the king.
34 But he mocked them and derided them and defiled them and spoke arrogantly,
35 and in anger he swore this oath, “Unless Judas and his army are delivered into my hands this time, then if I return safely I will burn up this house.” And he went out in great anger.
36 Then the priests went in and stood before the altar and the temple, and they wept and said,
37 “Thou didst choose this house to be called by thy name, and to be for thy people a house of prayer and supplication.
38 Take vengeance on this man and on his army, and let them fall by the sword; remember their blasphemies, and let them live no longer.”
### The Death of Nicanor
39 Now Nicaʹnor went out from Jerusalem and encamped in Beth-horʹon, and the Syrian army joined him.
40 And Judas encamped in Adʹasa with three thousand men. Then Judas prayed and said,
41 “When the messengers from the king spoke blasphemy, thy angel went forth and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand of the Assyrians.
42 So also crush this army before us today; let the rest learn that Nicaʹnor has spoken wickedly against thy sanctuary, and judge him according to this wickedness.”
43 So the armies met in battle on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. The army of Nicaʹnor was crushed, and he himself was the first to fall in the battle.
44 When his army saw that Nicaʹnor had fallen, they threw down their arms and fled.
45 The Jews pursued them a day’s journey, from Adʹasa as far as Gazarʹa, and as they followed kept sounding the battle call on the trumpets.
46 And men came out of all the villages of Judea round about, and they out-flanked the enemy and drove them back to their pursuers, so that they all fell by the sword; not even one of them was left.
47 Then the Jews seized the spoils and the plunder, and they cut off Nicaʹnor’s head and the right hand which he had so arrogantly stretched out, and brought them and displayed them just outside Jerusalem.
48 The people rejoiced greatly and celebrated that day as a day of great gladness.
49 And they decreed that this day should be celebrated each year on the thirteenth day of Adar.
50 So the land of Judah had rest for a few days.


# Liber Primus Machabaeorum 7 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno centesimo quinquagesimo primo, exiit Demetrius Seleuci filius ab urbe Roma, et ascendit cum paucis viris in civitatem maritimam, et regnavit illic.
2 Et factum est, ut ingressus est domum regni patrum suorum, comprehendit exercitus Antiochum et Lysiam, ut adducerent eos ad eum.
3 Et res ei innotuit, et ait: Nolite mihi ostendere faciem eorum.
4 Et occidit eos exercitus. Et sedit Demetrius super sedem regni sui.

5 Et venerunt ad eum viri iniqui et impii ex Israël: et Alcimus dux eorum, qui volebat fieri sacerdos.
6 Et accusaverunt populum apud regem, dicentes: Perdidit Judas et fratres ejus omnes amicos tuos, et nos dispersit de terra nostra.
7 Nunc ergo mitte virum, cui credis, ut eat, et videat exterminium omne quod fecit nobis, et regionibus regis: et puniat omnes amicos ejus, et adjutores eorum.
8 Et elegit rex ex amicis suis Bacchidem, qui dominabatur trans flumen magnum in regno, et fidelem regi: et misit eum,
9 ut videret exterminium quod fecit Judas: sed et Alcimum impium constituit in sacerdotium, et mandavit ei facere ultionem in filios Israël.

10 Et surrexerunt, et venerunt cum exercitu magno in terram Juda: et miserunt nuntios, et locuti sunt ad Judam et ad fratres ejus verbis pacificis in dolo.
11 Et non intenderunt sermonibus eorum: viderunt enim quia venerunt cum exercitu magno.
12 Et convenerunt ad Alcimum et Bacchidem congregatio scribarum requirere quæ justa sunt:
13 et primi, Assidæi qui erant in filiis Israël: et exquirebant ab eis pacem.
14 Dixerunt enim: Homo sacerdos de semine Aaron venit; non decipiet nos:
15 et locutus est cum eis verba pacifica, et juravit illis, dicens: Non inferemus vobis malum, neque amicis vestris.
16 Et crediderunt ei: et comprehendit ex eis sexaginta viros, et occidit eos in una die, secundum verbum quod scriptum est:
17 Carnes sanctorum tuorum, et sanguinem ipsorum effuderunt in circuitu Jerusalem, et non erat qui sepeliret.
18 Et incubuit timor et tremor in omnem populum: quia dixerunt: Non est veritas, et judicium in eis: transgressi sunt enim constitutum, et jusjurandum quod juraverunt.
19 Et movit Bacchides castra ab Jerusalem, et applicuit in Bethzecha: et misit, et comprehendit multos ex eis qui a se effugerant: et quosdam de populo mactavit, et in puteum magnum projecit.
20 Et commisit regionem Alcimo, et reliquit cum eo auxilium in adjutorium ipsi. Et abiit Bacchides ad regem:
21 et satis agebat Alcimus pro principatu sacerdotii sui:
22 et convenerunt ad eum omnes, qui perturbabant populum suum, et obtinuerunt terram Juda, et fecerunt plagam magnam in Israël.

23 Et vidit Judas omnia mala quæ fecit Alcimus et qui cum eo erant filiis Israël, multo plus quam gentes:
24 et exiit in omnes fines Judææ in circuitu, et fecit vindictam in viros desertores, et cessaverunt ultra exire in regionem.
25 Vidit autem Alcimus quod prævaluit Judas et qui cum eo erant, et cognovit quia non potest sustinere eos: et regressus est ad regem, et accusavit eos multis criminibus.
26 Et misit rex Nicanorem, unum ex principibus suis nobilioribus, qui erat inimicitias exercens contra Israël: et mandavit ei evertere populum.
27 Et venit Nicanor in Jerusalem cum exercitu magno, et misit ad Judam et ad fratres ejus verbis pacificis cum dolo,
28 dicens: Non sit pugna inter me et vos: veniam cum viris paucis, ut videam facies vestras cum pace.
29 Et venit ad Judam, et salutaverunt se invicem pacifice: et hostes parati erant rapere Judam.
30 Et innotuit sermo Judæ quoniam cum dolo venerat ad eum: et conterritus est ab eo, et amplius noluit videre faciem ejus.

31 Et cognovit Nicanor quoniam denudatum est consilium ejus: et exivit obviam Judæ in pugnam juxta Capharsalama.
32 Et ceciderunt de Nicanoris exercitu fere quinque millia viri, et fugerunt in civitatem David.
33 Et post hæc verba ascendit Nicanor in montem Sion: et exierunt de sacerdotibus populi salutare eum in pace, et demonstrare ei holocautomata, quæ offerebantur pro rege.
34 Et irridens sprevit eos, et polluit: et locutus est superbe,
35 et juravit cum ira, dicens: Nisi traditus fuerit Judas et exercitus ejus in manus meas, continuo cum regressus fuero in pace, succendam domum istam. Et exiit cum ira magna.
36 Et intraverunt sacerdotes, et steterunt ante faciem altaris et templi, et flentes dixerunt:
37 Tu, Domine, elegisti domum istam ad invocandum nomen tuum in ea, ut esset domus orationis et obsecrationis populo tuo:
38 fac vindictam in homine isto et exercitu ejus, et cadant in gladio: memento blasphemias eorum, et ne dederis eis ut permaneant.

39 Et exiit Nicanor ab Jerusalem, et castra applicuit ad Bethoron: et occurrit illi exercitus Syriæ.
40 Et Judas applicuit in Adarsa cum tribus millibus viris: et oravit Judas, et dixit:
41 Qui missi erant a rege Sennacherib, Domine, quia blasphemaverunt te, exiit angelus, et percussit ex eis centum octoginta quinque millia:
42 sic contere exercitum istum in conspectu nostro hodie: et sciant ceteri quia male locutus est super sancta tua: et judica illum secundum malitiam illius.

43 Et commiserunt exercitus prælium tertiadecima die mensis Adar: et contrita sunt castra Nicanoris, et cecidit ipse primus in prælio.
44 Ut autem vidit exercitus ejus quia cecidisset Nicanor, projecerunt arma sua, et fugerunt:
45 et persecuti sunt eos viam unius diei ab Adazer usquequo veniatur in Gazara, et tubis cecinerunt post eos cum significationibus:
46 et exierunt de omnibus castellis Judææ in circuitu, et ventilabant eos cornibus, et convertebantur iterum ad eos, et ceciderunt omnes gladio, et non est relictus ex eis nec unus.
47 Et acceperunt spolia eorum in prædam: et caput Nicanoris amputaverunt, et dexteram ejus, quam extenderat superbe, et attulerunt, et suspenderunt contra Jerusalem.
48 Et lætatus est populus valde, et egerunt diem illam in lætitia magna.
49 Et constituit agi omnibus annis diem istam tertiadecima die mensis Adar.
50 Et siluit terra Juda dies paucos.


# Μακκαβαίων Αʹ 7 (Septuagint)

1 ἔτους ἑνὸς καὶ πεντηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ ἐξῆλθεν Δημήτριος ὁ τοῦ Σελεύκου ἐκ Ῥώμης καὶ ἀνέβη σὺν ἀνδράσιν ὀλίγοις εἰς πόλιν παραθαλασσίαν καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐκεῖ
2 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἰσεπορεύετο εἰς οἶκον βασιλείας πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ συνέλαβον αἱ δυνάμεις τὸν Ἀντίοχον καὶ τὸν Λυσίαν ἀγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς αὐτῷ
3 καὶ ἐγνώσθη αὐτῷ τὸ πρᾶγμα καὶ εἶπεν μή μοι δείξητε τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν
4 καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτοὺς αἱ δυνάμεις καὶ ἐκάθισεν Δημήτριος ἐπὶ θρόνου βασιλείας αὐτοῦ

5 καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες ἄνδρες ἄνομοι καὶ ἀσεβεῖς ἐξ Ισραηλ καὶ Ἄλκιμος ἡγεῖτο αὐτῶν βουλόμενος ἱερατεύειν
6 καὶ κατηγόρησαν τοῦ λαοῦ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα λέγοντες ἀπώλεσεν Ιουδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ πάντας τοὺς φίλους σου καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐσκόρπισεν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἡμῶν
7 νῦν οὖν ἀπόστειλον ἄνδρα ᾧ πιστεύεις καὶ πορευθεὶς ἰδέτω τὴν ἐξολέθρευσιν πᾶσαν ἣν ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν καὶ τῇ χώρᾳ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ κολασάτω αὐτοὺς καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐπιβοηθοῦντας αὐτοῖς
8 καὶ ἐπέλεξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Βακχίδην τῶν φίλων τοῦ βασιλέως κυριεύοντα ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ μέγαν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ καὶ πιστὸν τῷ βασιλεῖ
9 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν καὶ Ἄλκιμον τὸν ἀσεβῆ καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτῷ τὴν ἱερωσύνην καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ποιῆσαι τὴν ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ

10 καὶ ἀπῇρον καὶ ἦλθον μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς εἰς γῆν Ιουδα καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Ιουδαν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς μετὰ δόλου
11 καὶ οὐ προσέσχον τοῖς λόγοις αὐτῶν εἶδον γὰρ ὅτι ἦλθαν μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς
12 καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν πρὸς Ἄλκιμον καὶ Βακχίδην συναγωγὴ γραμματέων ἐκζητῆσαι δίκαια
13 καὶ πρῶτοι οἱ Ασιδαῖοι ἦσαν ἐν υἱοῖς Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπεζήτουν πα{R'} αὐτῶν εἰρήνην
14 εἶπον γάρ ἄνθρωπος ἱερεὺς ἐκ σπέρματος Ααρων ἦλθεν ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσιν καὶ οὐκ ἀδικήσει ἡμᾶς
15 καὶ ἐλάλησεν με{T'} αὐτῶν λόγους εἰρηνικοὺς καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς λέγων οὐκ ἐκζητήσομεν ὑμῖν κακὸν καὶ τοῖς φίλοις ὑμῶν
16 καὶ ἐνεπίστευσαν αὐτῷ καὶ συνέλαβεν ἐξ αὐτῶν ἑξήκοντα ἄνδρας καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ κατὰ τὸν λόγον ὃν ἔγραψεν αὐτόν
17 σάρκας ὁσίων σου καὶ αἷμα αὐτῶν ἐξέχεαν κύκλῳ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς ὁ θάπτων
18 καὶ ἐπέπεσεν αὐτῶν ὁ φόβος καὶ ὁ τρόμος εἰς πάντα τὸν λαόν ὅτι εἶπον οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἀλήθεια καὶ κρίσις παρέβησαν γὰρ τὴν στάσιν καὶ τὸν ὅρκον ὃν ὤμοσαν
19 καὶ ἀπῆρεν Βακχίδης ἀπὸ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐν Βηθζαιθ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν καὶ συνέλαβεν πολλοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν με{T'} αὐτοῦ αὐτομολησάντων ἀνδρῶν καί τινας τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ἔθυσεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ φρέαρ τὸ μέγα
20 καὶ κατέστησεν τὴν χώραν τῷ Ἀλκίμῳ καὶ ἀφῆκεν με{T'} αὐτοῦ δύναμιν τοῦ βοηθεῖν αὐτῷ καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Βακχίδης πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα
21 καὶ ἠγωνίσατο Ἄλκιμος περὶ τῆς ἀρχιερωσύνης
22 καὶ συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ ταράσσοντες τὸν λαὸν αὐτῶν καὶ κατεκράτησαν γῆν Ιουδα καὶ ἐποίησαν πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐν Ισραηλ

23 καὶ εἶδεν Ιουδας πᾶσαν τὴν κακίαν ἣν ἐποίησεν Ἄλκιμος καὶ οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐν υἱοῖς Ισραηλ ὑπὲρ τὰ ἔθνη
24 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς πάντα τὰ ὅρια τῆς Ιουδαίας κυκλόθεν καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν τοῖς αὐτομολήσασιν καὶ ἀνεστάλησαν τοῦ ἐκπορεύεσθαι εἰς τὴν χώραν
25 ὡς δὲ εἶδεν Ἄλκιμος ὅτι ἐνίσχυσεν Ιουδας καὶ οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔγνω ὅτι οὐ δύναται ὑποστῆναι αὐτούς καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ κατηγόρησεν αὐτῶν πονηρά
26 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Νικάνορα ἕνα τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτοῦ τῶν ἐνδόξων καὶ μισοῦντα καὶ ἐχθραίνοντα τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ἐξᾶραι τὸν λαόν
27 καὶ ἦλθεν Νικάνωρ εἰς Ιερουσαλημ δυνάμει πολλῇ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς Ιουδαν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ μετὰ δόλου λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς λέγων
28 μὴ ἔστω μάχη ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ὑμῶν ἥξω ἐν ἀνδράσιν ὀλίγοις ἵνα ἴδω ὑμῶν τὰ πρόσωπα με{T'} εἰρήνης
29 καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς Ιουδαν καὶ ἠσπάσαντο ἀλλήλους εἰρηνικῶς καὶ οἱ πολέμιοι ἕτοιμοι ἦσαν ἐξαρπάσαι τὸν Ιουδαν
30 καὶ ἐγνώσθη ὁ λόγος τῷ Ιουδα ὅτι μετὰ δόλου ἦλθεν ἐ{P'} αὐτόν καὶ ἐπτοήθη ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐβουλήθη ἔτι ἰδεῖν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ

31 καὶ ἔγνω Νικάνωρ ὅτι ἀπεκαλύφθη ἡ βουλὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς συνάντησιν τῷ Ιουδα ἐν πολέμῳ κατὰ Χαφαρσαλαμα
32 καὶ ἔπεσον τῶν παρὰ Νικάνορος ὡσεὶ πεντακόσιοι ἄνδρες καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τὴν πόλιν Δαυιδ
33 καὶ μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἀνέβη Νικάνωρ εἰς ὄρος Σιων καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἀπὸ τῶν ἱερέων ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τοῦ λαοῦ ἀσπάσασθαι αὐτὸν εἰρηνικῶς καὶ δεῖξαι αὐτῷ τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν τὴν προσφερομένην ὑπὲρ τοῦ βασιλέως
34 καὶ ἐμυκτήρισεν αὐτοὺς καὶ κατεγέλασεν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐμίανεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐλάλησεν ὑπερηφάνως
35 καὶ ὤμοσεν μετὰ θυμοῦ λέγων ἐὰν μὴ παραδοθῇ Ιουδας καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς χεῖράς μου τὸ νῦν καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν ἐπιστρέψω ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἐμπυριῶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον καὶ ἐξῆλθεν μετὰ θυμοῦ μεγάλου
36 καὶ εἰσῆλθον οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ ἔστησαν κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ τοῦ ναοῦ καὶ ἔκλαυσαν καὶ εἶπον
37 σὺ ἐξελέξω τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐ{P'} αὐτοῦ εἶναι οἶκον προσευχῆς καὶ δεήσεως τῷ λαῷ σου
38 ποίησον ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ καὶ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ αὐτοῦ καὶ πεσέτωσαν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ μνήσθητι τῶν δυσφημιῶν αὐτῶν καὶ μὴ δῷς αὐτοῖς μονήν

39 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Νικάνωρ ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐν Βαιθωρων καὶ συνήντησεν αὐτῷ δύναμις Συρίας
40 καὶ Ιουδας παρενέβαλεν ἐν Αδασα ἐν τρισχιλίοις ἀνδράσιν καὶ προσηύξατο Ιουδας καὶ εἶπεν
41 οἱ παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως ὅτε ἐδυσφήμησαν ἐξῆλθεν ὁ ἄγγελός σου καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἑκατὸν ὀγδοήκοντα πέντε χιλιάδας
42 οὕτως σύντριψον τὴν παρεμβολὴν ταύτην ἐνώπιον ἡμῶν σήμερον καὶ γνώτωσαν οἱ ἐπίλοιποι ὅτι κακῶς ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ τὰ ἅγιά σου καὶ κρῖνον αὐτὸν κατὰ τὴν κακίαν αὐτοῦ

43 καὶ συνῆψαν αἱ παρεμβολαὶ εἰς πόλεμον τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς Αδαρ καὶ συνετρίβη ἡ παρεμβολὴ Νικάνορος καὶ ἔπεσεν αὐτὸς πρῶτος ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ
44 ὡς δὲ εἶδεν ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἔπεσεν Νικάνωρ ῥίψαντες τὰ ὅπλα ἔφυγον
45 καὶ κατεδίωκον αὐτοὺς ὁδὸν ἡμέρας μιᾶς ἀπὸ Αδασα ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς Γαζηρα καὶ ἐσάλπιζον ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ταῖς σάλπιγξιν τῶν σημασιῶν
46 καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ πασῶν τῶν κωμῶν τῆς Ιουδαίας κυκλόθεν καὶ ὑπερεκέρων αὐτούς καὶ ἀπέστρεφον οὗτοι πρὸς τούτους καὶ ἔπεσον πάντες ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ εἷς
47 καὶ ἔλαβον τὰ σκῦλα καὶ τὴν προνομήν καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Νικάνορος ἀφεῖλον καὶ τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἣν ἐξέτεινεν ὑπερηφάνως καὶ ἤνεγκαν καὶ ἐξέτειναν παρὰ τῇ Ιερουσαλημ
48 καὶ ηὐφράνθη ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα καὶ ἤγαγον τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην ἡμέραν εὐφροσύνης μεγάλην
49 καὶ ἔστησαν τοῦ ἄγειν κα{T'} ἐνιαυτὸν τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ Αδαρ
50 καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ Ιουδα ἡμέρας ὀλίγας
