# First Book of Maccabees 16 (RSVCE)

1 John went up from Gazarʹa and reported to Simon his father what Cendebeʹus had done.
2 And Simon called in his two older sons Judas and John, and said to them: “I and my brothers and the house of my father have fought the wars of Israel from our youth until this day, and things have prospered in our hands so that we have delivered Israel many times.
3 But now I have grown old, and you by His mercy are mature in years. Take my place and my brother’s, and go out and fight for our nation, and may the help which comes from Heaven be with you.”
4 So John chose out of the country twenty thousand warriors and horsemen, and they marched against Cendebeʹus and camped for the night in Moʹde-in.
5 Early in the morning they arose and marched into the plain, and behold, a large force of infantry and horsemen was coming to meet them; and a stream lay between them.
6 Then he and his army lined up against them. And he saw that the soldiers were afraid to cross the stream, so he crossed over first; and when his men saw him, they crossed over after him.
7 Then he divided the army and placed the horsemen in the midst of the infantry, for the cavalry of the enemy were very numerous.
8 And they sounded the trumpets, and Cendebeʹus and his army were put to flight, and many of them were wounded and fell; the rest fled into the stronghold.
9 At that time Judas the brother of John was wounded, but John pursued them until Cendebeʹus reached Kedron, which he had built.
10 They also fled into the towers that were in the fields of Azoʹtus, and John burned it with fire, and about two thousand of them fell. And he returned to Judea safely.
### Murder of Simon and His Sons
11 Now Ptolʹemy the son of Abuʹbus had been appointed governor over the plain of Jericho, and he had much silver and gold,
12 for he was son-in-law of the high priest.
13 His heart was lifted up; he determined to get control of the country, and made treacherous plans against Simon and his sons, to do away with them.
14 Now Simon was visiting the cities of the country and attending to their needs, and he went down to Jericho with Mattathiʹas and Judas his sons, in the one hundred and seventy-seventh year, in the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat.
15 The son of Abuʹbus received them treacherously in the little stronghold called Dok, which he had built; he gave them a great banquet, and hid men there.
16 When Simon and his sons were drunk, Ptolʹemy and his men rose up, took their weapons, and rushed in against Simon in the banquet hall, and they killed him and his two sons and some of his servants.
17 So he committed an act of great treachery and returned evil for good.
### John Succeeds Simon
18 Then Ptolʹemy wrote a report about these things and sent it to the king, asking him to send troops to aid him and to turn over to him the cities and the country.
19 He sent other men to Gazarʹa to do away with John; he sent letters to the captains asking them to come to him so that he might give them silver and gold and gifts;
20 and he sent other men to take possession of Jerusalem and the temple hill.
21 But some one ran ahead and reported to John at Gazarʹa that his father and brothers had perished, and that “he has sent men to kill you also.”
22 When he heard this, he was greatly shocked; and he seized the men who came to destroy him and killed them, for he had found out that they were seeking to destroy him.
23 The rest of the acts of John and his wars and the brave deeds which he did, and the building of the walls which he built, and his achievements,
24 behold, they are written in the chronicles of his high priesthood, from the time that he became high priest after his father.


# Liber Primus Machabaeorum 16 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et ascendit Joannes de Gazaris, et nuntiavit Simoni patri suo quæ fecit Cendebæus in populo ipsorum.
2 Et vocavit Simon duos filios seniores, Judam et Joannem, et ait illis: Ego, et fratres mei, et domus patris mei expugnavimus hostes Israël ab adolescentia usque in hunc diem: et prosperatum est in manibus nostris liberare Israël aliquoties.
3 Nunc autem senui: sed estote loco meo, et fratres mei, et egressi pugnate pro gente nostra: auxilium vero de cælo vobiscum sit.

4 Et elegit de regione viginti millia virorum belligeratorum, et equites: et profecti sunt ad Cendebæum, et dormierunt in Modin.
5 Et surrexerunt mane, et abierunt in campum: et ecce exercitus copiosus in obviam illis peditum et equitum: et fluvius torrens erat inter medium ipsorum.
6 Et admovit castra contra faciem eorum ipse et populus ejus, et vidit populum trepidantem ad transfretandum torrentem: et transfretavit primus, et viderunt eum viri, et transierunt post eum.
7 Et divisit populum et equites in medio peditum: erat autem equitatus adversariorum copiosus nimis.
8 Et exclamaverunt sacris tubis, et in fugam conversus est Cendebæus et castra ejus: et ceciderunt ex eis multi vulnerati: residui autem in munitionem fugerunt.
9 Tunc vulneratus est Judas frater Joannis: Joannes autem insecutus est eos, donec venit Cedronem, quam ædificavit:
10 et fugerunt usque ad turres, quæ erant in agris Azoti, et succendit eas igni. Et ceciderunt ex illis duo millia virorum, et reversus est in Judæam in pace.

11 Et Ptolemæus filius Abobi constitutus erat dux in campo Jericho, et habebat argentum et aurum multum:
12 erat enim gener summi sacerdotis.
13 Et exaltatum est cor ejus, et volebat obtinere regionem, et cogitabat dolum adversus Simonem et filios ejus, ut tolleret eos.
14 Simon autem, perambulans civitates quæ erant in regione Judææ, et sollicitudinem gerens earum, descendit in Jericho ipse, et Mathathias filius ejus, et Judas, anno centesimo septuagesimo septimo, mense undecimo: hic est mensis Sabath.
15 Et suscepit eos filius Abobi in munitiunculam, quæ vocatur Doch, cum dolo, quam ædificavit: et fecit eis convivium magnum, et abscondit illic viros.
16 Et cum inebriatus esset Simon et filii ejus, surrexit Ptolemæus cum suis, et sumpserunt arma sua, et intraverunt in convivium: et occiderunt eum, et duos filios ejus, et quosdam pueros ejus:
17 et fecit deceptionem magnam in Israël, et reddidit mala pro bonis.

18 Et scripsit hæc Ptolemæus, et misit regi ut mitteret ei exercitum in auxilium, et traderet ei regionem, et civitates eorum, et tributa.
19 Et misit alios in Gazaram tollere Joannem: et tribunis misit epistolas, ut venirent ad se, et daret eis argentum, et aurum, et dona.
20 Et alios misit occupare Jerusalem et montem templi.
21 Et præcurrens quidam, nuntiavit Joanni in Gazara quia periit pater ejus et fratres ejus, et quia misit te quoque interfici.
22 Ut audivit autem, vehementer expavit: et comprehendit viros, qui venerant perdere eum, et occidit eos: cognovit enim quia quærebant eum perdere.

23 Et cetera sermonum Joannis, et bellorum ejus, et bonarum virtutum, quibus fortiter gessit, et ædificii murorum, quos exstruxit, et rerum gestarum ejus:
24 ecce hæc scripta sunt in libro dierum sacerdotii ejus, ex quo factus est princeps sacerdotum post patrem suum.


# Μακκαβαίων Αʹ 16 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἀνέβη Ιωαννης ἐκ Γαζαρων καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν Σιμωνι τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ ἃ συνετέλεσεν Κενδεβαῖος
2 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Σιμων τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ιουδαν καὶ Ιωαννην καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἐγὼ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός μου ἐπολεμήσαμεν τοὺς πολέμους Ισραηλ ἀπὸ νεότητος ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας καὶ εὐοδώθη ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ἡμῶν ῥύσασθαι τὸν Ισραηλ πλεονάκις
3 νυνὶ δὲ γεγήρακα καὶ ὑμεῖς δὲ ἐν τῷ ἐλέει ἱκανοί ἐστε ἐν τοῖς ἔτεσιν γίνεσθε ἀν{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου καὶ ἐξελθόντες ὑπερμαχεῖτε ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἔθνους ἡμῶν ἡ δὲ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ βοήθεια ἔστω με{Q'} ὑμῶν

4 καὶ ἐπέλεξεν ἐκ τῆς χώρας εἴκοσι χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν πολεμιστῶν καὶ ἱππεῖς καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐπὶ τὸν Κενδεβαῖον καὶ ἐκοιμήθησαν ἐν Μωδεϊν
5 καὶ ἀναστάντες τὸ πρωὶ ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς τὸ πεδίον καὶ ἰδοὺ δύναμις πολλὴ εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς πεζικὴ καὶ ἱππεῖς καὶ χειμάρρους ἦν ἀνὰ μέσον αὐτῶν
6 καὶ παρενέβαλε κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν αὐτὸς καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶδεν τὸν λαὸν δειλούμενον διαπερᾶσαι τὸν χειμάρρουν καὶ διεπέρασεν πρῶτος καὶ εἶδον αὐτὸν οἱ ἄνδρες καὶ διεπέρασαν κατόπισθεν αὐτοῦ
7 καὶ διεῖλεν τὸν λαὸν καὶ τοὺς ἱππεῖς ἐν μέσῳ τῶν πεζῶν ἦν δὲ ἵππος τῶν ὑπεναντίων πολλὴ σφόδρα
8 καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ταῖς σάλπιγξιν καὶ ἐτροπώθη Κενδεβαῖος καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔπεσον ἐξ αὐτῶν τραυματίαι πολλοί οἱ δὲ καταλειφθέντες ἔφυγον εἰς τὸ ὀχύρωμα
9 τότε ἐτραυματίσθη Ιουδας ὁ ἀδελφὸς Ιωαννου Ιωαννης δὲ κατεδίωξεν αὐτούς ἕως ἦλθεν εἰς Κεδρων ἣν ᾠκοδόμησεν
10 καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τοὺς πύργους τοὺς ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς Ἀζώτου καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί καὶ ἔπεσον ἐξ αὐτῶν εἰς ἄνδρας δισχιλίους καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς τὴν Ιουδαίαν μετὰ εἰρήνης

11 καὶ Πτολεμαῖος ὁ τοῦ Ἀβούβου ἦν καθεσταμένος στρατηγὸς εἰς τὸ πεδίον Ιεριχω καὶ ἔσχεν ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον πολύ
12 ἦν γὰρ γαμβρὸς τοῦ ἀρχιερέως
13 καὶ ὑψώθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐβουλήθη κατακρατῆσαι τῆς χώρας καὶ ἐβουλεύετο δόλῳ κατὰ Σιμωνος καὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ἆραι αὐτούς
14 Σιμων δὲ ἦν ἐφοδεύων τὰς πόλεις τὰς ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ καὶ φροντίζων τῆς ἐπιμελείας αὐτῶν καὶ κατέβη εἰς Ιεριχω αὐτὸς καὶ Ματταθιας καὶ Ιουδας οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἔτους ἑβδόμου καὶ ἑβδομηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ ἐν μηνὶ ἑνδεκάτῳ οὗτος ὁ μὴν Σαβατ
15 καὶ ὑπεδέξατο αὐτοὺς ὁ τοῦ Ἀβούβου εἰς τὸ ὀχυρωμάτιον τὸ καλούμενον Δωκ μετὰ δόλου ὃ ᾠκοδόμησεν καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς πότον μέγαν καὶ ἐνέκρυψεν ἐκεῖ ἄνδρας
16 καὶ ὅτε ἐμεθύσθη Σιμων καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐξανέστη Πτολεμαῖος καὶ οἱ πα{R'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβον τὰ ὅπλα αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπεισῆλθον τῷ Σιμωνι εἰς τὸ συμπόσιον καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτὸν καὶ τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καί τινας τῶν παιδαρίων αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ ἐποίησεν ἀθεσίαν μεγάλην καὶ ἀπέδωκεν κακὰ ἀντὶ ἀγαθῶν

18 καὶ ἔγραψεν ταῦτα Πτολεμαῖος καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τῷ βασιλεῖ ὅπως ἀποστείλῃ αὐτῷ δυνάμεις εἰς βοήθειαν καὶ παραδῷ τὴν χώραν αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς πόλεις
19 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἑτέρους εἰς Γαζαρα ἆραι τὸν Ιωαννην καὶ τοῖς χιλιάρχοις ἀπέστειλεν ἐπιστολὰς παραγενέσθαι πρὸς αὐτόν ὅπως δῷ αὐτοῖς ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ δόματα
20 καὶ ἑτέρους ἀπέστειλεν καταλαβέσθαι τὴν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τὸ ὄρος τοῦ ἱεροῦ
21 καὶ προδραμών τις ἀπήγγειλεν Ιωαννη εἰς Γαζαρα ὅτι ἀπώλετο ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ὅτι ἀπέσταλκεν καὶ σὲ ἀποκτεῖναι
22 καὶ ἀκούσας ἐξέστη σφόδρα καὶ συνέλαβεν τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς ἐλθόντας ἀπολέσαι αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτούς ἐπέγνω γὰρ ὅτι ἐζήτουν αὐτὸν ἀπολέσαι

23 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ιωαννου καὶ τῶν πολέμων αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν ἀνδραγαθιῶν αὐτοῦ ὧν ἠνδραγάθησεν καὶ τῆς οἰκοδομῆς τῶν τειχῶν ὧν ᾠκοδόμησεν καὶ τῶν πράξεων αὐτοῦ
24 ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γέγραπται ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ ἡμερῶν ἀρχιερωσύνης αὐτοῦ ἀ{F'} οὗ ἐγενήθη ἀρχιερεὺς μετὰ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ
