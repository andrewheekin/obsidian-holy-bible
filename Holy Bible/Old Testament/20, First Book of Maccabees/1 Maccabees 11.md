# First Book of Maccabees 11 (RSVCE)

### Ptolemy Invades Syria
1 Then the king of Egypt gathered great forces, like the sand by the seashore, and many ships; and he tried to get possession of Alexander’s kingdom by trickery and add it to his own kingdom.
2 He set out for Syria with peaceable words, and the people of the cities opened their gates to him and went to meet him, for Alexander the king had commanded them to meet him, since he was Alexander’s father-in-law.
3 But when Ptolʹemy entered the cities he stationed forces as a garrison in each city.
4 When he approached Azoʹtus, they showed him the temple of Dagon burned down, and Azoʹtus and its suburbs destroyed, and the corpses lying about, and the charred bodies of those whom Jonathan had burned in the war, for they had piled them in heaps along his route.
5 They also told the king what Jonathan had done, to throw blame on him; but the king kept silent.
6 Jonathan met the king at Joppa with pomp, and they greeted one another and spent the night there.
7 And Jonathan went with the king as far as the river called Eleuʹtherus; then he returned to Jerusalem.
8 So King Ptolʹemy gained control of the coastal cities as far as Seleuʹcia by the sea, and he kept devising evil designs against Alexander.
9 He sent envoys to Demeʹtrius the king, saying, “Come, let us make a covenant with each other, and I will give you in marriage my daughter who was Alexander’s wife, and you shall reign over your father’s kingdom.
10 For I now regret that I gave him my daughter, for he has tried to kill me.”
11 He threw blame on Alexander because he coveted his kingdom.
12 So he took his daughter away from him and gave her to Demeʹtrius. He was estranged from Alexander, and their enmity became manifest.
13 Then Ptolʹemy entered Antioch and put on the crown of Asia. Thus he put two crowns upon his head, the crown of Egypt and that of Asia.
14 Now Alexander the king was in Ciliʹcia at that time, because the people of that region were in revolt.
15 And Alexander heard of it and came against him in battle. Ptolʹemy marched out and met him with a strong force, and put him to flight.
16 So Alexander fled into Arabia to find protection there, and King Ptolʹemy was exalted.
17 And Zabʹdiel the Arab cut off the head of Alexander and sent it to Ptolʹemy.
18 But King Ptolʹemy died three days later, and his troops in the strongholds were killed by the inhabitants of the strongholds.
19 So Demeʹtrius became king in the one hundred and sixty-seventh year.
### Jonathan’s Diplomacy
20 In those days Jonathan assembled the men of Judea to attack the citadel in Jerusalem, and he built many engines of war to use against it.
21 But certain lawless men who hated their nation went to the king and reported to him that Jonathan was besieging the citadel.
22 When he heard this he was angry, and as soon as he heard it he set out and came to Ptolemaʹis; and he wrote Jonathan not to continue the siege, but to meet him for a conference at Ptolemaʹis as quickly as possible.
23 When Jonathan heard this, he gave orders to continue the siege; and he chose some of the elders of Israel and some of the priests, and put himself in danger,
24 for he went to the king at Ptolemaʹis, taking silver and gold and clothing and numerous other gifts. And he won his favor.
25 Although certain lawless men of his nation kept making complaints against him,
26 the king treated him as his predecessors had treated him; he exalted him in the presence of all his friends.
27 He confirmed him in the high priesthood and in as many other honors as he had formerly had, and made him to be regarded as one of his chief friends.
28 Then Jonathan asked the king to free Judea and the three districts of Samarʹia from tribute, and promised him three hundred talents.
29 The king consented, and wrote a letter to Jonathan about all these things; its contents were as follows:
30 “King Demeʹtrius to Jonathan his brother and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.
31 This copy of the letter which we wrote concerning you to Lasʹthenes our kinsman we have written to you also, so that you may know what it says.
32 ‘King Demeʹtrius to Lasʹthenes his father, greeting.
33 To the nation of the Jews, who are our friends and fulfil their obligations to us, we have determined to do good, because of the good will they show toward us.
34 We have confirmed as their possession both the territory of Judea and the three districts of Aphairʹema and Lydda and Rathʹamin; the latter, with all the region bordering them, were added to Judea from Samarʹia. To all those who offer sacrifice in Jerusalem, we have granted release from the royal taxes which the king formerly received from them each year, from the crops of the land and the fruit of the trees.
35 And the other payments henceforth due to us of the tithes, and the taxes due to us, and the salt pits and the crown taxes due to us—from all these we shall grant them release.
36 And not one of these grants shall be canceled from this time forth for ever.
37 Now therefore take care to make a copy of this, and let it be given to Jonathan and put up in a conspicuous place on the holy mountain.’ ”
### The Intrigue of Trypho
38 Now when Demeʹtrius the king saw that the land was quiet before him and that there was no opposition to him, he dismissed all his troops, each man to his own place, except the foreign troops which he had recruited from the islands of the nations. So all the troops who had served his fathers hated him.
39 Now Trypho had formerly been one of Alexander’s supporters. He saw that all the troops were murmuring against Demeʹtrius. So he went to Imalkuʹe the Arab, who was bringing up Antiʹochus, the young son of Alexander,
40 and insistently urged him to hand Antiʹochus over to him, to become king in place of his father. He also reported to Imalkuʹe what Demeʹtrius had done and told of the hatred which the troops of Demeʹtrius had for him; and he stayed there many days.
41 Now Jonathan sent to Demeʹtrius the king the request that he remove the troops of the citadel from Jerusalem, and the troops in the strongholds; for they kept fighting against Israel.
42 And Demeʹtrius sent this message to Jonathan, “Not only will I do these things for you and your nation, but I will confer great honor on you and your nation, if I find an opportunity.
43 Now then you will do well to send me men who will help me, for all my troops have revolted.”
44 So Jonathan sent three thousand stalwart men to him at Antioch, and when they came to the king, the king rejoiced at their arrival.
45 Then the men of the city assembled within the city, to the number of a hundred and twenty thousand, and they wanted to kill the king.
46 But the king fled into the palace. Then the men of the city seized the main streets of the city and began to fight.
47 So the king called the Jews to his aid, and they all rallied about him and then spread out through the city; and they killed on that day as many as a hundred thousand men.
48 They set fire to the city and seized much spoil on that day, and they saved the king.
49 When the men of the city saw that the Jews had gained control of the city as they pleased, their courage failed and they cried out to the king with this entreaty,
50 “Grant us peace, and make the Jews stop fighting against us and our city.”
51 And they threw down their arms and made peace. So the Jews gained glory in the eyes of the king and of all the people in his kingdom, and they returned to Jerusalem with much spoil.
52 So Demeʹtrius the king sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.
53 But he broke his word about all that he had promised; and he became estranged from Jonathan and did not repay the favors which Jonathan had done him, but oppressed him greatly.
### Trypho Seizes Power
54 After this Trypho returned, and with him the young boy Antiʹochus, who began to reign and put on the crown.
55 All the troops that Demeʹtrius had cast off gathered around him, and they fought against Demeʹtrius, and he fled and was routed.
56 And Trypho captured the elephants and gained control of Antioch.
57 Then the young Antiʹochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, “I confirm you in the high priesthood and set you over the four districts and make you one of the friends of the king.”
58 And he sent him gold plate and a table service, and granted him the right to drink from gold cups and dress in purple and wear a gold buckle.
59 Simon his brother he made governor from the Ladder of Tyre to the borders of Egypt.
### Campaigns of Jonathan and Simon
60 Then Jonathan set forth and traveled beyond the river and among the cities, and all the army of Syria gathered to him as allies. When he came to Asʹkalon, the people of the city met him and paid him honor.
61 From there he departed to Gaza, but the men of Gaza shut him out. So he besieged it and burned its suburbs with fire and plundered them.
62 Then the people of Gaza pleaded with Jonathan, and he made peace with them, and took the sons of their rulers as hostages and sent them to Jerusalem. And he passed through the country as far as Damasʹcus.
63 Then Jonathan heard that the officers of Demeʹtrius had come to Kadesh in Galilee with a large army, intending to remove him from office.
64 He went to meet them, but left his brother Simon in the country.
65 Simon encamped before Beth-zur and fought against it for many days and hemmed it in.
66 Then they asked him to grant them terms of peace, and he did so. He removed them from there, took possession of the city, and set a garrison over it.
67 Jonathan and his army encamped by the waters of Gennesʹaret. Early in the morning they marched to the plain of Hazor,
68 and behold, the army of the foreigners met him in the plain; they had set an ambush against him in the mountains, but they themselves met him face to face.
69 Then the men in ambush emerged from their places and joined battle.
70 All the men with Jonathan fled; not one of them was left except Mattathiʹas the son of Abʹsalom and Judas the son of Chalphi, commanders of the forces of the army.
71 Jonathan rent his garments and put dust on his head, and prayed.
72 Then he turned back to the battle against the enemy and routed them, and they fled.
73 When his men who were fleeing saw this, they returned to him and joined him in the pursuit as far as Kadesh, to their camp, and there they encamped.
74 As many as three thousand of the foreigners fell that day. And Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.


# Liber Primus Machabaeorum 11 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et rex Ægypti congregavit exercitum, sicut arena quæ est circa oram maris, et naves multas: et quærebat obtinere regnum Alexandri dolo, et addere illud regno suo.
2 Et exiit in Syriam verbis pacificis, et aperiebant ei civitates, et occurrebant ei: quia mandaverat Alexander rex exire ei obviam, eo quod socer suus esset.
3 Cum autem introiret civitatem Ptolemæus, ponebat custodias militum in singulis civitatibus.
4 Et ut appropiavit Azoto, ostenderunt ei templum Dagon succensum igni, et Azotum, et cetera ejus demolita, et corpora projecta, et eorum, qui cæsi erant in bello, tumulos quos fecerant secus viam.
5 Et narraverunt regi quia hæc fecit Jonathas, ut invidiam facerent ei: et tacuit rex.
6 Et occurrit Jonathas regi in Joppen cum gloria, et invicem se salutaverunt, et dormierunt illic.
7 Et abiit Jonathas cum rege usque ad fluvium qui vocatur Eleutherus: et reversus est in Jerusalem.

8 Rex autem Ptolemæus obtinuit dominium civitatum usque Seleuciam maritimam, et cogitabat in Alexandrum consilia mala.
9 Et misit legatos ad Demetrium, dicens: Veni, componamus inter nos pactum, et dabo tibi filiam meam, quam habet Alexander, et regnabis in regno patris tui:
10 pœnitet enim me quod dederim illi filiam meam: quæsivit enim me occidere.
11 Et vituperavit eum, propterea quod concupierat regnum ejus.
12 Et abstulit filiam suam, et dedit eam Demetrio, et alienavit se ab Alexandro, et manifestæ sunt inimicitiæ ejus.
13 Et intravit Ptolemæus Antiochiam, et imposuit duo diademata capiti suo, Ægypti et Asiæ.
14 Alexander autem rex erat in Cilicia illis temporibus: quia rebellabant qui erant in locis illis.
15 Et audivit Alexander, et venit ad eum in bellum: et produxit Ptolemæus rex exercitum, et occurrit ei in manu valida, et fugavit eum.
16 Et fugit Alexander in Arabiam, ut ibi protegeretur: rex autem Ptolemæus exaltatus est.
17 Et abstulit Zabdiel Arabs caput Alexandri, et misit Ptolemæo.
18 Et rex Ptolemæus mortuus est in die tertia: et qui erant in munitionibus, perierunt ab his qui erant intra castra.
19 Et regnavit Demetrius anno centesimo sexagesimo septimo.

20 In diebus illis congregavit Jonathas eos qui erant in Judæa, ut expugnarent arcem quæ est in Jerusalem: et fecerunt contra eam machinas multas.
21 Et abierunt quidam qui oderant gentem suam viri iniqui ad regem Demetrium, et renuntiaverunt ei quod Jonathas obsideret arcem.
22 Et ut audivit, iratus est: et statim venit ad Ptolemaidam, et scripsit Jonathæ ne obsideret arcem, sed occurreret sibi ad colloquium festinato.
23 Ut audivit autem Jonathas, jussit obsidere: et elegit de senioribus Israël, et de sacerdotibus, et dedit se periculo.
24 Et accepit aurum, et argentum, et vestem, et alia xenia multa, et abiit ad regem Ptolemaidam: et invenit gratiam in conspectu ejus,
25 et interpellabant adversus eum quidam iniqui ex gente sua.
26 Et fecit ei rex sicut fecerant ei qui ante eum fuerant: et exaltavit eum in conspectu omnium amicorum suorum,
27 et statuit ei principatum sacerdotii, et quæcumque alia habuit prius pretiosa, et fecit eum principem amicorum.

28 Et postulavit Jonathas a rege ut immunem faceret Judæam, et tres toparchias, et Samariam et confines ejus: et promisit ei talenta trecenta.
29 Et consensit rex: et scripsit Jonathæ epistolas de his omnibus, hunc modum continentes:
30 Rex Demetrius fratri Jonathæ salutem, et genti Judæorum.
31 Exemplum epistolæ, quam scripsimus Lastheni parenti nostro de vobis, misimus ad vos ut sciretis:
32 Rex Demetrius Lastheni parenti salutem.
33 Genti Judæorum amicis nostris, et conservantibus quæ justa sunt apud nos, decrevimus benefacere propter benignitatem ipsorum, quam erga nos habent.
34 Statuimus ergo illis omnes fines Judææ, et tres civitates, Lydan, et Ramathan, quæ additæ sunt Judææ ex Samaria, et omnes confines earum, sequestrari omnibus sacrificantibus in Jerosolymis pro his quæ ab eis prius accipiebat rex per singulos annos, et pro fructibus terræ et pomorum.
35 Et alia quæ ad nos pertinebant decimarum et tributorum ex hoc tempore, remittimus eis: et areas salinarum, et coronas, quæ nobis deferebantur,
36 omnia ipsis concedimus: et nihil horum irritum erit, ex hoc, et in omne tempus.
37 Nunc ergo curate facere horum exemplum, et detur Jonathæ, et ponatur in monte sancto, in loco celebri.

38 Et videns Demetrius rex quod siluit terra in conspectu suo, et nihil ei resistit, dimisit totum exercitum suum, unumquemque in locum suum, excepto peregrino exercitu, quem contraxit ab insulis gentium: et inimici erant ei omnes exercitus patrum ejus.
39 Tryphon autem erat quidam partium Alexandri prius: et vidit quoniam omnis exercitus murmurabat contra Demetrium, et ivit ad Emalchuel Arabem, qui nutriebat Antiochum filium Alexandri:
40 et assidebat ei, ut traderet eum ipsi, ut regnaret loco patris sui: et enuntiavit ei quanta fecit Demetrius, et inimicitias exercituum ejus adversus illum. Et mansit ibi diebus multis.
41 Et misit Jonathas ad Demetrium regem, ut ejiceret eos qui in arce erant in Jerusalem, et qui in præsidiis erant: quia impugnabant Israël.
42 Et misit Demetrius ad Jonathan, dicens: Non hæc tantum faciam tibi, et genti tuæ, sed gloria illustrabo te, et gentem tuam, cum fuerit opportunum.
43 Nunc ergo recte feceris, si miseris in auxilium mihi viros: quia discessit omnis exercitus meus.
44 Et misit ei Jonathas tria millia virorum fortium Antiochiam: et venerunt ad regem, et delectatus est rex in adventu eorum.
45 Et convenerunt qui erant de civitate, centum viginti millia virorum, et volebant interficere regem.
46 Et fugit rex in aulam: et occupaverunt qui erant de civitate, itinera civitatis, et cœperunt pugnare.
47 Et vocavit rex Judæos in auxilium, et convenerunt omnes simul ad eum, et dispersi sunt omnes per civitatem:
48 et occiderunt in illa die centum millia hominum, et succenderunt civitatem, et ceperunt spolia multa in die illa, et liberaverunt regem.
49 Et viderunt qui erant de civitate, quod obtinuissent Judæi civitatem sicut volebant: et infirmati sunt mente sua, et clamaverunt ad regem cum precibus, dicentes:
50 Da nobis dextras, et cessent Judæi oppugnare nos, et civitatem.
51 Et projecerunt arma sua, et fecerunt pacem, et glorificati sunt Judæi in conspectu regis, et in conspectu omnium qui erant in regno ejus, et nominati sunt in regno: et regressi sunt in Jerusalem habentes spolia multa.

52 Et sedit Demetrius rex in sede regni sui: et siluit terra in conspectu ejus.
53 Et mentitus est omnia quæcumque dixit, et abalienavit se a Jonatha, et non retribuit ei secundum beneficia quæ sibi tribuerat, et vexabat eum valde.
54 Post hæc autem reversus est Tryphon, et Antiochus cum eo puer adolescens, et regnavit, et imposuit sibi diadema.
55 Et congregati sunt ad eum omnes exercitus, quos disperserat Demetrius, et pugnaverunt contra eum: et fugit, et terga vertit.
56 Et accepit Tryphon bestias, et obtinuit Antiochiam.
57 Et scripsit Antiochus adolescens Jonathæ, dicens: Constituo tibi sacerdotium, et constituo te super quatuor civitates, ut sis de amicis regis.
58 Et misit illi vasa aurea in ministerium, et dedit ei potestatem bibendi in auro, et esse in purpura, et habere fibulam auream:
59 et Simonem fratrem ejus constituit ducem a terminis Tyri usque ad fines Ægypti.

60 Et exiit Jonathas, et perambulabat trans flumen civitates: et congregatus est ad eum omnis exercitus Syriæ in auxilium, et venit Ascalonem, et occurrerunt ei honorifice de civitate.
61 Et abiit inde Gazam: et concluserunt se qui erant Gazæ: et obsedit eam, et succendit quæ erant in circuitu civitatis, et prædatus est ea.
62 Et rogaverunt Gazenses Jonathan, et dedit illis dexteram: et accepit filios eorum obsides, et misit illos in Jerusalem: et perambulavit regionem usque Damascum.
63 Et audivit Jonathas quod prævaricati sunt principes Demetrii in Cades, quæ est in Galilæa, cum exercitu multo, volentes eum removere a negotio regni:
64 et occurrit illis: fratrem autem suum Simonem reliquit intra provinciam.

65 Et applicuit Simon ad Bethsuram, et expugnabat eam diebus multis, et conclusit eos.
66 Et postulaverunt ab eo dextras accipere, et dedit illis: et ejecit eos inde, et cepit civitatem, et posuit in ea præsidium.
67 Et Jonathas et castra ejus applicuerunt ad aquam Genesar, et ante lucem vigilaverunt in campo Asor:
68 et ecce castra alienigenarum occurrebant in campo, et tendebant ei insidias in montibus: ipse autem occurrit ex adverso.
69 Insidiæ vero exsurrexerunt de locis suis, et commiserunt prælium.
70 Et fugerunt qui erant ex parte Jonathæ omnes, et nemo relictus est ex eis, nisi Mathathias filius Absolomi, et Judas filius Calphi, princeps militiæ exercitus.
71 Et scidit Jonathas vestimenta sua, et posuit terram in capite suo, et oravit.
72 Et reversus est Jonathas ad eos in prælium, et convertit eos in fugam, et pugnaverunt.
73 Et viderunt qui fugiebant partis illius, et reversi sunt ad eum, et insequebantur cum eo omnes usque Cades ad castra sua, et pervenerunt usque illuc:
74 et ceciderunt de alienigenis in die illa tria millia virorum: et reversus est Jonathas in Jerusalem.

38 καὶ εἶδεν Δημήτριος ὁ βασιλεὺς ὅτι ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐδὲν αὐτῷ ἀνθειστήκει καὶ ἀπέλυσεν πάσας τὰς δυνάμεις αὐτοῦ ἕκαστον εἰς τὸν ἴδιον τόπον πλὴν τῶν ξένων δυνάμεων ὧν ἐξενολόγησεν ἀπὸ τῶν νήσων τῶν ἐθνῶν καὶ ἤχθραναν αὐτῷ πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεις αἱ ἀπὸ τῶν πατέρων
39 Τρύφων δὲ ἦν τῶν παρὰ Ἀλεξάνδρου τὸ πρότερον καὶ εἶδεν ὅτι πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεις καταγογγύζουσιν κατὰ τοῦ Δημητρίου καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς Ιμαλκουε τὸν Ἄραβα ὃς ἔτρεφεν Ἀντίοχον τὸ παιδάριον τὸν τοῦ Ἀλεξάνδρου
40 καὶ προσήδρευεν αὐτῷ ὅπως παραδοῖ αὐτὸν αὐτῷ ὅπως βασιλεύσῃ ἀντὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ ὅσα συνετέλεσεν ὁ Δημήτριος καὶ τὴν ἔχθραν ἣν ἐχθραίνουσιν αὐτῷ αἱ δυνάμεις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔμεινεν ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας πολλάς
41 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιωναθαν πρὸς Δημήτριον τὸν βασιλέα ἵνα ἐκβάλῃ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τοὺς ἐν τοῖς ὀχυρώμασιν ἦσαν γὰρ πολεμοῦντες τὸν Ισραηλ
42 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δημήτριος πρὸς Ιωναθαν λέγων οὐ ταῦτα μόνον ποιήσω σοι καὶ τῷ ἔθνει σου ἀλλὰ δόξῃ δοξάσω σε καὶ τὸ ἔθνος σου ἐὰν εὐκαιρίας τύχω
43 νῦν οὖν ὀρθῶς ποιήσεις ἀποστείλας μοι ἄνδρας οἳ συμμαχήσουσίν μοι ὅτι ἀπέστησαν πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεις μου
44 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιωναθαν ἄνδρας τρισχιλίους δυνατοὺς ἰσχύι αὐτῷ εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ ηὐφράνθη ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τῇ ἐφόδῳ αὐτῶν
45 καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως εἰς μέσον τῆς πόλεως εἰς ἀνδρῶν δώδεκα μυριάδας καὶ ἠβούλοντο ἀνελεῖν τὸν βασιλέα
46 καὶ ἔφυγεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὴν αὐλήν καὶ κατελάβοντο οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως τὰς διόδους τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἤρξαντο πολεμεῖν
47 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς Ιουδαίους ἐπὶ βοήθειαν καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες ἅμα καὶ διεσπάρησαν ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ ἀπέκτειναν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἰς μυριάδας δέκα
48 καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἔλαβον σκῦλα πολλὰ ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ καὶ ἔσωσαν τὸν βασιλέα
49 καὶ εἶδον οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ὅτι κατεκράτησαν οἱ Ιουδαῖοι τῆς πόλεως ὡς ἠβούλοντο καὶ ἠσθένησαν ταῖς διανοίαις αὐτῶν καὶ ἐκέκραξαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα μετὰ δεήσεως λέγοντες
50 δὸς ἡμῖν δεξιὰς καὶ παυσάσθωσαν οἱ Ιουδαῖοι πολεμοῦντες ἡμᾶς καὶ τὴν πόλιν
51 καὶ ἔρριψαν τὰ ὅπλα καὶ ἐποίησαν εἰρήνην καὶ ἐδοξάσθησαν οἱ Ιουδαῖοι ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐνώπιον πάντων τῶν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ ἔχοντες σκῦλα πολλά

52 καὶ ἐκάθισεν Δημήτριος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ θρόνου τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ
53 καὶ ἐψεύσατο πάντα ὅσα εἶπεν καὶ ἠλλοτριώθη τῷ Ιωναθαν καὶ οὐκ ἀνταπέδωκεν τὰς εὐνοίας ἃς ἀνταπέδωκεν αὐτῷ καὶ ἔθλιβεν αὐτὸν σφόδρα
54 μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ἀπέστρεψεν Τρύφων καὶ Ἀντίοχος με{T'} αὐτοῦ παιδάριον νεώτερον καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν καὶ ἐπέθετο διάδημα
55 καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεις ἃς ἀπεσκοράκισεν Δημήτριος καὶ ἐπολέμησαν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ ἔφυγεν καὶ ἐτροπώθη
56 καὶ ἔλαβεν Τρύφων τὰ θηρία καὶ κατεκράτησεν τῆς Ἀντιοχείας
57 καὶ ἔγραψεν Ἀντίοχος ὁ νεώτερος Ιωναθη λέγων ἵστημί σοι τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην καὶ καθίστημί σε ἐπὶ τῶν τεσσάρων νομῶν καὶ εἶναί σε τῶν φίλων τοῦ βασιλέως
58 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ χρυσώματα καὶ διακονίαν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ἐξουσίαν πίνειν ἐν χρυσώμασιν καὶ εἶναι ἐν πορφύρᾳ καὶ ἔχειν πόρπην χρυσῆν
59 καὶ Σιμωνα τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ κατέστησεν στρατηγὸν ἀπὸ τῆς κλίμακος Τύρου ἕως τῶν ὁρίων Αἰγύπτου

60 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ιωναθαν καὶ διεπορεύετο πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν καὶ ἠθροίσθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πᾶσα δύναμις Συρίας εἰς συμμαχίαν καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Ἀσκαλῶνα καὶ ἀπήντησαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ἐνδόξως
61 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Γάζαν καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν οἱ ἀπὸ Γάζης καὶ περιεκάθισεν περὶ αὐτὴν καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν τὰ περιπόλια αὐτῆς ἐν πυρὶ καὶ ἐσκύλευσεν αὐτά
62 καὶ ἠξίωσαν οἱ ἀπὸ Γάζης Ιωναθαν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς δεξιὰς καὶ ἔλαβεν τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτῶν εἰς ὅμηρα καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ διῆλθεν τὴν χώραν ἕως Δαμασκοῦ
63 καὶ ἤκουσεν Ιωναθαν ὅτι παρῆσαν οἱ ἄρχοντες Δημητρίου εἰς Κηδες τὴν ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς βουλόμενοι μεταστῆσαι αὐτὸν τῆς χρείας
64 καὶ συνήντησεν αὐτοῖς τὸν δὲ ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ Σιμωνα κατέλιπεν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ

65 καὶ παρενέβαλεν Σιμων ἐπὶ Βαιθσουρα καὶ ἐπολέμει αὐτὴν ἡμέρας πολλὰς καὶ συνέκλεισεν αὐτήν
66 καὶ ἠξίωσαν αὐτὸν τοῦ δεξιὰς λαβεῖν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐξέβαλεν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖθεν καὶ κατελάβετο τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἔθετο ἐ{P'} αὐτὴν φρουράν
67 καὶ Ιωναθαν καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ Γεννησαρ καὶ ὤρθρισαν τὸ πρωὶ εἰς τὸ πεδίον Ασωρ
68 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ παρεμβολὴ ἀλλοφύλων ἀπήντα αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ καὶ ἐξέβαλον ἔνεδρον ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀπήντησαν ἐξ ἐναντίας
69 τὰ δὲ ἔνεδρα ἐξανέστησαν ἐκ τῶν τόπων αὐτῶν καὶ συνῆψαν πόλεμον
70 καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ παρὰ Ιωναθου πάντες οὐδὲ εἷς κατελείφθη ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν πλὴν Ματταθιας ὁ τοῦ Αψαλωμου καὶ Ιουδας ὁ τοῦ Χαλφι ἄρχοντες τῆς στρατιᾶς τῶν δυνάμεων
71 καὶ διέρρηξεν Ιωναθαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέθετο γῆν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ προσηύξατο
72 καὶ ὑπέστρεψεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς πολέμῳ καὶ ἐτροπώσατο αὐτούς καὶ ἔφυγον
73 καὶ εἶδον οἱ φεύγοντες πα{R'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν καὶ ἐδίωκον με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἕως Κεδες ἕως τῆς παρεμβολῆς αὐτῶν καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐκεῖ
74 καὶ ἔπεσον ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἰς ἄνδρας τρισχιλίους καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ιωναθαν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ
