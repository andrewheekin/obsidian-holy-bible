# Book of Ezekiel 40 (RSVCE)

### The Vision of the New Temple
1 In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was conquered, on that very day, the hand of theLordwas upon me,
2 and brought me in the visions of God into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city opposite me.
3 When he brought me there, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like bronze, with a line of flax and a measuring reed in his hand; and he was standing in the gateway.
4 And the man said to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your mind upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you; declare all that you see to the house of Israel.”
5 And behold, there was a wall all around the outside of the temple area, and the length of the measuring reed in the man’s hand was six long cubits, each being a cubit and a handbreadth in length; so he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.
6 Then he went into the gateway facing east, going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep;
7 and the side rooms, one reed long, and one reed broad; and the space between the side rooms, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end, one reed.
8 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits;
9 and its jambs, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end.
10 And there were three side rooms on either side of the east gate; the three were of the same size; and the jambs on either side were of the same size.
11 Then he measured the breadth of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the breadth of the gateway, thirteen cubits.
12 There was a barrier before the side rooms, one cubit on either side; and the side rooms were six cubits on either side.
13 Then he measured the gate from the back of the one side room to the back of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits, from door to door.
14 He measured also the vestibule, twenty cubits; and round about the vestibule of the gateway was the court.
15 From the front of the gate at the entrance to the end of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.
16 And the gateway had windows round about, narrowing inwards into their jambs in the side rooms, and likewise the vestibule had windows round about inside, and on the jambs were palm trees.
17 Then he brought me into the outer court; and behold, there were chambers and a pavement, round about the court; thirty chambers fronted on the pavement.
18 And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.
19 Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, a hundred cubits. Then he went before me to the north,
20 and behold, there was a gate which faced toward the north, belonging to the outer court. He measured its length and its breadth.
21 Its side rooms, three on either side, and its jambs and its vestibule were of the same size as those of the first gate; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
22 And its windows, its vestibule, and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate which faced toward the east; and seven steps led up to it; and its vestibule was on the inside.
23 And opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner court; and he measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.
24 And he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate on the south; and he measured its jambs and its vestibule; they had the same size as the others.
25 And there were windows round about in it and in its vestibule, like the windows of the others; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
26 And there were seven steps leading up to it, and its vestibule was on the inside; and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side.
27 And there was a gate on the south of the inner court; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.
28 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it was of the same size as the others.
29 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and there were windows round about in it and in its vestibule; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
30 And there were vestibules round about, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad.
31 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps.
32 Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate; it was of the same size as the others.
33 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and there were windows round about in it and in its vestibule; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
34 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side; and its stairway had eight steps.
35 Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it; it had the same size as the others.
36 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and it had windows round about; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
37 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side; and its stairway had eight steps.
38 There was a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, where the burnt offering was to be washed.
39 And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered.
40 And on the outside of the vestibule at the entrance of the north gate were two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables.
41 Four tables were on the inside, and four tables on the outside of the side of the gate, eight tables, on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered.
42 And there were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered.
43 And hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened round about within. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.
44 Then he brought me from without into the inner court, and behold, there were two chambers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the south gate facing north.
45 And he said to me, This chamber which faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple,
46 and the chamber which faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, who alone among the sons of Levi may come near to theLordto minister to him.
47 And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was in front of the temple.
### The Temple
48 Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on either side; and the breadth of the gate was fourteen cubits; and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side.
49 The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve cubits; and ten steps led up to it; and there were pillars beside the jambs on either side.


# Prophetia Ezechielis 40 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In vigesimo quinto anno transmigrationis nostræ, in exordio anni, decima mensis, quartodecimo anno postquam percussa est civitas, in ipsa hac die, facta est super me manus Domini, et adduxit me illuc.
2 In visionibus Dei adduxit me in terram Israël, et dimisit me super montem excelsum nimis, super quem erat quasi ædificium civitatis vergentis ad austrum.
3 Et introduxit me illuc: et ecce vir cujus erat species quasi species æris, et funiculus lineus in manu ejus, et calamus mensuræ in manu ejus: stabat autem in porta.
4 Et locutus est ad me idem vir: Fili hominis, vide oculis tuis, et auribus tuis audi, et pone cor tuum in omnia quæ ego ostendam tibi, quia ut ostendantur tibi adductus es huc. Annuntia omnia quæ tu vides domui Israël.

5 Et ecce murus forinsecus in circuitu domus undique: et in manu viri calamus mensuræ sex cubitorum et palmo: et mensus est latitudinem ædificii calamo uno, altitudinem quoque calamo uno.
6 Et venit ad portam quæ respiciebat viam orientalem, et ascendit per gradus ejus: et mensus est limen portæ calamo uno latitudinem, id est, limen unum calamo uno in latitudine.
7 Et thalamum uno calamo in longum, et uno calamo in latum: et inter thalamos, quinque cubitos.
8 Et limen portæ, juxta vestibulum portæ intrinsecus, calamo uno.
9 Et mensus est vestibulum portæ octo cubitorum, et frontem ejus duobus cubitis: vestibulum autem portæ erat intrinsecus.
10 Porro thalami portæ ad viam orientalem, tres hinc et tres inde: mensura una trium, et mensura una frontium ex utraque parte.
11 Et mensus est latitudinem liminis portæ decem cubitorum, et longitudinem portæ tredecim cubitorum.
12 Et marginem ante thalamos, cubiti unius, et cubitus unus finis utrimque: thalami autem sex cubitorum erant hinc et inde.
13 Et mensus est portam a tecto thalami usque ad tectum ejus, latitudinem viginti quinque cubitorum, ostium contra ostium.
14 Et fecit frontes per sexaginta cubitos, et ad frontem atrium portæ undique per circuitum.
15 Et ante faciem portæ quæ pertingebat usque ad faciem vestibuli portæ interioris, quinquaginta cubitos.
16 Et fenestras obliquas in thalamis et in frontibus eorum, quæ erant intra portam undique per circuitum: similiter autem erant et in vestibulis fenestræ per gyrum intrinsecus, et ante frontes pictura palmarum.

17 Et eduxit me ad atrium exterius: et ecce gazophylacia, et pavimentum stratum lapide in atrio per circuitum: triginta gazophylacia in circuitu pavimenti.
18 Et pavimentum in fronte portarum, secundum longitudinem portarum erat inferius.
19 Et mensus est latitudinem a facie portæ inferioris usque ad frontem atrii interioris extrinsecus: centum cubitos ad orientem et ad aquilonem.
20 Portam quoque quæ respiciebat viam aquilonis atrii exterioris, mensus est tam in longitudine quam in latitudine.
21 Et thalamos ejus tres hinc et tres inde, et frontem ejus et vestibulum ejus secundum mensuram portæ prioris, quinquaginta cubitorum longitudinem ejus, et latitudinem viginti quinque cubitorum.
22 Fenestræ autem ejus, et vestibulum, et sculpturæ secundum mensuram portæ quæ respiciebat ad orientem: et septem graduum erat ascensus ejus, et vestibulum ante eam.
23 Et porta atrii interioris contra portam aquilonis et orientalem: et mensus est a porta usque ad portam centum cubitos.
24 Et eduxit me ad viam australem: et ecce porta quæ respiciebat ad austrum: et mensus est frontem ejus et vestibulum ejus juxta mensuras superiores.
25 Et fenestras ejus, et vestibula in circuitu, sicut fenestras ceteras: quinquaginta cubitorum longitudine, et latitudine viginti quinque cubitorum.
26 Et in gradibus septem ascendebatur ad eam, et vestibulum ante fores ejus: et cælatæ palmæ erant, una hinc, et altera inde, in fronte ejus.
27 Et porta atrii interioris in via australi: et mensus est a porta usque ad portam in via australi, centum cubitos.

28 Et introduxit me in atrium interius ad portam australem: et mensus est portam juxta mensuras superiores.
29 Thalamum ejus, et frontem ejus, et vestibulum ejus eisdem mensuris, et fenestras ejus, et vestibulum ejus in circuitu, quinquaginta cubitos longitudinis, et latitudinis viginti quinque cubitos.
30 Et vestibulum per gyrum longitudine viginti quinque cubitorum, et latitudine quinque cubitorum:
31 et vestibulum ejus ad atrium exterius, et palmas ejus in fronte: et octo gradus erant quibus ascendebatur per eam.
32 Et introduxit me in atrium interius, per viam orientalem: et mensus est portam secundum mensuras superiores.
33 Thalamum ejus, et frontem ejus, et vestibulum ejus, sicut supra: et fenestras ejus, et vestibula ejus in circuitu, longitudine quinquaginta cubitorum, et latitudine viginti quinque cubitorum.
34 Et vestibulum ejus, id est, atrii exterioris, et palmæ cælatæ in fronte ejus, hinc et inde: et in octo gradibus ascensus ejus.
35 Et introduxit me ad portam quæ respiciebat ad aquilonem: et mensus est secundum mensuras superiores.
36 Thalamum ejus, et frontem ejus, et vestibulum ejus, et fenestras ejus per circuitum, longitudine quinquaginta cubitorum, et latitudine viginti quinque cubitorum.
37 Et vestibulum ejus respiciebat ad atrium exterius: et cælatura palmarum in fronte ejus, hinc et inde: et in octo gradibus ascensus ejus.

38 Et per singula gazophylacia ostium in frontibus portarum: ibi lavabant holocaustum.
39 Et in vestibulo portæ, duæ mensæ hinc, et duæ mensæ inde, ut immoletur super eas holocaustum, et pro peccato et pro delicto.
40 Et ad latus exterius, quod ascendit ad ostium portæ quæ pergit ad aquilonem, duæ mensæ: et ad latus alterum, ante vestibulum portæ, duæ mensæ:
41 quatuor mensæ hinc, et quatuor mensæ inde: per latera portæ octo mensæ erant, super quas immolabant.
42 Quatuor autem mensæ ad holocaustum de lapidibus quadris exstructæ, longitudine cubiti unius et dimidii, et latitudine cubiti unius et dimidii, et altitudine cubiti unius: super quas ponant vasa in quibus immolatur holocaustum et victima.
43 Et labia earum palmi unius, reflexa intrinsecus per circuitum: super mensas autem carnes oblationis.

44 Et extra portam interiorem, gazophylacia cantorum in atrio interiori, quod erat in latere portæ respicientis ad aquilonem: et facies eorum contra viam australem: una ex latere portæ orientalis, quæ respiciebat ad viam aquilonis.
45 Et dixit ad me: Hoc est gazophylacium quod respicit viam meridianam: sacerdotum erit, qui excubant in custodiis templi.
46 Porro gazophylacium quod respicit ad viam aquilonis, sacerdotum erit, qui excubant ad ministerium altaris: isti sunt filii Sadoc, qui accedunt de filiis Levi ad Dominum ut ministrent ei.
47 Et mensus est atrium longitudine centum cubitorum, et latitudine centum cubitorum per quadrum: et altare ante faciem templi.

48 Et introduxit me in vestibulum templi: et mensus est vestibulum quinque cubitis hinc, et quinque cubitis inde: et latitudinem portæ trium cubitorum hinc, et trium cubitorum inde.
