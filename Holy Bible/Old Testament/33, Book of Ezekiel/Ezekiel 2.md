# Book of Ezekiel 2 (RSVCE)

### The Vision of the Scroll
1 And he said to me, “Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak with you.”
2 And when he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet; and I heard him speaking to me.
3 And he said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to a nation of rebels, who have rebelled against me; they and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day.
4 The people also are impudent and stubborn: I send you to them; and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LordGod.’
5 And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that there has been a prophet among them.
6 And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit upon scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
7 And you shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear; for they are a rebellious house.
8 “But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth, and eat what I give you.”
9 And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and lo, a written scroll was in it;
10 and he spread it before me; and it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.


# Prophetia Ezechielis 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Hæc visio similitudinis gloriæ Domini. Et vidi, et cecidi in faciem meam, et audivi vocem loquentis, et dixit ad me: Fili hominis, sta super pedes tuos, et loquar tecum.
2 Et ingressus est in me spiritus postquam locutus est mihi, et statuit me supra pedes meos: et audivi loquentem ad me,
3 et dicentem: Fili hominis, mitto ego te ad filios Israël, ad gentes apostatrices quæ recesserunt a me: ipsi et patres eorum prævaricati sunt pactum meum usque ad diem hanc:
4 et filii dura facie et indomabili corde sunt, ad quos ego mitto te. Et dices ad eos: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus:
5 si forte vel ipsi audiant, et si forte quiescant, quoniam domus exasperans est: et scient quia propheta fuerit in medio eorum.
6 Tu ergo, fili hominis, ne timeas eos, neque sermones eorum metuas, quoniam increduli et subversores sunt tecum, et cum scorpionibus habitas. Verba eorum ne timeas, et vultus eorum ne formides, quia domus exasperans est.
7 Loqueris ergo verba mea ad eos, si forte audiant, et quiescant: quoniam irritatores sunt.

8 Tu autem, fili hominis, audi quæcumque loquor ad te, et noli esse exasperans, sicut domus exasperatrix est: aperi os tuum, et comede quæcumque ego do tibi.
9 Et vidi: et ecce manus missa ad me, in qua erat involutus liber:


# Ἰεζεκιήλ 2 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ εἶπεν πρός με υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου στῆθι ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας σου καὶ λαλήσω πρὸς σέ
2 καὶ ἦλθεν ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ πνεῦμα καὶ ἀνέλαβέν με καὶ ἐξῆρέν με καὶ ἔστησέν με ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας μου καὶ ἤκουον αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος πρός με
3 καὶ εἶπεν πρός με υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου ἐξαποστέλλω ἐγώ σε πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ισραηλ τοὺς παραπικραίνοντάς με οἵτινες παρεπίκρανάν με αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας
4 καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς τάδε λέγει κύριος
5 ἐὰν ἄρα ἀκούσωσιν ἢ πτοηθῶσιν διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστίν καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι προφήτης εἶ σὺ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν
6 καὶ σύ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου μὴ φοβηθῇς αὐτοὺς μηδὲ ἐκστῇς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν διότι παροιστρήσουσι καὶ ἐπισυστήσονται ἐπὶ σὲ κύκλῳ καὶ ἐν μέσῳ σκορπίων σὺ κατοικεῖς τοὺς λόγους αὐτῶν μὴ φοβηθῇς καὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν μὴ ἐκστῇς διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστίν
7 καὶ λαλήσεις τοὺς λόγους μου πρὸς αὐτούς ἐὰν ἄρα ἀκούσωσιν ἢ πτοηθῶσιν διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστίν

8 καὶ σύ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου ἄκουε τοῦ λαλοῦντος πρὸς σέ μὴ γίνου παραπικραίνων καθὼς ὁ οἶκος ὁ παραπικραίνων χάνε τὸ στόμα σου καὶ φάγε ἃ ἐγὼ δίδωμί σοι
9 καὶ εἶδον καὶ ἰδοὺ χεὶρ ἐκτεταμένη πρός με καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ κεφαλὶς βιβλίου
