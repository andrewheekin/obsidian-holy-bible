# Book of Ezekiel 19 (RSVCE)

### Israel Degraded
1 And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
2 and say: What a lioness was your mother among lions! She couched in the midst of young lions, rearing her whelps.
3 And she brought up one of her whelps; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.
4 The nations sounded an alarm against him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
5 When she saw that she was baffled, that her hope was lost, she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion.
6 He prowled among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.
7 And he ravaged their strongholds, and laid waste their cities; and the land was appalled and all who were in it at the sound of his roaring.
8 Then the nations set against him snareston every side; they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
9 With hooks they put him in a cage, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into custody, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
10 Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard transplanted by the water, fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water.
11 Its strongest stem became a ruler’s scepter; it towered aloft among the thick boughs; it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.
12 But the vine was plucked up in fury, cast down to the ground; the east wind dried it up; its fruit was stripped off, its strong stem was withered; the fire consumed it.
13 Now it is transplanted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
14 And fire has gone out from its stem, has consumed its branches and fruit, so that there remains in it no strong stem, no scepter for a ruler. This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.


# Prophetia Ezechielis 19 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et tu assume planctum super principes Israël,
2 et dices:Quare mater tua leæna inter leones cubavit?in medio leunculorum enutrivit catulos suos?
3 Et eduxit unum de leunculis suis,et leo factus est:et didicit capere prædam,hominemque comedere.
4 Et audierunt de eo gentes:et non absque vulneribus suis ceperunt eum,et adduxerunt eum in catenis in terram Ægypti.
5 Quæ cum vidisset quoniam infirmata est,et periit exspectatio ejus,tulit unum de leunculis suis;leonem constituit eum.
6 Qui incedebat inter leones,et factus est leo:et didicit prædam capere,et homines devorare:
7 didicit viduas facere,et civitates earum in desertum adducere:et desolata est terra et plenitudo ejus a voce rugitus illius.
8 Et convenerunt adversus eum gentes undique de provinciis,et expanderunt super eum rete suum:in vulneribus earum captus est,
9 et miserunt eum in caveam:in catenis adduxerunt eum ad regem Babylonis,miseruntque eum in carcerem,ne audiretur vox ejus ultra super montes Israël.

10 Mater tua quasi vinea in sanguine tuo super aquam plantata est:fructus ejus et frondes ejus creverunt ex aquis multis.
11 Et factæ sunt ei virgæ solidæ in sceptra dominantium,et exaltata est statura ejus inter frondes,et vidit altitudinem suam in multitudine palmitum suorum.
12 Et evulsa est in ira, in terramque projecta,et ventus urens siccavit fructum ejus:marcuerunt et arefactæ sunt virgæ roboris ejus:ignis comedit eam.
13 Et nunc transplantata est in desertum,in terra invia et sitienti.
14 Et egressus est ignis de virga ramorum ejus,qui fructum ejus comedit:et non fuit in ea virga fortis,sceptrum dominantium.Planctus est, et erit in planctum.


# Ἰεζεκιήλ 19 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ σὺ λαβὲ θρῆνον ἐπὶ τὸν ἄρχοντα τοῦ Ισραηλ
2 καὶ ἐρεῖς τί ἡ μήτηρ σου σκύμνος ἐν μέσῳ λεόντων ἐγενήθη ἐν μέσῳ λεόντων ἐπλήθυνεν σκύμνους αὐτῆς
3 καὶ ἀπεπήδησεν εἷς τῶν σκύμνων αὐτῆς λέων ἐγένετο καὶ ἔμαθεν τοῦ ἁρπάζειν ἁρπάγματα ἀνθρώπους ἔφαγεν
4 καὶ ἤκουσαν κα{T'} αὐτοῦ ἔθνη ἐν τῇ διαφθορᾷ αὐτῶν συνελήμφθη καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν ἐν κημῷ εἰς γῆν Αἰγύπτου
5 καὶ εἶδεν ὅτι ἀπῶσται ἀ{P'} αὐτῆς καὶ ἀπώλετο ἡ ὑπόστασις αὐτῆς καὶ ἔλαβεν ἄλλον ἐκ τῶν σκύμνων αὐτῆς λέοντα ἔταξεν αὐτόν
6 καὶ ἀνεστρέφετο ἐν μέσῳ λεόντων λέων ἐγένετο καὶ ἔμαθεν ἁρπάζειν ἁρπάγματα ἀνθρώπους ἔφαγεν
7 καὶ ἐνέμετο τῷ θράσει αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν ἐξηρήμωσεν καὶ ἠφάνισεν γῆν καὶ τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῆς ἀπὸ φωνῆς ὠρύματος αὐτοῦ
8 καὶ ἔδωκαν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν ἔθνη ἐκ χωρῶν κυκλόθεν καὶ ἐξεπέτασαν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν δίκτυα αὐτῶν ἐν διαφθορᾷ αὐτῶν συνελήμφθη
9 καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτὸν ἐν κημῷ καὶ ἐν γαλεάγρᾳ ἦλθεν πρὸς βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς φυλακήν ὅπως μὴ ἀκουσθῇ ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη τοῦ Ισραηλ

10 ἡ μήτηρ σου ὡς ἄμπελος ὡς ἄνθος ἐν ῥόᾳ ἐν ὕδατι πεφυτευμένη ὁ καρπὸς αὐτῆς καὶ ὁ βλαστὸς αὐτῆς ἐγένετο ἐξ ὕδατος πολλοῦ
11 καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῇ ῥάβδος ἰσχύος ἐπὶ φυλὴν ἡγουμένων καὶ ὑψώθη τῷ μεγέθει αὐτῆς ἐν μέσῳ στελεχῶν καὶ εἶδεν τὸ μέγεθος αὐτῆς ἐν πλήθει κλημάτων αὐτῆς
12 καὶ κατεκλάσθη ἐν θυμῷ ἐπὶ γῆν ἐρρίφη καὶ ἄνεμος ὁ καύσων ἐξήρανεν τὰ ἐκλεκτὰ αὐτῆς ἐξεδικήθη καὶ ἐξηράνθη ἡ ῥάβδος ἰσχύος αὐτῆς πῦρ ἀνήλωσεν αὐτήν
13 καὶ νῦν πεφύτευκαν αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐν γῇ ἀνύδρῳ
14 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν πῦρ ἐκ ῥάβδου ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτῆς καὶ κατέφαγεν αὐτήν καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτῇ ῥάβδος ἰσχύος φυλὴ εἰς παραβολὴν θρήνου ἐστὶν καὶ ἔσται εἰς θρῆνον
