# Book of Ezekiel 10 (RSVCE)

### God’s Glory Leaves Jerusalem
1 Then I looked, and behold, on the firmament that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in form resembling a throne.
2 And he said to the man clothed in linen, “Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim; fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he went in before my eyes.
3 Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in; and a cloud filled the inner court.
4 And the glory of theLordwent up from the cherubim to the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of theLord.
5 And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
6 And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” he went in and stood beside a wheel.
7 And a cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
8 The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.
9 And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling chrysolite.
10 And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel.
11 When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went, but in whatever direction the front wheel faced the others followed without turning as they went.
12 And their rims, and their spokes, and the wheels were full of eyes round about—the wheels that the four of them had.
13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels.
14 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
15 And the cherubim mounted up. These were the living creatures that I saw by the river Chebar.
16 And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them.
17 When they stood still, these stood still, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
18 Then the glory of theLordwent forth from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
19 And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight as they went forth, with the wheels beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the house of theLord; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
20 These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.
21 Each had four faces, and each four wings, and underneath their wings the semblance of human hands.
22 And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the very faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar. They went every one straight forward.


# Prophetia Ezechielis 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et vidi: et ecce in firmamento quod erat super caput cherubim, quasi lapis sapphirus, quasi species similitudinis solii, apparuit super ea.

2 Et dixit ad virum qui indutus erat lineis, et ait: Ingredere in medio rotarum quæ sunt subtus cherubim, et imple manum tuam prunis ignis quæ sunt inter cherubim, et effunde super civitatem. Ingressusque est in conspectu meo.
3 Cherubim autem stabant a dextris domus cum ingrederetur vir, et nubes implevit atrium interius.
4 Et elevata est gloria Domini desuper cherub ad limen domus: et repleta est domus nube, et atrium repletum est splendore gloriæ Domini.
5 Et sonitus alarum cherubim audiebatur usque ad atrium exterius, quasi vox Dei omnipotentis loquentis.
6 Cumque præcepisset viro qui indutus erat lineis, dicens: Sume ignem de medio rotarum quæ sunt inter cherubim: ingressus ille stetit juxta rotam.
7 Et extendit cherub manum de medio cherubim ad ignem qui erat inter cherubim, et sumpsit, et dedit in manus ejus qui indutus erat lineis: qui accipiens egressus est.
8 Et apparuit in cherubim similitudo manus hominis subtus pennas eorum.

9 Et vidi: et ecce quatuor rotæ juxta cherubim: rota una juxta cherub unum, et rota alia juxta cherub unum: species autem rotarum erat quasi visio lapidis chrysolithi:
10 et aspectus earum similitudo una quatuor, quasi sit rota in medio rotæ.
11 Cumque ambularent, in quatuor partes gradiebantur, et non revertebantur ambulantes: sed ad locum ad quem ire declinabat quæ prima erat, sequebantur et ceteræ, nec convertebantur.
12 Et omne corpus earum, et colla, et manus, et pennæ, et circuli, plena erant oculis in circuitu quatuor rotarum.
13 Et rotas istas vocavit volubiles, audiente me.
14 Quatuor autem facies habebat unum: facies una, facies cherub, et facies secunda, facies hominis: et in tertio facies leonis, et in quarto facies aquilæ.
15 Et elevata sunt cherubim: ipsum est animal quod videram juxta fluvium Chobar.
16 Cumque ambularent cherubim, ibant pariter et rotæ juxta ea: et cum elevarent cherubim alas suas ut exaltarentur de terra, non residebant rotæ, sed et ipsæ juxta erant.
17 Stantibus illis stabant, et cum elevatis elevabantur: spiritus enim vitæ erat in eis.
18 Et egressa est gloria Domini a limine templi, et stetit super cherubim.
19 Et elevantia cherubim alas suas, exaltata sunt a terra coram me: et illis egredientibus, rotæ quoque subsecutæ sunt: et stetit in introitu portæ domus Domini orientalis, et gloria Dei Israël erat super ea.
20 Ipsum est animal quod vidi subter Deum Israël juxta fluvium Chobar, et intellexi quia cherubim essent.
21 Quatuor vultus uni, et quatuor alæ uni: et similitudo manus hominis sub alis eorum.
22 Et similitudo vultuum eorum, ipsi vultus quos videram juxta fluvium Chobar, et intuitus eorum, et impetus singulorum ante faciem suam ingredi.


# Ἰεζεκιήλ 10 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ εἶδον καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐπάνω τοῦ στερεώματος τοῦ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς τῶν χερουβιν ὡς λίθος σαπφείρου ὁμοίωμα θρόνου ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν

2 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν ἐνδεδυκότα τὴν στολήν εἴσελθε εἰς τὸ μέσον τῶν τροχῶν τῶν ὑποκάτω τῶν χερουβιν καὶ πλῆσον τὰς δράκας σου ἀνθράκων πυρὸς ἐκ μέσου τῶν χερουβιν καὶ διασκόρπισον ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἐνώπιόν μου
3 καὶ τὰ χερουβιν εἱστήκει ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ οἴκου ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι τὸν ἄνδρα καὶ ἡ νεφέλη ἔπλησεν τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐσωτέραν
4 καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἡ δόξα κυρίου ἀπὸ τῶν χερουβιν εἰς τὸ αἴθριον τοῦ οἴκου καὶ ἔπλησεν τὸν οἶκον ἡ νεφέλη καὶ ἡ αὐλὴ ἐπλήσθη τοῦ φέγγους τῆς δόξης κυρίου
5 καὶ φωνὴ τῶν πτερύγων τῶν χερουβιν ἠκούετο ἕως τῆς αὐλῆς τῆς ἐξωτέρας ὡς φωνὴ θεοῦ Σαδδαι λαλοῦντος
6 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐντέλλεσθαι αὐτὸν τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ ἐνδεδυκότι τὴν στολὴν τὴν ἁγίαν λέγων λαβὲ πῦρ ἐκ μέσου τῶν τροχῶν ἐκ μέσου τῶν χερουβιν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ἔστη ἐχόμενος τῶν τροχῶν
7 καὶ ἐξέτεινεν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς μέσον τοῦ πυρὸς τοῦ ὄντος ἐν μέσῳ τῶν χερουβιν καὶ ἔλαβεν καὶ ἔδωκεν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ ἐνδεδυκότος τὴν στολὴν τὴν ἁγίαν καὶ ἔλαβεν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν
8 καὶ εἶδον τὰ χερουβιν ὁμοίωμα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων ὑποκάτωθεν τῶν πτερύγων αὐτῶν

9 καὶ εἶδον καὶ ἰδοὺ τροχοὶ τέσσαρες εἱστήκεισαν ἐχόμενοι τῶν χερουβιν τροχὸς εἷς ἐχόμενος χερουβ ἑνός καὶ ἡ ὄψις τῶν τροχῶν ὡς ὄψις λίθου ἄνθρακος
10 καὶ ἡ ὄψις αὐτῶν ὁμοίωμα ἓν τοῖς τέσσαρσιν ὃν τρόπον ὅταν ᾖ τροχὸς ἐν μέσῳ τροχοῦ
11 ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι αὐτὰ εἰς τὰ τέσσαρα μέρη αὐτῶν ἐπορεύοντο οὐκ ἐπέστρεφον ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι αὐτά ὅτι εἰς ὃν ἂν τόπον ἐπέβλεψεν ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μία ἐπορεύοντο καὶ οὐκ ἐπέστρεφον ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι αὐτά
12 καὶ οἱ νῶτοι αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ τροχοὶ πλήρεις ὀφθαλμῶν κυκλόθεν τοῖς τέσσαρσιν τροχοῖς αὐτῶν
13 τοῖς δὲ τροχοῖς τούτοις ἐπεκλήθη Γελγελ ἀκούοντός μου
14 
15 καὶ ἦραν τὰ χερουβιν τοῦτο τὸ ζῷον ὃ εἶδον ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβαρ
16 καὶ ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι τὰ χερουβιν ἐπορεύοντο οἱ τροχοί καὶ οὗτοι ἐχόμενοι αὐτῶν καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐξαίρειν τὰ χερουβιν τὰς πτέρυγας αὐτῶν τοῦ μετεωρίζεσθαι ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς οὐκ ἐπέστρεφον οἱ τροχοὶ αὐτῶν
17 ἐν τῷ ἑστάναι αὐτὰ εἱστήκεισαν καὶ ἐν τῷ μετεωρίζεσθαι αὐτὰ ἐμετεωρίζοντο με{T'} αὐτῶν διότι πνεῦμα ζωῆς ἐν αὐτοῖς ἦν
18 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν δόξα κυρίου ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου καὶ ἐπέβη ἐπὶ τὰ χερουβιν
19 καὶ ἀνέλαβον τὰ χερουβιν τὰς πτέρυγας αὐτῶν καὶ ἐμετεωρίσθησαν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ ἐν τῷ ἐξελθεῖν αὐτὰ καὶ οἱ τροχοὶ ἐχόμενοι αὐτῶν καὶ ἔστησαν ἐπὶ τὰ πρόθυρα τῆς πύλης οἴκου κυρίου τῆς ἀπέναντι καὶ δόξα θεοῦ Ισραηλ ἦν ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν ὑπεράνω
20 τοῦτο τὸ ζῷόν ἐστιν ὃ εἶδον ὑποκάτω θεοῦ Ισραηλ ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβαρ καὶ ἔγνων ὅτι χερουβιν ἐστίν
21 τέσσαρα πρόσωπα τῷ ἑνί καὶ ὀκτὼ πτέρυγες τῷ ἑνί καὶ ὁμοίωμα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπου ὑποκάτωθεν τῶν πτερύγων αὐτῶν
22 καὶ ὁμοίωσις τῶν προσώπων αὐτῶν ταῦτα τὰ πρόσωπά ἐστιν ἃ εἶδον ὑποκάτω τῆς δόξης θεοῦ Ισραηλ ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβαρ καὶ αὐτὰ ἕκαστον κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν ἐπορεύοντο
