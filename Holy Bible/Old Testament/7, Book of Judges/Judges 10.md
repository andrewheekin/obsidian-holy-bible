# Book of Judges 10 (RSVCE)

### Tola and Jair
1 After Abimʹelech there arose to deliver Israel Tola the son of Puʹah, son of Dodo, a man of Isʹsachar; and he lived at Shamir in the hill country of Eʹphraim.
2 And he judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died, and was buried at Shamir.
3 After him arose Jaʹir the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years.
4 And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty asses; and they had thirty cities, called Havʹvoth-jaʹir to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
5 And Jaʹir died, and was buried in Kamon.
### Oppression by the Ammonites
6 And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of theLord, and served the Baʹals and the Ashʹtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook theLord, and did not serve him.
7 And the anger of theLordwas kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites,
8 and they crushed and oppressed the children of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
9 And the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Eʹphraim; so that Israel was sorely distressed.
10 And the people of Israel cried to theLord, saying, “We have sinned against thee, because we have forsaken our God and have served the Baʹals.”
11 And theLordsaid to the people of Israel, “Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites, from the Ammonites and from the Philistines?
12 The Sidoʹnians also, and the Amalʹekites, and the Maʹonites, oppressed you; and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.
13 Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods; therefore I will deliver you no more.
14 Go and cry to the gods whom you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress.”
15 And the people of Israel said to theLord, “We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to thee; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.”
16 So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served theLord; and he became indignant over the misery of Israel.
17 Then the Ammonites were called to arms, and they encamped in Gilead; and the people of Israel came together, and they encamped at Mizpah.
18 And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said one to another, “Who is the man that will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”


# Liber Judicum 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Post Abimelech surrexit dux in Israël Thola filius Phua patrui Abimelech, vir de Issachar, qui habitavit in Samir montis Ephraim:
2 et judicavit Israëlem viginti et tribus annis, mortuusque est, ac sepultus in Samir.
3 Huic successit Jair Galaadites, qui judicavit Israël per viginti et duos annos,
4 habens triginta filios sedentes super triginta pullos asinarum, et principes triginta civitatum, quæ ex nomine ejus sunt appellatæ Havoth Jair, id est, oppida Jair, usque in præsentem diem, in terra Galaad.
5 Mortuusque est Jair, ac sepultus in loco cui est vocabulum Camon.

6 Filii autem Israël peccatis veteribus jungentes nova, fecerunt malum in conspectu Domini, et servierunt idolis, Baalim et Astaroth, et diis Syriæ ac Sidonis et Moab et filiorum Ammon et Philisthiim: dimiseruntque Dominum, et non coluerunt eum.
7 Contra quos Dominus iratus, tradidit eos in manus Philisthiim et filiorum Ammon.
8 Afflictique sunt, et vehementer oppressi per annos decem et octo, omnes qui habitabant trans Jordanem in terra Amorrhæi, qui est in Galaad:
9 in tantum ut filii Ammon, Jordane transmisso, vastarent Judam et Benjamin et Ephraim: afflictusque est Israël nimis.
10 Et clamantes ad Dominum, dixerunt: Peccavimus tibi, quia dereliquimus Dominum Deum nostrum, et servivimus Baalim.
11 Quibus locutus est Dominus: Numquid non Ægyptii et Amorrhæi, filiique Ammon et Philisthiim,
12 Sidonii quoque et Amalec et Chanaan oppresserunt vos, et clamastis ad me, et erui vos de manu eorum?
13 Et tamen reliquistis me, et coluistis deos alienos: idcirco non addam ut ultra vos liberem:
14 ite, et invocate deos quos elegistis: ipsi vos liberent in tempore angustiæ.
15 Dixeruntque filii Israël ad Dominum: Peccavimus, redde tu nobis quidquid tibi placet: tantum nunc libera nos.
16 Quæ dicentes, omnia de finibus suis alienorum deorum idola projecerunt, et servierunt Domino Deo: qui doluit super miseriis eorum.

17 Itaque filii Ammon conclamantes in Galaad fixere tentoria, contra quos congregati filii Israël in Maspha castrametati sunt.
18 Dixeruntque principes Galaad singuli ad proximos suos: Qui primus ex nobis contra filios Ammon cœperit dimicare, erit dux populi Galaad.

11 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ οὐχὶ οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι καὶ οἱ Αμορραῖοι καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων καὶ Μωαβ καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι
12 καὶ Σιδώνιοι καὶ Μαδιαμ καὶ Αμαληκ ἐξέθλιψαν ὑμᾶς καὶ ἐκεκράξατε πρός με καὶ ἔσωσα ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῶν
13 καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐγκατελίπετέ με καὶ ἐλατρεύσατε θεοῖς ἑτέροις διὰ τοῦτο οὐ προσθήσω τοῦ σῶσαι ὑμᾶς
14 βαδίζετε καὶ βοᾶτε πρὸς τοὺς θεούς οὓς ἐξελέξασθε ἑαυτοῖς καὶ αὐτοὶ σωσάτωσαν ὑμᾶς ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως ὑμῶν

16 καὶ μετέστησαν τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ οὐκ εὐηρέστησεν ἐν τῷ λαῷ καὶ ὠλιγοψύχησεν ἐν τῷ κόπῳ Ισραηλ

17 καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν Γαλααδ καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν τῇ Μασσηφα
18 καὶ εἶπον οἱ ἄρχοντες τοῦ λαοῦ Γαλααδ ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ τίς ἀνήρ ὃς ἄρξεται πολεμῆσαι ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Αμμων καὶ ἔσται εἰς κεφαλὴν πᾶσιν τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Γαλααδ
