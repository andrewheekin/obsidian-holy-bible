# Book of Judges 7 (RSVCE)

### Gideon Surprises and Routs the Midianites
1 Then Jerubbaʹal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midʹian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
2 TheLordsaid to Gideon, “The people with you are too many for me to give the Midʹianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, ‘My own hand has delivered me.’
3 Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home.’ ” And Gideon tested them; twenty-two thousand returned, and ten thousand remained.
4 And theLordsaid to Gideon, “The people are still too many; take them down to the water and I will test them for you there; and he of whom I say to you, ‘This man shall go with you,’ shall go with you; and any of whom I say to you, ‘This man shall not go with you,’ shall not go.”
5 So he brought the people down to the water; and theLordsaid to Gideon, “Every one that laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself; likewise every one that kneels down to drink.”
6 And the number of those that lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.
7 And theLordsaid to Gideon, “With the three hundred men that lapped I will deliver you, and give the Midʹianites into your hand; and let all the others go every man to his home.”
8 So he took the jars of the people from their hands, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midʹian was below him in the valley.
9 That same night theLordsaid to him, “Arise, go down against the camp; for I have given it into your hand.
10 But if you fear to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant;
11 and you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp.” Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men that were in the camp.
12 And the Midʹianites and the Amalʹekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the seashore for multitude.
13 When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade; and he said, “Behold, I dreamed a dream; and lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midʹian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.”
14 And his comrade answered, “This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joʹash, a man of Israel; into his hand God has given Midʹian and all the host.”
15 When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped; and he returned to the camp of Israel, and said, “Arise; for theLordhas given the host of Midʹian into your hand.”
16 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars.
17 And he said to them, “Look at me, and do likewise; when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.
18 When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, ‘For theLordand for Gideon.’ ”
19 So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands.
20 And the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars, holding in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow; and they cried, “A sword for theLordand for Gideon!”
21 They stood every man in his place round about the camp, and all the army ran; they cried out and fled.
22 When they blew the three hundred trumpets, theLordset every man’s sword against his fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shitʹtah toward Zerʹerah, as far as the border of Aʹbel-mehoʹlah, by Tabbath.
23 And the men of Israel were called out from Naphʹtali and from Asher and from all Manasʹseh, and they pursued after Midʹian.
24 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Eʹphraim, saying, “Come down against the Midʹianites and seize the waters against them, as far as Beth-barʹah, and also the Jordan.” So all the men of Eʹphraim were called out, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-barʹah, and also the Jordan.
25 And they took the two princes of Midʹian, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the wine press of Zeeb, as they pursued Midʹian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.


# Liber Judicum 7 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Igitur Jerobaal qui et Gedeon, de nocte consurgens, et omnis populus cum eo, venit ad fontem qui vocatur Harad. Erant autem castra Madian in valle ad septentrionalem plagam collis excelsi.
2 Dixitque Dominus ad Gedeon: Multus tecum est populus, nec tradetur Madian in manus ejus: ne glorietur contra me Israël, et dicat: Meis viribus liberatus sum.
3 Loquere ad populum, et cunctis audientibus prædica: Qui formidolosus et timidus est, revertatur. Recesseruntque de monte Galaad, et reversi sunt de populo viginti duo millia virorum, et tantum decem millia remanserunt.
4 Dixitque Dominus ad Gedeon: Adhuc populus multus est: duc eos ad aquas et ibi probabo illos: et de quo dixero tibi ut tecum vadat, ipse pergat; quem ire prohibuero, revertatur.
5 Cumque descendisset populus ad aquas, dixit Dominus ad Gedeon: Qui lingua lambuerint aquas, sicut solent canes lambere, separabis eos seorsum: qui autem curvatis genibus biberint, in altera parte erunt.
6 Fuit itaque numerus eorum qui manu ad os projiciente lambuerunt aquas, trecenti viri: omnis autem reliqua multitudo flexo poplite biberat.
7 Et ait Dominus ad Gedeon: In trecentis viris qui lambuerunt aquas, liberabo vos, et tradam in manu tua Madian: omnis autem reliqua multitudo revertatur in locum suum.
8 Sumptis itaque pro numero cibariis et tubis, omnem reliquam multitudinem abire præcepit ad tabernacula sua: et ipse cum trecentis viris se certamini dedit. Castra autem Madian erant subter in valle.
9 Eadem nocte dixit Dominus ad eum: Surge, et descende in castra: quia tradidi eos in manu tua.
10 Sin autem solus ire formidas, descendat tecum Phara puer tuus.
11 Et cum audieris quid loquantur, tunc confortabuntur manus tuæ, et securior ad hostium castra descendes. Descendit ergo ipse et Phara puer ejus in partem castrorum, ubi erant armatorum vigiliæ.
12 Madian autem et Amalec, et omnes orientales populi, fusi jacebant in valle, ut locustarum multitudo: cameli quoque innumerabiles erant, sicut arena quæ jacet in littore maris.
13 Cumque venisset Gedeon, narrabat aliquis somnium proximo suo: et in hunc modum referebat quod viderat: Vidi somnium, et videbatur mihi quasi subcinericius panis ex hordeo volvi, et in castra Madian descendere: cumque pervenisset ad tabernaculum, percussit illud, atque subvertit, et terræ funditus coæquavit.
14 Respondit is, cui loquebatur: Non est hoc aliud, nisi gladius Gedeonis filii Joas viri Israëlitæ: tradidit enim Dominus in manus ejus Madian, et omnia castra ejus.

15 Cumque audisset Gedeon somnium, et interpretationem ejus, adoravit: et reversus est ad castra Israël, et ait: Surgite, tradidit enim Dominus in manus nostras castra Madian.
16 Divisitque trecentos viros in tres partes, et dedit tubas in manibus eorum, lagenasque vacuas, ac lampades in medio lagenarum.
17 Et dixit ad eos: Quod me facere videritis, hoc facite: ingrediar partem castrorum, et quod fecero, sectamini.
18 Quando personuerit tuba in manu mea, vos quoque per castrorum circuitum clangite, et conclamate: Domino et Gedeoni.
19 Ingressusque est Gedeon, et trecenti viri qui erant cum eo, in partem castrorum, incipientibus vigiliis noctis mediæ: et custodibus suscitatis, cœperunt buccinis clangere, et complodere inter se lagenas.
20 Cumque per gyrum castrorum in tribus personarent locis, et hydrias confregissent, tenuerunt sinistris manibus lampades, et dextris sonantes tubas, clamaveruntque: Gladius Domini et Gedeonis:

21 stantes singuli in loco suo per circuitum castrorum hostilium. Omnia itaque castra turbata sunt, et vociferantes ululantesque fugerunt:
22 et nihilominus insistebant trecenti viri buccinis personantes. Immisitque Dominus gladium omnibus castris, et mutua se cæde truncabant,
23 fugientes usque ad Bethsetta, et crepidinem Abelmehula in Tebbath. Conclamantes autem viri Israël de Nephthali, et Aser, et omni Manasse, persequebantur Madian.
24 Misitque Gedeon nuntios in omnem montem Ephraim, dicens: Descendite in occursum Madian, et occupate aquas usque Bethbera atque Jordanem. Clamavitque omnis Ephraim, et præoccupavit aquas atque Jordanem usque Bethbera.
25 Apprehensosque duos viros Madian, Oreb et Zeb, interfecit Oreb in petra Oreb, Zeb vero in torculari Zeb. Et persecuti sunt Madian, capita Oreb et Zeb portantes ad Gedeon trans fluenta Jordanis.

1 καὶ ὤρθρισεν Ιεροβααλ αὐτός ἐστιν Γεδεων καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν Αρωεδ καὶ παρεμβολὴ Μαδιαμ καὶ Αμαληκ ἦν αὐτῷ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἀπὸ τοῦ βουνοῦ τοῦ Αβωρ ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι
2 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Γεδεων πολὺς ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετὰ σοῦ ὥστε μὴ παραδοῦναί με τὴν Μαδιαμ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτῶν μήποτε καυχήσηται Ισραηλ ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ λέγων ἡ χείρ μου ἔσωσέν με
3 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν λάλησον δὴ εἰς τὰ ὦτα τοῦ λαοῦ λέγων τίς δειλὸς καὶ φοβούμενος ἀποστραφήτω καὶ ἐξώρμησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ Γαλααδ καὶ ἀπεστράφησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ εἴκοσι καὶ δύο χιλιάδες καὶ δέκα χιλιάδες ὑπελείφθησαν

5 καὶ κατεβίβασεν τὸν λαὸν εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Γεδεων πᾶς ὃς ἂν λάψῃ τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος ὡς ἐὰν λάψῃ ὁ κύων στήσεις αὐτὸν κατὰ μόνας καὶ πᾶς ὃς ἂν κάμψῃ ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατα αὐτοῦ τοῦ πιεῖν μεταστήσεις αὐτὸν κα{Q'} αὑτόν
6 καὶ ἐγένετο πᾶς ὁ ἀριθμὸς τῶν λαψάντων ἐν τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐτῶν τριακόσιοι ἄνδρες καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἐπίλοιπος τοῦ λαοῦ ἔκαμψαν ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατα αὐτῶν τοῦ πιεῖν ὕδωρ
7 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Γεδεων ἐν τοῖς τριακοσίοις ἀνδράσιν τοῖς λάψασιν σώσω ὑμᾶς καὶ παραδώσω τὴν Μαδιαμ ἐν χειρί σου καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἀποτρεχέτω ἀνὴρ εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ
8 καὶ ἔλαβον τὸν ἐπισιτισμὸν τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς κερατίνας αὐτῶν καὶ πάντα ἄνδρα Ισραηλ ἐξαπέστειλεν ἄνδρα εἰς τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ τῶν δὲ τριακοσίων ἀνδρῶν ἐκράτησεν ἡ δὲ παρεμβολὴ Μαδιαμ ἦν ὑποκάτωθεν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι
9 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν κύριος ἀνάστα κατάβηθι τὸ τάχος ἐντεῦθεν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν ὅτι παρέδωκα αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ χειρί σου
10 εἰ δὲ φοβῇ σὺ καταβῆναι κατάβηθι σὺ καὶ Φαρα τὸ παιδάριόν σου εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν
11 καὶ ἀκούσῃ τί λαλοῦσιν καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἰσχύσουσιν αἱ χεῖρές σου καὶ καταβήσῃ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ καὶ κατέβη αὐτὸς καὶ Φαρα τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ εἰς μέρος τῶν πεντήκοντα τῶν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ
12 καὶ Μαδιαμ καὶ Αμαληκ καὶ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ ἀνατολῶν παρεμβεβλήκεισαν ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι ὡς ἀκρὶς εἰς πλῆθος καὶ ταῖς καμήλοις αὐτῶν οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμός ἀλ{L'} ἦσαν ὥσπερ ἡ ἄμμος ἡ ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖλος τῆς θαλάσσης εἰς πλῆθος

14 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ πλησίον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν οὐκ ἔστιν αὕτη ἀλ{L'} ἢ ῥομφαία Γεδεων υἱοῦ Ιωας ἀνδρὸς Ισραηλ παρέδωκεν κύριος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὴν Μαδιαμ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν παρεμβολήν

15 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Γεδεων τὴν διήγησιν τοῦ ἐνυπνίου καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ καὶ προσεκύνησεν κύριον καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν ἀνάστητε ὅτι παρέδωκεν κύριος ἐν χερσὶν ὑμῶν τὴν παρεμβολὴν Μαδιαμ
16 καὶ διεῖλεν τοὺς τριακοσίους ἄνδρας τρεῖς ἀρχὰς καὶ ἔδωκεν κερατίνας ἐν χειρὶ πάντων καὶ ὑδρίας κενὰς καὶ λαμπάδας ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ὑδριῶν
17 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ ὄψεσθε καὶ οὕτως ποιήσετε καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ εἰσπορεύομαι ἐν μέσῳ τῆς παρεμβολῆς καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἐὰν ποιήσω οὕτως ποιήσετε
