# Book of Judges 18 (RSVCE)

### The Migration of Dan
1 In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in; for until then no inheritance among the tribes of Israel had fallen to them.
2 So the Danites sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe, from Zorah and from Eshʹta-ol, to spy out the land and to explore it; and they said to them, “Go and explore the land.” And they came to the hill country of Eʹphraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
3 When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; and they turned aside and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?”
4 And he said to them, “Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me: he has hired me, and I have become his priest.”
5 And they said to him, “Inquire of God, we pray thee, that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed.”
6 And the priest said to them, “Go in peace. The journey on which you go is under the eye of theLord.”
7 Then the five men departed, and came to Laʹish, and saw the people who were there, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Sidoʹnians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing that is in the earth, and possessing wealth, and how they were far from the Sidoʹnians and had no dealings with any one.
8 And when they came to their brethren at Zorah and Eshʹta-ol, their brethren said to them, “What do you report?”
9 They said, “Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very fertile. And will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, and enter in and possess the land.
10 When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is broad; yea, God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.”
11 And six hundred men of the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set forth from Zorah and Eshʹta-ol,
12 and went up and encamped at Kirʹiath-jeʹarim in Judah. On this account that place is called Maʹhaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kirʹiath-jeʹarim.
13 And they passed on from there to the hill country of Eʹphraim, and came to the house of Micah.
14 Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of Laʹish said to their brethren, “Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, terʹaphim, a graven image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you will do.”
15 And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.
16 Now the six hundred men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate;
17 and the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up, and entered and took the graven image, the ephod, the terʹaphim, and the molten image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.
18 And when these went into Micah’s house and took the graven image, the ephod, the terʹaphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
19 And they said to him, “Keep quiet, put your hand upon your mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and family in Israel?”
20 And the priest’s heart was glad; he took the ephod, and the terʹaphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
21 So they turned and departed, putting the little ones and the cattle and the goods in front of them.
22 When they were a good way from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house were called out, and they overtook the Danites.
23 And they shouted to the Danites, who turned round and said to Micah, “What ails you that you come with such a company?”
24 And he said, “You take my gods which I made, and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then do you ask me, ‘What ails you?’ ”
25 And the Danites said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.”
26 Then the Danites went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.
### The Danites Settle in Laish
27 And taking what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, the Danites came to Laʹish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and burned the city with fire.
28 And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any one. It was in the valley which belongs to Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city, and dwelt in it.
29 And they named the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was Laʹish at the first.
30 And the Danites set up the graven image for themselves; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
31 So they set up Micah’s graven image which he made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.


# Liber Judicum 18 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In diebus illis non erat rex in Israël, et tribus Dan quærebat possessionem sibi, ut habitaret in ea: usque ad illum enim diem inter ceteras tribus sortem non acceperat.
2 Miserunt ergo filii Dan stirpis et familiæ suæ quinque viros fortissimos de Saraa et Esthaol, ut explorarent terram, et diligenter inspicerent: dixeruntque eis: Ite, et considerate terram. Qui cum pergentes venissent in montem Ephraim, et intrassent domum Michæ, requieverunt ibi:
3 et agnoscentes vocem adolescentis Levitæ, utentesque illius diversorio, dixerunt ad eum: Quis te huc adducit? quid hic agis? quam ob causam huc venire voluisti?
4 Qui respondit eis: Hæc et hæc præstitit mihi Michas, et me mercede conduxit, ut sim ei sacerdos.
5 Rogaverunt autem eum ut consuleret Dominum ut scire possent an prospero itinere pergerent, et res haberet effectum.
6 Qui respondit eis: Ite in pace: Dominus respicit viam vestram, et iter quo pergitis.

7 Euntes igitur quinque viri venerunt Lais: videruntque populum habitantem in ea absque ullo timore, juxta consuetudinem Sidoniorum, securum et quietum, nullo ei penitus resistente, magnarumque opum, et procul a Sidone atque a cunctis hominibus separatum.
8 Reversique ad fratres suos in Saraa et Esthaol, et quid egissent sciscitantibus responderunt:
9 Surgite, ascendamus ad eos: vidimus enim terram valde opulentam et uberem. Nolite negligere, nolite cessare: eamus, et possideamus eam: nullus erit labor.
10 Intrabimus ad securos, in regionem latissimam, tradetque nobis Dominus locum, in quo nullius rei est penuria eorum quæ gignuntur in terra.

11 Profecti igitur sunt de cognatione Dan, id est, de Saraa et Esthaol, sexcenti viri accincti armis bellicis,
12 ascendentesque manserunt in Cariathiarim Judæ: qui locus ex eo tempore Castrorum Dan nomen accepit, et est post tergum Cariathiarim.
13 Inde transierunt in montem Ephraim. Cumque venissent ad domum Michæ,
14 dixerunt quinque viri, qui prius missi fuerant ad considerandam terram Lais, ceteris fratribus suis: Nostis quod in domibus istis sit ephod, et theraphim, et sculptile, atque conflatile: videte quid vobis placeat.
15 Et cum paululum declinassent, ingressi sunt domum adolescentis Levitæ, qui erat in domo Michæ: salutaveruntque eum verbis pacificis.
16 Sexcenti autem viri ita ut erant armati, stabant ante ostium.
17 At illi, qui ingressi fuerant domum juvenis, sculptile, et ephod, et theraphim, atque conflatile tollere nitebantur, et sacerdos stabat ante ostium, sexcentis viris fortissimis haud procul expectantibus.
18 Tulerunt igitur qui intraverant sculptile, ephod, et idola, atque conflatile. Quibus dixit sacerdos: Quid facitis?
19 Cui responderunt: Tace et pone digitum super os tuum: venique nobiscum, ut habeamus te patrem, ac sacerdotem. Quid tibi melius est, ut sis sacerdos in domo unius viri, an in una tribu et familia in Israël?
20 Quod cum audisset, acquievit sermonibus eorum, et tulit ephod, et idola, ac sculptile, et profectus est cum eis.

21 Qui cum pergerent, et ante se ire fecissent parvulos ac jumenta, et omne quod erat pretiosum,
22 et jam a domo Michæ essent procul, viri qui habitabant in ædibus Michæ conclamantes secuti sunt,
23 et post tergum clamare cœperunt. Qui cum respexissent, dixerunt ad Micham: Quid tibi vis? cur clamas?
24 Qui respondit: Deos meos, quos mihi feci, tulistis, et sacerdotem, et omnia quæ habeo, et dicitis: Quid tibi est?
25 Dixeruntque ei filii Dan: Cave ne ultra loquaris ad nos, et veniant ad te viri animo concitati, et ipse cum omni domo tua pereas.
26 Et sic cœpto itinere perrexerunt. Videns autem Michas quod fortiores se essent, reversus est in domum suam.

27 Sexcenti autem viri tulerunt sacerdotem, et quæ supra diximus: veneruntque in Lais ad populum quiescentem atque securum, et percusserunt eos in ore gladii: urbemque incendio tradiderunt,
28 nullo penitus ferente præsidium, eo quod procul habitarent a Sidone, et cum nullo hominum haberent quidquam societatis ac negotii. Erat autem civitas sita in regione Rohob: quam rursum exstruentes habitaverunt in ea,
29 vocato nomine civitatis Dan, juxta vocabulum patris sui, quem genuerat Israël, quæ prius Lais dicebatur.
30 Posueruntque sibi sculptile, et Jonathan filium Gersam filii Moysi ac filios ejus sacerdotes in tribu Dan, usque ad diem captivitatis suæ.
31 Mansitque apud eos idolum Michæ omni tempore quo fuit domus Dei in Silo. In diebus illis non erat rex in Israël.

11 καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ συγγενείας τοῦ Δαν ἐκ Σαραα καὶ Εσθαολ ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες περιεζωσμένοι σκεύη πολεμικά
12 καὶ ἀνέβησαν καὶ παρενεβάλοσαν ἐν Καριαθιαριμ ἐν Ιουδα διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τῷ τόπῳ ἐκείνῳ Παρεμβολὴ Δαν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης ἰδοὺ κατόπισθεν Καριαθιαριμ

15 καὶ ἐξέκλιναν ἐκεῖ καὶ εἰσήλθοσαν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ παιδαρίου τοῦ Λευίτου εἰς τὸν οἶκον Μιχα καὶ ἠσπάσαντο αὐτόν

29 καὶ ἐκάλεσαν τὸ ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως Δαν κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν ὃς ἐγενήθη τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ ἦν Λαις ὄνομα τῇ πόλει τὸ πρότερον
30 καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἑαυτοῖς οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ Δαν τὸ γλυπτὸν Μιχα καὶ Ιωναθαν υἱὸς Γηρσωμ υἱοῦ Μωυσῆ αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἦσαν ἱερεῖς τῇ φυλῇ Δαν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς μετοικεσίας τῆς γῆς
31 καὶ ἔταξαν ἑαυτοῖς τὸ γλυπτὸν Μιχα ὃ ἐποίησεν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ὅσας ἦν ὁ οἶκος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν Σηλω
