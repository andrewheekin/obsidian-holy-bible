# Book of Judges 4 (RSVCE)

### Deborah and Barak
1 And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of theLord, after Ehud died.
2 And theLordsold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the commander of his army was Sisʹera, who dwelt in Haroʹsheth-ha-goiʹim.
3 Then the people of Israel cried to theLordfor help; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years.
4 Now Debʹorah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapʹpidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
5 She used to sit under the palm of Debʹorah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Eʹphraim; and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment.
6 She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinʹo-am from Kedesh in Naphʹtali, and said to him, “TheLord, the God of Israel, commands you, ‘Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking ten thousand from the tribe of Naphʹtali and the tribe of Zebʹulun.
7 And I will draw out Sisʹera, the general of Jabin’s army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops; and I will give him into your hand.’ ”
8 Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”
9 And she said, “I will surely go with you; nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for theLordwill sell Sisʹera into the hand of a woman.” Then Debʹorah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
10 And Barak summoned Zebʹulun and Naphʹtali to Kedesh; and ten thousand men went up at his heels; and Debʹorah went up with him.
11 Now Heber the Kenʹite had separated from the Kenʹites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Za-ananʹnim, which is near Kedesh.
12 When Sisʹera was told that Barak the son of Abinʹo-am had gone up to Mount Tabor,
13 Sisʹera called out all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Haroʹsheth-ha-goiʹim to the river Kishon.
14 And Debʹorah said to Barak, “Up! For this is the day in which theLordhas given Sisʹera into your hand. Does not theLordgo out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.
15 And theLordrouted Sisʹera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak at the edge of the sword; and Sisʹera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.
16 And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Haroʹsheth-ha-goiʹim, and all the army of Sisʹera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.
17 But Sisʹera fled away on foot to the tent of Jaʹel, the wife of Heber the Kenʹite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenʹite.
18 And Jaʹel came out to meet Sisʹera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; have no fear.” So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
19 And he said to her, “Pray, give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.
20 And he said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, ‘Is any one here?’ say, No.”
21 But Jaʹel the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, till it went down into the ground, as he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died.
22 And behold, as Barak pursued Sisʹera, Jaʹel went out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” So he went in to her tent; and there lay Sisʹera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.
23 So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel.
24 And the hand of the people of Israel bore harder and harder on Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.


# Liber Judicum 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Addideruntque filii Israël facere malum in conspectu Domini post mortem Aod,
2 et tradidit illos Dominus in manus Jabin regis Chanaan, qui regnavit in Asor: habuitque ducem exercitus sui nomine Sisaram, ipse autem habitabat in Haroseth gentium.
3 Clamaveruntque filii Israël ad Dominum: nongentos enim habebat falcatos currus, et per viginti annos vehementer oppresserat eos.

4 Erat autem Debbora prophetis uxor Lapidoth, quæ judicabat populum in illo tempore.
5 Et sedebat sub palma, quæ nomine illius vocabatur, inter Rama et Bethel in monte Ephraim: ascendebantque ad eam filii Israël in omne judicium.
6 Quæ misit et vocavit Barac filium Abinoëm de Cedes Nephthali: dixitque ad eum: Præcepit tibi Dominus Deus Israël: Vade, et duc exercitum in montem Thabor, tollesque tecum decem millia pugnatorum de filiis Nephthali, et de filiis Zabulon:
7 ego autem adducam ad te in loco torrentis Cison, Sisaram principem exercitus Jabin, et currus ejus, atque omnem multitudinem, et tradam eos in manu tua.

8 Dixitque ad eam Barac: Si venis mecum, vadam: si nolueris venire mecum, non pergam.
9 Quæ dixit ad eum: Ibo quidem tecum, sed in hac vice victoria non reputabitur tibi, quia in manu mulieris tradetur Sisara. Surrexit itaque Debbora, et perrexit cum Barac in Cedes.
10 Qui, accitis Zabulon et Nephthali, ascendit cum decem millibus pugnatorum, habens Debboram in comitatu suo.
11 Haber autem Cinæus recesserat quondam a ceteris Cinæis fratribus suis, filiis Hobab cognati Moysi: et tetenderat tabernacula usque ad vallem, quæ vocatur Sennim, et erat juxta Cedes.

12 Nuntiatumque est Sisaræ quod ascendisset Barac filius Abinoëm in montem Thabor:
13 et congregavit nongentos falcatos currus, et omnem exercitum de Haroseth gentium ad torrentem Cison.
14 Dixitque Debbora ad Barac: Surge, hæc est enim dies, in qua tradidit Dominus Sisaram in manus tuas: en ipse ductor est tuus. Descendit itaque Barac de monte Thabor, et decem millia pugnatorum cum eo.
15 Perterruitque Dominus Sisaram, et omnes currus ejus, universamque multitudinem in ore gladii ad conspectum Barac: in tantum, ut Sisara de curru desiliens, pedibus fugeret,
16 et Barac persequeretur fugientes currus, et exercitum usque ad Haroseth gentium, et omnis hostium multitudo usque ad internecionem caderet.

17 Sisara autem fugiens pervenit ad tentorium Jahel uxoris Haber Cinæi. Erat enim pax inter Jabin regem Asor, et domum Haber Cinæi.
18 Egressa igitur Jahel in occursum Sisaræ, dixit ad eum: Intra ad me, domine mi: intra, ne timeas. Qui ingressus tabernaculum ejus, et opertus ab ea pallio,
19 dixit ad eam: Da mihi, obsecro, paululum aquæ, quia sitio valde. Quæ aperuit utrem lactis, et dedit ei bibere, et operuit illum.
20 Dixitque Sisara ad eam: Sta ante ostium tabernaculi: et cum venerit aliquis interrogans te, et dicens: Numquid hic est aliquis? respondebis: Nullus est.
21 Tulit itaque Jahel uxor Haber clavum tabernaculi, assumens pariter et malleum: et ingressa abscondite et cum silentio, posuit supra tempus capitis ejus clavum, percussumque malleo defixit in cerebrum usque ad terram: qui soporem morti consocians defecit, et mortuus est.

22 Et ecce Barac sequens Sisaram veniebat: egressaque Jahel in occursum ejus, dixit ei: Veni, et ostendam tibi virum quem quæris. Qui cum intrasset ad eam, vidit Sisaram jacentem mortuum, et clavum infixum in tempore ejus.
23 Humiliavit ergo Deus in die illo Jabin regem Chanaan coram filiis Israël:
24 qui crescebant quotidie, et forti manu opprimebant Jabin regem Chanaan, donec delerent eum.

1 καὶ προσέθεντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι κυρίου
2 καὶ ἀπέδοτο αὐτοὺς κύριος ἐν χειρὶ Ιαβιν βασιλέως Χανααν ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ασωρ καὶ ὁ ἄρχων τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ Σισαρα καὶ αὐτὸς κατῴκει ἐν Αρισωθ τῶν ἐθνῶν
3 καὶ ἐκέκραξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πρὸς κύριον ὅτι ἐννακόσια ἅρματα σιδηρᾶ ἦν αὐτῷ καὶ αὐτὸς ἔθλιψεν τὸν Ισραηλ κατὰ κράτος εἴκοσι ἔτη

4 καὶ Δεββωρα γυνὴ προφῆτις γυνὴ Λαφιδωθ αὐτὴ ἔκρινεν τὸν Ισραηλ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ
5 καὶ αὐτὴ ἐκάθητο ὑπὸ φοίνικα Δεββωρα ἀνὰ μέσον Ραμα καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Βαιθηλ ἐν ὄρει Εφραιμ καὶ ἀνέβαινον πρὸς αὐτὴν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἐκεῖ τοῦ κρίνεσθαι
6 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δεββωρα καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸν Βαρακ υἱὸν Αβινεεμ ἐκ Κεδες Νεφθαλι καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν οὐχὶ σοὶ ἐνετείλατο κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ καὶ ἀπελεύσῃ εἰς ὄρος Θαβωρ καὶ λήμψῃ μετὰ σεαυτοῦ δέκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Νεφθαλι καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ζαβουλων
7 καὶ ἀπάξω πρὸς σὲ εἰς τὸν χειμάρρουν Κισων τὸν Σισαρα ἄρχοντα τῆς δυνάμεως Ιαβιν καὶ τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ πλῆθος αὐτοῦ καὶ παραδώσω αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ χειρί σου

8 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὴν Βαρακ ἐὰν πορευθῇς με{T'} ἐμοῦ πορεύσομαι καὶ ἐὰν μὴ πορευθῇς με{T'} ἐμοῦ οὐ πορεύσομαι ὅτι οὐκ οἶδα τὴν ἡμέραν ἐν ᾗ εὐοδοῖ κύριος τὸν ἄγγελον με{T'} ἐμοῦ
9 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Δεββωρα πορευομένη πορεύσομαι μετὰ σοῦ πλὴν γίνωσκε ὅτι οὐκ ἔσται τὸ προτέρημά σου εἰς τὴν ὁδόν ἣν σὺ πορεύῃ ὅτι ἐν χειρὶ γυναικὸς ἀποδώσεται κύριος τὸν Σισαρα καὶ ἀνέστη Δεββωρα καὶ ἐπορεύθη μετὰ τοῦ Βαρακ εἰς Κεδες
10 καὶ παρήγγειλεν Βαρακ τῷ Ζαβουλων καὶ τῷ Νεφθαλι εἰς Κεδες καὶ ἀνέβησαν κατὰ πόδας αὐτοῦ δέκα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν καὶ Δεββωρα ἀνέβη με{T'} αὐτοῦ
11 καὶ οἱ πλησίον τοῦ Κιναίου ἐχωρίσθησαν ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ιωβαβ γαμβροῦ Μωυσῆ καὶ ἔπηξεν τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ πρὸς δρῦν ἀναπαυομένων ἥ ἐστιν ἐχόμενα Κεδες

12 καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ Σισαρα ὅτι ἀνέβη Βαρακ υἱὸς Αβινεεμ ἐ{P'} ὄρος Θαβωρ
13 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Σισαρα πάντα τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐννακόσια ἅρματα σιδηρᾶ ἦν αὐτῷ καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν τὸν με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ Αρισωθ τῶν ἐθνῶν εἰς τὸν χειμάρρουν Κισων
14 καὶ εἶπεν Δεββωρα πρὸς Βαρακ ἀνάστηθι ὅτι αὕτη ἡ ἡμέρα ἐν ᾗ παρέδωκεν κύριος τὸν Σισαρα ἐν χειρί σου οὐκ ἰδοὺ κύριος ἐλεύσεται ἔμπροσθέν σου καὶ κατέβη Βαρακ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους Θαβωρ καὶ δέκα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ ἐξέστησεν κύριος τὸν Σισαρα καὶ πάντα τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν παρεμβολὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας ἐνώπιον Βαρακ καὶ κατέβη Σισαρα ἀπὸ τοῦ ἅρματος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφυγεν τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ
16 καὶ Βαρακ διώκων ὀπίσω τῶν ἁρμάτων καὶ ὀπίσω τῆς παρεμβολῆς ἕως δρυμοῦ τῶν ἐθνῶν καὶ ἔπεσεν πᾶσα ἡ παρεμβολὴ Σισαρα ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας οὐ κατελείφθη ἕως ἑνός

17 καὶ Σισαρα ἀνεχώρησεν τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ εἰς σκηνὴν Ιαηλ γυναικὸς Χαβερ τοῦ Κιναίου ὅτι εἰρήνη ἀνὰ μέσον Ιαβιν βασιλέως Ασωρ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον οἴκου Χαβερ τοῦ Κιναίου
18 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ιαηλ εἰς ἀπάντησιν Σισαρα καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν ἔκνευσον κύριέ μου ἔκνευσον πρός με μὴ φοβοῦ καὶ ἐξένευσεν πρὸς αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν σκηνήν καὶ συνεκάλυψεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ δέρρει αὐτῆς
19 καὶ εἶπεν Σισαρα πρὸς αὐτήν πότισόν με δὴ μικρὸν ὕδωρ ὅτι ἐδίψησα καὶ ἤνοιξεν τὸν ἀσκὸν τοῦ γάλακτος καὶ ἐπότισεν αὐτὸν καὶ συνεκάλυψεν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ
20 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτήν στῆθι ἐν τῇ θύρᾳ τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ ἔσται ἐάν τις ἔλθῃ πρὸς σὲ καὶ ἐρωτήσῃ σε καὶ εἴπῃ σοι ἔστιν ἐνταῦθα ἀνήρ καὶ ἐρεῖς οὐκ ἔστιν καὶ συνεκάλυψεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ δέρρει αὐτῆς
21 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ιαηλ γυνὴ Χαβερ τὸν πάσσαλον τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ ἔθηκεν τὴν σφῦραν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτῆς καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἡσυχῇ καὶ ἐνέκρουσεν τὸν πάσσαλον ἐν τῇ γνάθῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ διήλασεν ἐν τῇ γῇ καὶ αὐτὸς ἀπεσκάρισεν ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν γονάτων αὐτῆς καὶ ἐξέψυξεν καὶ ἀπέθανεν

22 καὶ ἰδοὺ Βαρακ διώκων τὸν Σισαρα καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ιαηλ εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ δεῦρο καὶ δείξω σοι τὸν ἄνδρα ὃν σὺ ζητεῖς καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτήν καὶ ἰδοὺ Σισαρα πεπτωκὼς νεκρός καὶ ὁ πάσσαλος ἐν τῇ γνάθῳ αὐτοῦ
23 καὶ ἐταπείνωσεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς τὸν Ιαβιν βασιλέα Χανααν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐνώπιον υἱῶν Ισραηλ
24 καὶ ἐπορεύθη χεὶρ τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ πορευομένη καὶ σκληρυνομένη ἐπὶ Ιαβιν βασιλέα Χανααν ἕως ἐξωλέθρευσαν αὐτόν
