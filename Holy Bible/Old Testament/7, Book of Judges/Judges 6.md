# Book of Judges 6 (RSVCE)

### The Midianite Oppression
1 The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of heLord; and theLordgave them into the hand of Midʹian seven years.
2 And the hand of Midʹian prevailed over Israel; and because of Midʹian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves and the strongholds.
3 For whenever the Israelites put in seed the Midʹianites and the Amalʹekites and the people of the East would come up and attack them;
4 they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the land, as far as the neighborhood of Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel, and no sheep or ox or ass.
5 For they would come up with their cattle and their tents, coming like locusts for number; both they and their camels could not be counted; so that they wasted the land as they came in.
6 And Israel was brought very low because of Midʹian; and the people of Israel cried for help to theLord.
7 When the people of Israel cried to theLordon account of the Midʹianites,
8 theLordsent a prophet to the people of Israel; and he said to them, “Thus says theLord, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage;
9 and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you, and gave you their land;
10 and I said to you, ‘I am theLordyour God; you shall not pay reverence to the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.’ But you have not given heed to my voice.”
### The Call of Gideon
11 Now the angel of theLordcame and sat under the oak at Ophrah, which belonged to Joʹash the Abiezʹrite, as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midʹianites.
12 And the angel of theLordappeared to him and said to him, “TheLordis with you, you mighty man of valor.”
13 And Gideon said to him, “Pray, sir, if theLordis with us, why then has all this befallen us? And where are all his wonderful deeds which our fathers recounted to us, saying, ‘Did not theLordbring us up from Egypt?’ But now theLordhas cast us off, and given us into the hand of Midʹian.”
14 And theLordturned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours and deliver Israel from the hand of Midʹian; do not I send you?”
15 And he said to him, “Pray, Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasʹseh, and I am the least in my family.”
16 And theLordsaid to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall smite the Midʹianites as one man.”
17 And he said to him, “If now I have found favor with thee, then show me a sign that it is thou who speakest with me.
18 Do not depart from here, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring out my present, and set it before thee.” And he said, “I will stay till you return.”
19 So Gideon went into his house and prepared a kid, and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour; the meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the oak and presented them.
20 And the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.” And he did so.
21 Then the angel of theLordreached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and there sprang up fire from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of theLordvanished from his sight.
22 Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of theLord; and Gideon said, “Alas, O LordGod! For now I have seen the angel of theLordface to face.”
23 But theLordsaid to him, “Peace be to you; do not fear, you shall not die.”
24 Then Gideon built an altar there to theLord, and called it, TheLordis peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezʹrites.
25 That night theLordsaid to him, “Take your father’s bull, the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baʹal which your father has, and cut down the Asheʹrah that is beside it;
26 and build an altar to theLordyour God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order; then take the second bull, and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asheʹrah which you shall cut down.”
27 So Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as theLordhad told him; but because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night.
### Gideon Destroys the Altar of Baal
28 When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baʹal was broken down, and the Asheʹrah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered upon the altar which had been built.
29 And they said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” And after they had made search and inquired, they said, “Gideon the son of Joʹash has done this thing.”
30 Then the men of the town said to Joʹash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has pulled down the altar of Baʹal and cut down the Asheʹrah beside it.”
31 But Joʹash said to all who were arrayed against him, “Will you contend for Baʹal? Or will you defend his cause? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been pulled down.”
32 Therefore on that day he was called Jerubbaʹal, that is to say, “Let Baʹal contend against him,” because he pulled down his altar.
33 Then all the Midʹianites and the Amalʹekites and the people of the East came together, and crossing the Jordan they encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.
34 But the Spirit of theLordtook possession of Gideon; and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezʹrites were called out to follow him.
35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasʹseh; and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebʹulun, and Naphʹtali; and they went up to meet them.
### The Sign of the Fleece
36 Then Gideon said to God, “If thou wilt deliver Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,
37 behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that thou wilt deliver Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.”
38 And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.
39 Then Gideon said to God, “Let not thy anger burn against me, let me speak but this once; pray, let me make trial only this once with the fleece; pray, let it be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.”
40 And God did so that night; for it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.


# Liber Judicum 6 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Fecerunt autem filii Israël malum in conspectu Domini: qui tradidit illos in manu Madian septem annis,
2 et oppressi sunt valde ab eis. Feceruntque sibi antra et speluncas in montibus, et munitissima ad repugnandum loca.
3 Cumque sevisset Israël, ascendebat Madian et Amalec, ceterique orientalium nationum:
4 et apud eos figentes tentoria, sicut erant in herbis cuncta vastabant usque ad introitum Gazæ: nihilque omnino ad vitam pertinens relinquebant in Israël, non oves, non boves, non asinos.
5 Ipsi enim et universi greges eorum veniebant cum tabernaculis suis, et instar locustarum universa complebant, innumera multitudo hominum et camelorum, quidquid tetigerant devastantes.
6 Humiliatusque est Israël valde in conspectu Madian.
7 Et clamavit ad Dominum postulans auxilium contra Madianitas.
8 Qui misit ad eos virum prophetam, et locutus est: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Ego vos feci conscendere de Ægypto, et eduxi vos de domo servitutis,
9 et liberavi de manu Ægyptiorum, et omnium inimicorum qui affligebant vos: ejecique eos ad introitum vestrum, et tradidi vobis terram eorum.
10 Et dixi: Ego Dominus Deus vester: ne timeatis deos Amorrhæorum, in quorum terra habitatis. Et noluistis audire vocem meam.

11 Venit autem angelus Domini, et sedit sub quercu, quæ erat in Ephra, et pertinebat ad Joas patrem familiæ Ezri. Cumque Gedeon filius ejus excuteret atque purgaret frumenta in torculari, ut fugeret Madian,
12 apparuit ei angelus Domini, et ait: Dominus tecum, virorum fortissime.
13 Dixitque ei Gedeon: Obsecro, mi domine, si Dominus nobiscum est, cur apprehenderunt nos hæc omnia? ubi sunt mirabilia ejus, quæ narraverunt patres nostri, atque dixerunt: De Ægypto eduxit nos Dominus? nunc autem dereliquit nos Dominus, et tradidit in manu Madian.
14 Respexitque ad eum Dominus, et ait: Vade in hac fortitudine tua, et liberabis Israël de manu Madian: scito quod miserim te.
15 Qui respondens ait: Obsecro, mi domine, in quo liberabo Israël? ecce familia mea infima est in Manasse, et ego minimus in domo patris mei.
16 Dixitque ei Dominus: Ego ero tecum: et percuties Madian quasi unum virum.

17 Et ille: Si inveni, inquit, gratiam coram te, da mihi signum quod tu sis qui loqueris ad me:
18 nec recedas hinc, donec revertar ad te, portans sacrificium, et offerens tibi. Qui respondit: Ego præstolabor adventum tuum.
19 Ingressus est itaque Gedeon, et coxit hædum, et de farinæ modio azymos panes: carnesque ponens in canistro, et jus carnium mittens in ollam, tulit omnia sub quercu, et obtulit ei.
20 Cui dixit angelus Domini: Tolle carnes et azymos panes, et pone supra petram illam, et jus desuper funde. Cumque fecisset ita,
21 extendit angelus Domini summitatem virgæ, quam tenebat in manu, et tetigit carnes et panes azymos: ascenditque ignis de petra, et carnes azymosque panes consumpsit: angelus autem Domini evanuit ex oculis ejus.
22 Vidensque Gedeon quod esset angelus Domini, ait: Heu mi Domine Deus: quia vidi angelum Domini facie ad faciem.
23 Dixitque ei Dominus: Pax tecum: ne timeas, non morieris.
24 Ædificavit ergo ibi Gedeon altare Domino, vocavitque illud, Domini pax, usque in præsentem diem. Cumque adhuc esset in Ephra, quæ est familiæ Ezri,
25 nocte illa dixit Dominus ad eum: Tolle taurum patris tui, et alterum taurum annorum septem, destruesque aram Baal, quæ est patris tui, et nemus, quod circa aram est, succide.
26 Et ædificabis altare Domino Deo tuo in summitate petræ hujus, super quam ante sacrificium posuisti: tollesque taurum secundum, et offeres holocaustum super struem lignorum, quæ de nemore succideris.
27 Assumptis ergo Gedeon decem viris de servis suis, fecit sicut præceperat ei Dominus. Timens autem domum patris sui, et homines illius civitatis, per diem noluit id facere, sed omnia nocte complevit.
28 Cumque surrexissent viri oppidi ejus mane, viderunt destructam aram Baal, lucumque succisum, et taurum alterum impositum super altare, quod tunc ædificatum erat.
29 Dixeruntque ad invicem: Quis hoc fecit? Cumque perquirerent auctorem facti, dictum est: Gedeon filius Joas fecit hæc omnia.
30 Et dixerunt ad Joas: Produc filium tuum huc, ut moriatur: quia destruxit aram Baal, et succidit nemus.
31 Quibus ille respondit: Numquid ultores estis Baal, ut pugnetis pro eo? qui adversarius est ejus, moriatur antequam lux crastina veniat: si deus est, vindicet se de eo, qui suffodit aram ejus.
32 Ex illo die vocatus est Gedeon Jerobaal, eo quod dixisset Joas: Ulciscatur se de eo Baal, qui suffodit aram ejus.

33 Igitur omnis Madian, et Amalec, et orientales populi, congregati sunt simul: et transeuntes Jordanem, castrametati sunt in valle Jezraël.
34 Spiritus autem Domini induit Gedeon, qui clangens buccina convocavit domum Abiezer, ut sequeretur se.
35 Misitque nuntios in universum Manassen, qui et ipse secutus est eum: et alios nuntios in Aser et Zabulon et Nephthali, qui occurrerunt ei.
36 Dixitque Gedeon ad Deum: Si salvum facis per manum meam Israël, sicut locutus es,
37 ponam hoc vellus lanæ in area: si ros in solo vellere fuerit, et in omni terra siccitas, sciam quod per manum meam, sicut locutus es, liberabis Israël.
38 Factumque est ita. Et de nocte consurgens expresso vellere, concham rore implevit.
39 Dixitque rursus ad Deum: Ne irascatur furor tuus contra me si adhuc semel tentavero, signum quærens in vellere. Oro ut solum vellus siccum sit, et omnis terra rore madens.
40 Fecitque Deus nocte illa ut postulaverat: et fuit siccitas in solo vellere, et ros in omni terra.

1 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι κυρίου καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς κύριος ἐν χειρὶ Μαδιαμ ἔτη ἑπτά
2 καὶ κατίσχυσεν χεὶρ Μαδιαμ ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἀπὸ προσώπου Μαδιαμ μάνδρας ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν καὶ τοῖς σπηλαίοις καὶ τοῖς ὀχυρώμασιν
3 καὶ ἐγένετο ὅταν ἔσπειρεν ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ καὶ ἀνέβαινεν Μαδιαμ καὶ Αμαληκ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ ἀνατολῶν καὶ ἀνέβαινον ἐ{P'} αὐτόν
4 καὶ παρενέβαλλον ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς καὶ διέφθειραν τὰ ἐκφόρια τῆς γῆς ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς Γάζαν καὶ οὐχ ὑπελείποντο ὑπόστασιν ζωῆς ἐν Ισραηλ καὶ ποίμνιον καὶ μόσχον καὶ ὄνον
5 ὅτι αὐτοὶ καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν ἀνέβαινον καὶ τὰς σκηνὰς αὐτῶν παρέφερον καὶ παρεγίνοντο ὡς ἀκρὶς εἰς πλῆθος καὶ αὐτοῖς καὶ ταῖς καμήλοις αὐτῶν οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμός καὶ παρεγίνοντο ἐν τῇ γῇ Ισραηλ τοῦ διαφθείρειν αὐτήν
6 καὶ ἐπτώχευσεν Ισραηλ σφόδρα ἀπὸ προσώπου Μαδιαμ καὶ ἐκέκραξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πρὸς κύριον
7 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπεὶ ἐκέκραξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πρὸς κύριον διὰ Μαδιαμ
8 καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν κύριος ἄνδρα προφήτην πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς τάδε λέγει κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἀναβιβάσας ὑμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐξήγαγον ὑμᾶς ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας
9 καὶ ἐξειλάμην ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς πάντων τῶν θλιβόντων ὑμᾶς καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτοὺς ἐκ προσώπου ὑμῶν καὶ ἔδωκα ὑμῖν τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν
10 καὶ εἶπα ὑμῖν ἐγὼ κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν οὐ φοβηθήσεσθε τοὺς θεοὺς τοῦ Αμορραίου ἐν οἷς ὑμεῖς ἐνοικεῖτε ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς μου

11 καὶ ἦλθεν ἄγγελος κυρίου καὶ ἐκάθισεν ὑπὸ τὴν δρῦν τὴν οὖσαν ἐν Εφραθα τὴν τοῦ Ιωας πατρὸς Αβιεζρι καὶ Γεδεων ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἐρράβδιζεν πυροὺς ἐν ληνῷ τοῦ ἐκφυγεῖν ἐκ προσώπου Μαδιαμ
12 καὶ ὤφθη αὐτῷ ἄγγελος κυρίου καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν κύριος μετὰ σοῦ δυνατὸς τῇ ἰσχύι
13 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Γεδεων ἐν ἐμοί κύριε καὶ εἰ ἔστιν κύριος με{Q'} ἡμῶν ἵνα τί εὗρεν ἡμᾶς πάντα τὰ κακὰ ταῦτα καὶ ποῦ ἐστιν πάντα τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ ὅσα διηγήσαντο ἡμῖν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν λέγοντες οὐχὶ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἀνήγαγεν ἡμᾶς κύριος καὶ νῦν ἀπώσατο ἡμᾶς καὶ παρέδωκεν ἡμᾶς ἐν χειρὶ Μαδιαμ
14 καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ πορεύου ἐν τῇ ἰσχύι σου καὶ σώσεις τὸν Ισραηλ καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐξαπέστειλά σε
15 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Γεδεων ἐν ἐμοί κύριε ἐν τίνι σώσω τὸν Ισραηλ ἰδοὺ ἡ χιλιάς μου ταπεινοτέρα ἐν Μανασση καὶ ἐγώ εἰμι μικρὸς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός μου
16 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου κύριος ἔσται μετὰ σοῦ καὶ πατάξεις τὴν Μαδιαμ ὡσεὶ ἄνδρα ἕνα

17 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Γεδεων καὶ εἰ εὗρον χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου καὶ ποιήσεις μοι σημεῖον ὅτι σὺ λαλεῖς με{T'} ἐμοῦ
18 μὴ κινηθῇς ἐντεῦθεν ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν με πρὸς σέ καὶ οἴσω τὴν θυσίαν μου καὶ θήσω ἐνώπιόν σου καὶ εἶπεν ἐγώ εἰμι καθήσομαι ἕως τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι σε
19 καὶ Γεδεων εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ἐποίησεν ἔριφον αἰγῶν καὶ οιφι ἀλεύρου ἄζυμα καὶ τὰ κρέα ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸ κανοῦν καὶ τὸν ζωμὸν ἐνέχεεν εἰς χύτραν καὶ ἐξήνεγκεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τὴν δρῦν καὶ προσεκύνησεν
20 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου λαβὲ τὰ κρέα καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους τοὺς ἀζύμους καὶ θὲς πρὸς τὴν πέτραν ἐκείνην καὶ τὸν ζωμὸν ἔκχεον καὶ ἐποίησεν οὕτως
21 καὶ ἐξέτεινεν ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου τὸ ἄκρον τῆς ῥάβδου τῆς ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἥψατο τῶν κρεῶν καὶ τῶν ἀζύμων καὶ ἀνήφθη πῦρ ἐκ τῆς πέτρας καὶ κατέφαγεν τὰ κρέα καὶ τοὺς ἀζύμους καὶ ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου ἀπῆλθεν ἐξ ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ
22 καὶ εἶδεν Γεδεων ὅτι ἄγγελος κυρίου ἐστίν καὶ εἶπεν Γεδεων ἆ ἆ κύριε κύριε ὅτι εἶδον τὸν ἄγγελον κυρίου πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον
23 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ κύριος εἰρήνη σοι μὴ φοβοῦ μὴ ἀποθάνῃς

25 καὶ ἐγενήθη τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ κύριος λαβὲ τὸν μόσχον τὸν σιτευτὸν τοῦ πατρός σου μόσχον τὸν ἑπταετῆ καὶ καθελεῖς τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ Βααλ ὅ ἐστιν τοῦ πατρός σου καὶ τὸ ἄλσος τὸ ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ ἐκκόψεις

27 καὶ ἔλαβεν Γεδεων τρεῖς καὶ δέκα ἄνδρας ἀπὸ τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐποίησεν καθὰ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς αὐτὸν κύριος καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐφοβήθη τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς πόλεως μὴ ποιῆσαι ἡμέρας καὶ ἐποίησεν νυκτός
28 καὶ ὤρθρισαν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως τὸ πρωί καὶ ἰδοὺ κατεσκαμμένον τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ Βααλ καὶ τὸ ἄλσος τὸ ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ ἐκκεκομμένον καὶ ὁ μόσχος ὁ σιτευτὸς ἀνηνεγμένος εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ ᾠκοδομημένον
29 καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ τίς ἐποίησεν τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο καὶ ἀνήταζον καὶ ἐξεζήτουν καὶ εἶπαν Γεδεων ὁ υἱὸς Ιωας ἐποίησεν τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο
30 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως πρὸς Ιωας ἐξάγαγε τὸν υἱόν σου καὶ ἀποθανέτω ὅτι κατέσκαψεν τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ Βααλ καὶ ὅτι ἔκοψεν τὸ ἄλσος τὸ ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ
31 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωας πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς ἑσταμένους ἐ{P'} αὐτόν μὴ ὑμεῖς νῦν δικάζεσθε περὶ τοῦ Βααλ ἢ ὑμεῖς σῴζετε αὐτόν ὃς ἀντεδίκησεν αὐτόν ἀποθανεῖται ἕως πρωί εἰ ἔστιν θεός αὐτὸς ἐκδικήσει αὐτόν ὅτι κατέσκαψεν τὸ θυσιαστήριον αὐτοῦ
32 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ Δικαστήριον τοῦ Βααλ ὅτι κατέσκαψεν τὸ θυσιαστήριον αὐτοῦ

33 καὶ πᾶσα Μαδιαμ καὶ Αμαληκ καὶ υἱοὶ ἀνατολῶν συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ καὶ διέβησαν καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι Ιεζραελ
34 καὶ πνεῦμα θεοῦ ἐνέδυσεν τὸν Γεδεων καὶ ἐσάλπισεν ἐν κερατίνῃ καὶ ἐβόησεν Αβιεζερ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ
35 καὶ ἀγγέλους ἐξαπέστειλεν ἐν παντὶ Μανασση καὶ ἐβόησεν καὶ αὐτὸς ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους ἐν Ασηρ καὶ ἐν Ζαβουλων καὶ ἐν Νεφθαλι καὶ ἀνέβησαν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῦ
36 καὶ εἶπεν Γεδεων πρὸς τὸν θεόν εἰ σῴζεις ἐν τῇ χειρί μου τὸν Ισραηλ ὃν τρόπον ἐλάλησας
37 ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀπερείδομαι τὸν πόκον τῶν ἐρίων ἐν τῷ ἅλωνι καὶ ἐὰν δρόσος γένηται ἐπὶ τὸν πόκον μόνον καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ξηρασία καὶ γνώσομαι ὅτι σῴζεις ἐν τῇ χειρί μου τὸν Ισραηλ ὃν τρόπον ἐλάλησας
38 καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως καὶ ὤρθρισεν Γεδεων τῇ ἐπαύριον καὶ ἀπεπίασεν τὸν πόκον καὶ ἀπερρύη ἡ δρόσος ἐκ τοῦ πόκου πλήρης λεκάνη ὕδατος
39 καὶ εἶπεν Γεδεων πρὸς τὸν θεόν μὴ ὀργισθήτω ὁ θυμός σου ἐν ἐμοί καὶ λαλήσω ἔτι ἅπαξ καὶ πειράσω ἔτι ἅπαξ ἐν τῷ πόκῳ καὶ γενηθήτω ξηρασία ἐπὶ τὸν πόκον μόνον ἐπὶ δὲ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν γενηθήτω δρόσος
40 καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς οὕτως ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ καὶ ἐγένετο ξηρασία ἐπὶ τὸν πόκον μόνον ἐπὶ δὲ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἐγένετο δρόσος
