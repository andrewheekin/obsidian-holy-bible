# Book of Judges 14 (RSVCE)

### Samson’s Marriage
1 Samson went down to Timnah, and at Timnah he saw one of the daughters of the Philistines.
2 Then he came up, and told his father and mother, “I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah; now get her for me as my wife.”
3 But his father and mother said to him, “Is there not a woman among the daughters of your kinsmen, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me; for she pleases me well.”
4 His father and mother did not know that it was from theLord; for he was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
5 Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, and he came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion roared against him;
6 and the Spirit of theLordcame mightily upon him, and he tore the lion asunder as one tears a kid; and he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
7 Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
8 And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
9 He scraped it out into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the carcass of the lion.
10 And his father went down to the woman, and Samson made a feast there; for so the young men used to do.
11 And when the people saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.
12 And Samson said to them, “Let me now put a riddle to you; if you can tell me what it is, within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments;
13 but if you cannot tell me what it is, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments.” And they said to him, “Put your riddle, that we may hear it.”
14 And he said to them, “Out of the eater came something to eat. Out of the strong came something sweet.” And they could not in three days tell what the riddle was.
15 On the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle is, lest we burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us here to impoverish us?”
16 And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, “You only hate me, you do not love me; you have put a riddle to my countrymen, and you have not told me what it is.” And he said to her, “Behold, I have not told my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?”
17 She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted; and on the seventh day he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told the riddle to her countrymen.
18 And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?” And he said to them, “If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle.”
19 And the Spirit of theLordcame mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashʹkelon and killed thirty men of the town, and took their spoil and gave the festal garments to those who had told the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father’s house.
20 And Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.


# Liber Judicum 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Descendit ergo Samson in Thamnatha: vidensque ibi mulierem de filiabus Philisthiim,
2 ascendit, et nuntiavit patri suo et matri suæ, dicens: Vidi mulierem in Thamnatha de filiabus Philisthinorum: quam quæso ut mihi accipiatis uxorem.
3 Cui dixerunt pater et mater sua: Numquid non est mulier in filiabus fratrum tuorum, et in omni populo meo, quia vis accipere uxorem de Philisthiim, qui incircumcisi sunt? Dixitque Samson ad patrem suum: Hanc mihi accipe: quia placuit oculis meis.
4 Parentes autem ejus nesciebant quod res a Domino fieret, et quæreret occasionem contra Philisthiim: eo enim tempore Philisthiim dominabantur Israëli.
5 Descendit itaque Samson cum patre suo et matre in Thamnatha. Cumque venissent ad vineas oppidi, apparuit catulus leonis sævus, et rugiens, et occurrit ei.
6 Irruit autem spiritus Domini in Samson, et dilaceravit leonem, quasi hædum in frustra discerpens, nihil omnino habens in manu: et hoc patri et matri noluit indicare.
7 Descenditque, et locutus est mulieri quæ placuerat oculis ejus.

8 Et post aliquot dies revertens ut acciperet eam, declinavit ut videret cadaver leonis, et ecce examen apum in ore leonis erat ac favus mellis.
9 Quem cum sumpsisset in manibus comedebat in via: veniensque ad patrem suum et matrem, dedit eis partem, qui et ipsi comederunt: nec tamen eis voluit indicare quod mel de corpore leonis assumpserat.
10 Descendit itaque pater ejus ad mulierem, et fecit filio suo Samson convivium: sic enim juvenes facere consueverant.
11 Cum ergo cives loci illius vidissent eum, dederunt ei sodales triginta ut essent cum eo.
12 Quibus locutus est Samson: Proponam vobis problema: quod si solveritis mihi intra septem dies convivii, dabo vobis triginta sindones, et totidem tunicas:
13 sin autem non potueritis solvere, vos dabitis mihi triginta sindones, et ejusdem numeri tunicas. Qui responderunt ei: Propone problema, ut audiamus.
14 Dixitque eis:De comedente exivit cibus,et de forti egressa est dulcedo.Nec potuerunt per tres dies propositionem solvere.
15 Cumque adesset dies septimus, dixerunt ad uxorem Samson: Blandire viro tuo et suade ei ut indicet tibi quid significet problema: quod si facere nolueris, incendemus te, et domum patris tui: an idcirco vocastis nos ad nuptias ut spoliaretis?
16 Quæ fundebat apud Samson lacrimas, et quærebatur, dicens: Odisti me, et non diligis: idcirco problema, quod proposuisti filiis populi mei, non vis mihi exponere. At ille respondit: Patri meo et matri nolui dicere: et tibi indicare potero?
17 Septem igitur diebus convivii flebat ante eum: tandemque die septimo cum ei esset molesta, exposuit. Quæ statim indicavit civibus suis.
18 Et illi dixerunt ei die septimo ante solis occubitum:Quid dulcius melle,et quid fortius leone?Qui ait ad eos:Si non arassetis in vitula mea,non invenissetis propositionem meam.
19 Irruit itaque in eum spiritus Domini, descenditque Ascalonem, et percussit ibi triginta viros: quorum ablatas vestes dedit iis qui problema solverant. Iratusque nimis ascendit in domum patris sui:
20 uxor autem ejus accepit maritum unum de amicis ejus et pronubis.

1 καὶ κατέβη Σαμψων εἰς Θαμναθα καὶ εἶδεν γυναῖκα ἐν Θαμναθα ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ ἀνέβη καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν γυναῖκα ἑώρακα ἐν Θαμναθα ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ νῦν λάβετέ μοι αὐτὴν εἰς γυναῖκα
3 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ μὴ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου καὶ ἐν παντὶ τῷ λαῷ μου γυνή ὅτι σὺ πορεύῃ λαβεῖν γυναῖκα ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τῶν ἀπεριτμήτων καὶ εἶπεν Σαμψων πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ ταύτην λαβέ μοι ὅτι ἤρεσεν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου
4 καὶ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ὅτι παρὰ κυρίου ἐστίν ὅτι ἀνταπόδομα αὐτὸς ἐκζητεῖ ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐκυρίευον τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ
5 καὶ κατέβη Σαμψων καὶ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ εἰς Θαμναθα καὶ ἐξέκλινεν εἰς ἀμπελῶνα Θαμναθα καὶ ἰδοὺ σκύμνος λεόντων ὠρυόμενος εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ κατηύθυνεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν πνεύμα κυρίου καὶ διέσπασεν αὐτόν ὡσεὶ διασπάσαι ἔριφον αἰγῶν καὶ οὐδὲν ἦν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ τῇ μητρὶ ἃ ἐποίησεν
7 καὶ κατέβησαν καὶ ἐλάλησαν τῇ γυναικί καὶ ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιον Σαμψων

8 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν με{Q'} ἡμέρας λαβεῖν αὐτὴν καὶ ἐξέκλινεν ἰδεῖν τὸ πτῶμα τοῦ λέοντος καὶ ἰδοὺ συστροφὴ μελισσῶν ἐν τῷ στόματι τοῦ λέοντος καὶ μέλι ἦν
9 καὶ ἐξεῖλεν αὐτὸ εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπορεύθη πορευόμενος καὶ ἔσθων καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ πρὸς τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς ὅτι ἐκ τῆς ἕξεως τοῦ λέοντος ἐξεῖλεν τὸ μέλι
10 καὶ κατέβη ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐκεῖ Σαμψων πότον ἡμέρας ἑπτά ὅτι οὕτως ἐποίουν οἱ νεανίσκοι
11 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ φοβεῖσθαι αὐτοὺς αὐτὸν προσκατέστησαν αὐτῷ ἑταίρους τριάκοντα καὶ ἦσαν με{T'} αὐτοῦ
12 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαμψων προβαλῶ ὑμῖν πρόβλημα καὶ ἐὰν ἀπαγγείλητέ μοι τὸ πρόβλημα ἐν ταῖς ἑπτὰ ἡμέραις τοῦ πότου δώσω ὑμῖν τριάκοντα σινδόνας καὶ τριάκοντα στολάς
13 καὶ ἐὰν μὴ δυνασθῆτε ἀπαγγεῖλαί μοι καὶ δώσετε ὑμεῖς ἐμοὶ τριάκοντα σινδόνας καὶ τριάκοντα στολὰς ἱματίων καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ προβαλοῦ τὸ πρόβλημά σου καὶ ἀκουσόμεθα αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἐκ τοῦ ἔσθοντος ἐξῆλθεν βρῶσις καὶ ἐξ ἰσχυροῦ ἐξῆλθεν γλυκύ καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνάσθησαν ἀπαγγεῖλαι τὸ πρόβλημα ἐπὶ τρεῖς ἡμέρας
15 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τετάρτῃ καὶ εἶπαν τῇ γυναικὶ Σαμψων ἀπάτησον δὴ τὸν ἄνδρα σου καὶ ἀπαγγειλάτω σοι τὸ πρόβλημα μήποτε ἐμπυρίσωμέν σε καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός σου ἐν πυρί ἦ πτωχεῦσαι ἐκαλέσατε ἡμᾶς
16 καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ἡ γυνὴ Σαμψων ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ μεμίσηκάς με καὶ οὐκ ἠγάπηκάς με ὅτι τὸ πρόβλημα ὃ προεβάλου τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ λαοῦ μου κἀμοὶ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλας αὐτό καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Σαμψων ἰδοὺ τῷ πατρί μου καὶ τῇ μητρί μου οὐκ ἀπήγγειλα αὐτό καὶ σοὶ ἀπαγγελῶ
17 καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὰς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἐν αἷς ἦν ἐν αὐταῖς ὁ πότος καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῇ ὅτι παρηνώχλησεν αὐτόν καὶ αὐτὴ ἀπήγγειλεν τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς
18 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ πρὶν δῦναι τὸν ἥλιον τί γλυκύτερον μέλιτος καὶ τί ἰσχυρότερον λέοντος καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαμψων εἰ μὴ κατεδαμάσατέ μου τὴν δάμαλιν οὐκ ἂν εὕρετε τὸ πρόβλημά μου
19 καὶ κατεύθυνεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν πνεῦμα κυρίου καὶ κατέβη εἰς Ἀσκαλῶνα καὶ ἔπαισεν ἐκεῖθεν τριάκοντα ἄνδρας καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰς στολὰς αὐτῶν καὶ ἔδωκεν τοῖς ἀπαγγείλασιν τὸ πρόβλημα καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ Σαμψων καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ
20 καὶ συνῴκησεν ἡ γυνὴ Σαμψων τῷ νυμφαγωγῷ αὐτοῦ ὃς ἦν ἑταῖρος αὐτοῦ
