# Book of Judges 8 (RSVCE)

### Gideon’s Triumph and Vengeance
1 And the men of Eʹphraim said to him, “What is this that you have done to us, not to call us when you went to fight with Midʹian?” And they upbraided him violently.
2 And he said to them, “What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Eʹphraim better than the vintage of Abi-eʹzer?
3 God has given into your hands the princes of Midʹian, Oreb and Zeeb; what have I been able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger against him was abated, when he had said this.
4 And Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, faint yet pursuing.
5 So he said to the men of Succoth, “Pray, give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunʹna, the kings of Midʹian.”
6 And the officials of Succoth said, “Are Zebah and Zalmunʹna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?”
7 And Gideon said, “Well then, when theLordhas given Zebah and Zalmunʹna into my hand, I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.”
8 And from there he went up to Penuʹel, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penuʹel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
9 And he said to the men of Penuʹel, “When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.”
10 Now Zebah and Zalmunʹna were in Karkor with their army, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East; for there had fallen a hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword.
11 And Gideon went up by the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogʹbehah, and attacked the army; for the army was off its guard.
12 And Zebah and Zalmunʹna fled; and he pursued them and took the two kings of Midʹian, Zebah and Zalmunʹna, and he threw all the army into a panic.
13 Then Gideon the son of Joʹash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.
14 And he caught a young man of Succoth, and questioned him; and he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men.
15 And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunʹna, about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are Zebah and Zalmunʹna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are faint?’ ”
16 And he took the elders of the city and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth.
17 And he broke down the tower of Penuʹel, and slew the men of the city.
18 Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunʹna, “Where are the men whom you slew at Tabor?” They answered, “As you are, so were they, every one of them; they resembled the sons of a king.”
19 And he said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother; as theLordlives, if you had saved them alive, I would not slay you.”
20 And he said to Jether his first-born, “Rise, and slay them.” But the youth did not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.
21 Then Zebah and Zalmunʹna said, “Rise yourself, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” And Gideon arose and slew Zebah and Zalmunʹna; and he took the crescents that were on the necks of their camels.
### Gideon’s Idolatry
22 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also; for you have delivered us out of the hand of Midʹian.”
23 Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; theLordwill rule over you.”
24 And Gideon said to them, “Let me make a request of you; give me every man of you the earrings of his spoil.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishʹmaelites.)
25 And they answered, “We will willingly give them.” And they spread a garment, and every man cast in it the earrings of his spoil.
26 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold; besides the crescents and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midʹian, and besides the collars that were about the necks of their camels.
27 And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah; and all Israel played the harlot after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family.
28 So Midʹian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
### Death of Gideon
29 Jerubbaʹal the son of Joʹash went and dwelt in his own house.
30 Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives.
31 And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimʹelech.
32 And Gideon the son of Joʹash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joʹash his father, at Ophrah of the Abiezʹrites.
33 As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel turned again and played the harlot after the Baʹals, and made Baʹal-beʹrith their god.
34 And the people of Israel did not remember theLordtheir God, who had rescued them from the hand of all their enemies on every side;
35 and they did not show kindness to the family of Jerubbaʹal (that is, Gideon) in return for all the good that he had done to Israel.


# Liber Judicum 8 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dixeruntque ad eum viri Ephraim: Quid est hoc quod facere voluisti, ut nos non vocares, cum ad pugnam pergeres contra Madian? jurgantes fortiter, et prope vim inferentes.
2 Quibus ille respondit: Quod enim tale facere potui, quale vos fecistis? nonne melior est racemus Ephraim, vindemiis Abiezer?
3 In manus vestras Dominus tradidit principes Madian, Oreb et Zeb: quid tale facere potui, quale vos fecistis? Quod cum locutus esset, requievit spiritus eorum, quo tumebant contra eum.

4 Cumque venisset Gedeon ad Jordanem, transivit eum cum trecentis viris, qui secum erant: et præ lassitudine, fugientes persequi non poterant.
5 Dixitque ad viros Soccoth: Date, obsecro, panes populo qui mecum est, quia valde defecerunt: ut possimus persequi Zebee et Salmana reges Madian.
6 Responderunt principes Soccoth: Forsitan palmæ manuum Zebee et Salmana in manu tua sunt, et idcirco postulas ut demus exercitui tuo panes.
7 Quibus ille ait: Cum ergo tradiderit Dominus Zebee et Salmana in manus meas, conteram carnes vestras cum spinis tribulisque deserti.
8 Et inde conscendens, venit in Phanuel: locutusque est ad viros loci illius similia. Cui et illi responderunt, sicut responderant viri Soccoth.
9 Dixit itaque et eis: Cum reversus fuero victor in pace, destruam turrim hanc.

10 Zebee autem et Salmana requiescebant cum omni exercitu suo. Quindecim enim millia viri remanserant ex omnibus turmis orientalium populorum, cæsis centum viginti millibus bellatorum educentium gladium.
11 Ascendensque Gedeon per viam eorum, qui in tabernaculis morabantur, ad orientalem partem Nobe et Jegbaa, percussit castra hostium, qui securi erant, et nihil adversi suspicabantur.
12 Fugeruntque Zebee et Salmana, quos persequens Gedeon comprehendit, turbato omni exercitu eorum.
13 Revertensque de bello ante solis ortum,
14 apprehendit puerum de viris Soccoth: interrogavitque eum nomina principum et seniorum Soccoth, et descripsit septuaginta septem viros.
15 Venitque ad Soccoth, et dixit eis: En Zebee et Salmana, super quibus exprobrastis mihi, dicentes: Forsitan manus Zebee et Salmana in manibus tuis sunt, et idcirco postulas ut demus viris, qui lassi sunt et defecerunt, panes.
16 Tulit ergo seniores civitatis et spinas deserti ac tribulos, et contrivit cum eis atque comminuit viros Soccoth.
17 Turrim quoque Phanuel subvertit, occisis habitatoribus civitatis.

18 Dixitque ad Zebee et Salmana: Quales fuerunt viri, quos occidistis in Thabor? Qui responderunt: Similes tui, et unus ex eis quasi filius regis.
19 Quibus ille respondit: Fratres mei fuerunt, filii matris meæ. Vivit Dominus, quia si servassetis eos, non vos occiderem.
20 Dixitque Jether primogenito suo: Surge, et interfice eos. Qui non eduxit gladium: timebat enim, quia adhuc puer erat.
21 Dixeruntque Zebee et Salmana: Tu surge, et irrue in nos: quia juxta ætatem robur est hominis. Surrexit Gedeon, et interfecit Zebee et Salmana: et tulit ornamenta ac bullas quibus colla regalium camelorum decorari solent.

22 Dixeruntque omnes viri Israël ad Gedeon: Dominare nostri tu, et filius tuus, et filius filii tui: quia liberasti nos de manu Madian.
23 Quibus ille ait: Non dominabor vestri, nec dominabitur in vos filius meus, sed dominabitur vobis Dominus.
24 Dixitque ad eos: Unam petitionem postulo a vobis: date mihi inaures ex præda vestra. Inaures enim aureas Ismaëlitæ habere consueverant.
25 Qui responderunt: Libentissime dabimus. Expandentesque super terram pallium, projecerunt in eo inaures de præda:
26 et fuit pondus postulatarum inaurium, mille septingenti auri sicli, absque ornamentis, et monilibus, et veste purpurea, quibus reges Madian uti soliti erant, et præter torques aureas camelorum.
27 Fecitque ex eo Gedeon ephod, et posuit illud in civitate sua Ephra. Fornicatusque est omnis Israël in eo, et factum est Gedeoni et omni domui ejus in ruinam.
28 Humiliatus est autem Madian coram filiis Israël, nec potuerunt ultra cervices elevare: sed quievit terra per quadraginta annos, quibus Gedeon præfuit.

29 Abiit itaque Jerobaal filius Joas, et habitavit in domo sua:
30 habuitque septuaginta filios, qui egressi sunt de femore ejus: eo quod plures haberet uxores.
31 Concubina autem illius, quam habebat in Sichem, genuit ei filium nomine Abimelech.
32 Mortuusque est Gedeon filius Joas in senectute bona, et sepultus est in sepulchro Joas patris sui in Ephra de familia Ezri.
33 Postquam autem mortuus est Gedeon, aversi sunt filii Israël, et fornicati sunt cum Baalim. Percusseruntque cum Baal fœdus, ut esset eis in deum:
34 nec recordati sunt Domini Dei sui, qui eruit eos de manibus inimicorum suorum omnium per circuitum:
35 nec fecerunt misericordiam cum domo Jerobaal Gedeon, juxta omnia bona quæ fecerat Israëli.

1 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀνὴρ Εφραιμ τί τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ἐποίησας ἡμῖν τοῦ μὴ καλέσαι ἡμᾶς ὅτε ἐξεπορεύου πολεμῆσαι ἐν τῇ Μαδιαμ καὶ ἐκρίνοντο με{T'} αὐτοῦ κραταιῶς
2 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς τί ἐποίησα νῦν καθὼς ὑμεῖς οὐχὶ κρείττω ἐπιφυλλίδες Εφραιμ ἢ τρυγητὸς Αβιεζερ
3 ἐν χειρὶ ὑμῶν παρέδωκεν κύριος τοὺς ἄρχοντας Μαδιαμ τὸν Ωρηβ καὶ τὸν Ζηβ καὶ τί ἠδυνάσθην ποιῆσαι καθὼς ὑμεῖς καὶ κατέπαυσαν τότε ἀνῆκε τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτῶν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ λαλῆσαι αὐτὸν τὸν λόγον τοῦτον

4 καὶ ἦλθεν Γεδεων ἐπὶ τὸν Ιορδάνην καὶ διέβη αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ τριακόσιοι ἄνδρες με{T'} αὐτοῦ ὀλιγοψυχοῦντες καὶ πεινῶντες
5 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν Σοκχωθ δότε δὴ ἄρτους τῷ λαῷ τῷ με{T'} ἐμοῦ ὅτι πεινῶσιν ἐγὼ δὲ διώκω ὀπίσω Ζεβεε καὶ Σαλμανα βασιλέων Μαδιαμ
6 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄρχοντες Σοκχωθ μὴ χεὶρ Ζεβεε καὶ Σαλμανα νῦν ἐν τῇ χειρί σου ὅτι δώσομεν τῇ στρατιᾷ σου ἄρτους
7 καὶ εἶπεν Γεδεων οὐχ οὕτως ἐν τῷ δοῦναι κύριον τὸν Ζεβεε καὶ Σαλμανα ἐν τῇ χειρί μου καὶ καταξανῶ τὰς σάρκας ὑμῶν ἐν ταῖς ἀκάνθαις τῆς ἐρήμου καὶ ἐν ταῖς βαρκοννιμ
8 καὶ ἀνέβη ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Φανουηλ καὶ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς κατὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες Φανουηλ ὃν τρόπον ἀπεκρίθησαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες Σοκχωθ
9 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν Φανουηλ λέγων ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέφειν με με{T'} εἰρήνης κατασκάψω τὸν πύργον τοῦτον

10 καὶ Ζεβεε καὶ Σαλμανα ἐν Καρκαρ καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτῶν με{T'} αὐτῶν ὡσεὶ πεντεκαίδεκα χιλιάδες οἱ καταλειφθέντες ἐν πάσῃ παρεμβολῇ υἱῶν ἀνατολῶν καὶ οἱ πεπτωκότες ἦσαν ἑκατὸν καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν ἐσπασμένων ῥομφαίαν
11 καὶ ἀνέβη Γεδεων ὁδὸν κατοικούντων ἐν σκηναῖς ἀνατολῶν τῆς Ναβεθ ἐξ ἐναντίας Ζεβεε καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὴν παρεμβολήν ἡ δὲ παρεμβολὴ ἦν πεποιθυῖα
12 καὶ ἔφυγεν Ζεβεε καὶ Σαλμανα καὶ ἐδίωξεν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν καὶ ἐκράτησεν τοὺς δύο βασιλεῖς Μαδιαμ τὸν Ζεβεε καὶ τὸν Σαλμανα καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν παρεμβολὴν αὐτῶν ἐξέτριψεν
13 καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν Γεδεων υἱὸς Ιωας ἐκ τοῦ πολέμου ἀπὸ ἀναβάσεως Αρες
14 καὶ συνέλαβον παιδάριον ἐκ τῶν ἀνδρῶν Σοκχωθ καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτόν καὶ ἀπεγράψατο πρὸς αὐτοὺς τοὺς ἄρχοντας Σοκχωθ καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους αὐτῆς ἑβδομήκοντα ἑπτὰ ἄνδρας
15 καὶ παρεγένετο Γεδεων πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας Σοκχωθ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἰδοὺ Ζεβεε καὶ Σαλμανα δ{I'} οὓς ὠνειδίσατέ με λέγοντες μὴ χεὶρ Ζεβεε καὶ Σαλμανα νῦν ἐν τῇ χειρί σου ὅτι δώσομεν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν σου τοῖς ἐκλελυμένοις ἄρτους
16 καὶ ἔλαβεν τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς πόλεως καὶ κατέξανεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ταῖς ἀκάνθαις τῆς ἐρήμου καὶ ταῖς βαρακηνιμ καὶ κατέξανεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἄνδρας Σοκχωθ
17 καὶ τὸν πύργον Φανουηλ κατέσκαψεν καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς πόλεως

18 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Ζεβεε καὶ Σαλμανα ποῦ οἱ ἄνδρες οὓς ἀπεκτείνατε ἐν Θαβωρ καὶ εἶπαν ὡσεὶ σύ ὅμοιος σοί ὅμοιος αὐτῶν ὡς εἶδος μορφὴ υἱῶν βασιλέων
19 καὶ εἶπεν Γεδεων ἀδελφοί μου καὶ υἱοὶ τῆς μητρός μού εἰσιν καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς ζῇ κύριος εἰ ἐζωογονήσατε αὐτούς οὐκ ἂν ἀπέκτεινα ὑμᾶς
20 καὶ εἶπεν τῷ Ιεθερ τῷ πρωτοτόκῳ αὐτοῦ ἀναστὰς ἀπόκτεινον αὐτούς καὶ οὐκ ἔσπασεν τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ τὴν μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐφοβήθη ὅτι ἦν νεώτερος
21 καὶ εἶπεν Ζεβεε καὶ Σαλμανα ἀνάστα δὴ σὺ καὶ ἀπάντησον ἡμῖν ὅτι ὡς ἀνὴρ ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέστη Γεδεων καὶ ἀνεῖλεν τὸν Ζεβεε καὶ τὸν Σαλμανα καὶ ἔλαβεν τοὺς μηνίσκους τοὺς ἐν τοῖς τραχήλοις τῶν καμήλων αὐτῶν

22 καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ πρὸς Γεδεων ἄρχε ἐν ἡμῖν σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου ὅτι σέσωκας ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς Μαδιαμ
23 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Γεδεων οὐκ ἄρξω ἐγὼ ὑμῶν καὶ οὐκ ἄρξει ὁ υἱός μου ὑμῶν κύριος ἄρξει ὑμῶν
24 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Γεδεων αἰτήσομαι πα{R'} ὑμῶν αἴτησιν καὶ δότε μοι ἀνὴρ ἐνώτιον τῶν σκύλων αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐνώτια χρυσᾶ πολλὰ ἦν αὐτοῖς ὅτι Ισμαηλῖται ἦσαν
25 καὶ εἶπαν διδόντες δώσομεν καὶ ἀνέπτυξεν τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔρριψεν ἐκεῖ ἀνὴρ ἐνώτιον χρυσοῦν τῶν σκύλων αὐτοῦ
26 καὶ ἐγενήθη ὁ σταθμὸς τῶν ἐνωτίων τῶν χρυσῶν ὧν ᾐτήσατο σίκλοι χίλιοι καὶ ἑπτακόσιοι χρυσοῦ πλὴν τῶν σιρώνων καὶ τῶν ὁρμίσκων ενφωθ καὶ τῶν περιβολαίων τῶν πορφυρῶν τῶν ἐπὶ τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Μαδιαμ καὶ πλὴν τῶν κλοιῶν τῶν χρυσῶν τῶν ἐν τοῖς τραχήλοις τῶν καμήλων αὐτῶν
27 καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὸ Γεδεων εἰς εφουδ καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὸ ἐν πόλει αὐτοῦ ἐν Εφραθα καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσεν πᾶς Ισραηλ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐγένετο τῷ Γεδεων καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ εἰς σκάνδαλον
28 καὶ ἐνετράπη Μαδιαμ ἐνώπιον υἱῶν Ισραηλ καὶ οὐ προσέθεντο ἆραι κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ ἔτη τεσσαράκοντα ἐν ἡμέραις Γεδεων

29 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ιεροβααλ υἱὸς Ιωας καὶ κατῴκησεν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ
30 καὶ τῷ Γεδεων ἦσαν ἑβδομήκοντα υἱοὶ ἐκπορευόμενοι ἐκ μηρῶν αὐτοῦ ὅτι γυναῖκες πολλαὶ ἦσαν αὐτῷ
31 καὶ ἡ παλλακὴ αὐτοῦ ἡ ἐν Σικιμοις ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ καί γε αὐτὴ υἱόν καὶ ἐπέθηκεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Αβιμελεχ
32 καὶ ἀπέθανεν Γεδεων υἱὸς Ιωας ἐν πολιᾷ ἀγαθῇ καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν τῷ τάφῳ Ιωας τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν Εφραθα πατρὸς Αβιεζρι
33 καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς ἀπέθανεν Γεδεων καὶ ἀπεστράφησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσαν ὀπίσω τῶν Βααλιμ καὶ ἔθεντο αὑτοῖς τὸν Βααλβεριθ εἰς διαθήκην τοῦ εἶναι αὐτοῖς αὐτὸν εἰς θεόν
34 καὶ οὐκ ἐμνήσθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτῶν τοῦ ῥυσαμένου αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν κυκλόθεν
35 καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησαν ἔλεος μετὰ τοῦ οἴκου Ιεροβααλ Γεδεων κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀγαθωσύνην ἣν ἐποίησεν μετὰ Ισραηλ
