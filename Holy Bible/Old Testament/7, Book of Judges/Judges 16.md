# Book of Judges 16 (RSVCE)

### Samson and Delilah
1 Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a harlot, and he went in to her.
2 The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here,” and they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. They kept quiet all night, saying, “Let us wait till the light of the morning; then we will kill him.”
3 But Samson lay till midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts, and pulled them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that is before Hebron.
4 After this he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Deliʹlah.
5 And the lords of the Philistines came to her and said to her, “Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to subdue him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”
6 And Deliʹlah said to Samson, “Please tell me wherein your great strength lies, and how you might be bound, that one could subdue you.”
7 And Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings which have not been dried, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”
8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
9 Now she had men lying in wait in an inner chamber. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he snapped the bowstrings, as a string of tow snaps when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.
10 And Deliʹlah said to Samson, “Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies; please tell me how you might be bound.”
11 And he said to her, “If they bind me with new ropes that have not been used, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”
12 So Deliʹlah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And the men lying in wait were in an inner chamber. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.
13 And Deliʹlah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me, and told me lies; tell me how you might be bound.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and make it tight with the pin, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”
14 So while he slept, Deliʹlah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web. And she made them tight with the pin, and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he awoke from his sleep, and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web.
15 And she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and you have not told me wherein your great strength lies.”
16 And when she pressed him hard with her words day after day, and urged him, his soul was vexed to death.
17 And he told her all his mind, and said to her, “A razor has never come upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I be shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”
18 When Deliʹlah saw that he had told her all his mind, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up this once, for he has told me all his mind.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hands.
19 She made him sleep upon her knees; and she called a man, and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him.
20 And she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he awoke from his sleep, and said, “I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free.” And he did not know that theLordhad left him.
21 And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with bronze fetters; and he ground at the mill in the prison.
22 But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
### Samson’s Death
23 Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, “Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand.”
24 And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, “Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the ravager of our country, who has slain many of us.”
25 And when their hearts were merry, they said, “Call Samson, that he may make sport for us.” So they called Samson out of the prison, and he made sport before them. They made him stand between the pillars;
26 and Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them.”
27 Now the house was full of men and women; all the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about three thousand men and women, who looked on while Samson made sport.
28 Then Samson called to theLordand said, “O LordGod, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be avenged upon the Philistines for one of my two eyes.”
29 And Samson grasped the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and he leaned his weight upon them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other.
30 And Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” Then he bowed with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were in it. So the dead whom he slew at his death were more than those whom he had slain during his life.
31 Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshʹta-ol in the tomb of Manoʹah his father. He had judged Israel twenty years.


# Liber Judicum 16 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Abiit quoque in Gazam, et vidit ibi mulierem meretricem, ingressusque est ad eam.
2 Quod cum audissent Philisthiim, et percrebruisset apud eos intrasse urbem Samson, circumdederunt eum, positis in porta civitatis custodibus: et ibi tota nocte cum silentio præstolantes, ut facto mane exeuntem occiderent.
3 Dormivit autem Samson usque ad medium noctem: et inde consurgens, apprehendit ambas portæ fores cum postibus suis et sera, impositasque humeris suis portavit ad verticem montis, qui respicit Hebron.

4 Post hæc amavit mulierem, quæ habitabat in valle Sorec, et vocabatur Dalila.
5 Veneruntque ad eam principes Philisthinorum, atque dixerunt: Decipe eum, et disce ab illo, in quo habeat tantam fortitudinem, et quomodo eum superare valeamus, et vinctum affligere: quod si feceris, dabimus tibi singuli mille et centum argenteos.
6 Locuta est ergo Dalila ad Samson: Dic mihi, obsecro, in quo sit tua maxima fortitudo, et quid sit quo ligatus erumpere nequeas?
7 Cui respondit Samson: Si septem nerviceis funibus necdum siccis, et adhuc humentibus, ligatus fuero, infirmus ero ut ceteri homines.
8 Attuleruntque ad eam satrapæ Philisthinorum septem funes, ut dixerat: quibus vinxit eam,
9 latentibus apud se insidiis, et in cubiculo finem rei expectantibus: clamavitque ad eum: Philisthiim super te, Samson. Qui rupit vincula, quomodo si rumpat quis filum de stuppæ tortum putamine, cum odorem ignis acceperit: et non est cognitum in quo esset fortitudo ejus.

10 Dixitque ad eum Dalila: Ecce illusisti mihi, et falsum locutus es: saltem nunc indica mihi quo ligari debeas.
11 Cui ille respondit: Si ligatus fuero novis funibus, qui numquam fuerunt in opere, infirmus ero, et aliorum hominum similis.
12 Quibus rursum Dalila vinxit eum, et clamavit: Philisthiim super te, Samson: in cubiculo insidiis præparatis. Qui ita rupit vincula quasi fila telarum.
13 Dixitque Dalila rursum ad eum: Usquequo decipis me, et falsum loqueris? ostende quo vinciri debeas. Cui respondit Samson: Si septem crines capitis mei cum licio plexueris, et clavum his circumligatum terræ fixeris, infirmus ero.
14 Quod cum fecisset Dalila, dixit ad eum: Philisthiim super te, Samson. Qui consurgens de somno extraxit clavum cum crinibus et licio.

15 Dixitque ad eum Dalila: Quomodo dicis quod amas me, cum animus tuus non sit mecum? Per tres vices mentitus es mihi, et noluisti dicere in quo sit maxima fortitudo tua.
16 Cumque molesta esset ei, et per multos dies jugiter adhæreret, spatium ad quietem non tribuens, defecit anima ejus, et ad mortem usque lassata est.
17 Tunc aperiens veritatem rei, dixit ad eam: Ferrum numquam ascendit super caput meum, quia nazaræus, id est, consecratus Deo, sum de utero matris meæ: si rasum fuerit caput meum, recedet a me fortitudo mea, et deficiam, eroque sicut ceteri homines.
18 Vidensque illa quod confessus ei esset omnem animum suum, misit ad principes Philisthinorum ac mandavit: Ascende adhuc semel, quia nunc mihi aperuit cor suum. Qui ascenderunt assumpta pecunia, quam promiserant.
19 At illa dormire eum fecit super genua sua, et in sinu suo reclinare caput. Vocavitque tonsorem, et rasit septem crines ejus, et cœpit abigere eum, et a se repellere: statim enim ab eo fortitudo discessit.
20 Dixitque: Philisthiim super te, Samson. Qui de somno consurgens, dixit in animo suo: Egrediar sicut ante feci, et me excutiam: nesciens quod recessisset ab eo Dominus.
21 Quem cum apprehendissent Philisthiim, statim eruerunt oculos ejus, et duxerunt Gazam vinctum catenis, et clausum in carcere molere fecerunt.

22 Jamque capilli ejus renasci cœperunt.
23 Et principes Philisthinorum convenerunt in unum ut immolarent hostias magnificas Dagon deo suo, et epularentur, dicentes: Tradidit deus noster inimicum nostrum Samson in manus nostras.
24 Quod etiam populus videns, laudabat deum suum, eademque dicebat: Tradidit deus noster adversarium nostrum in manus nostras, qui delevit terram nostram, et occidit plurimos.
25 Lætantesque per convivia, sumptis jam epulis, præceperunt ut vocaretur Samson, et ante eos luderet. Qui adductus de carcere ludebat ante eos, feceruntque eum stare inter duas columnas.
26 Qui dixit puero regenti gressus suos: Dimitte me, ut tangam columnas, quibus omnis imminet domus, et recliner super eas, et paululum requiescam.

27 Domus autem erat plena virorum ac mulierum, et erant ibi omnes principes Philisthinorum, ac de tecto et solario circiter tria millia utriusque sexus spectantes ludentem Samson.
28 At ille invocato Domino ait: Domine Deus, memento mei, et redde mihi nunc fortitudinem pristinam, Deus meus, ut ulciscar me de hostibus meis, et pro amissione duorum luminum unam ultionem recipiam.
29 Et apprehendens ambas columnas quibus innitebatur domus, alteramque earum dextera et alteram læva tenens,
30 ait: Moriatur anima mea cum Philisthiim. Concussisque fortiter columnis, cecidit domus super omnes principes, et ceteram multitudinem quæ ibi erat: multoque plures interfecit moriens, quam ante vivus occiderat.

31 Descendentes autem fratres ejus et universa cognatio, tulerunt corpus ejus, et sepelierunt inter Saraa et Esthaol in sepulchro patris sui Manue: judicavitque Israël viginti annis.

1 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Σαμψων ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Γάζαν καὶ εἶδεν ἐκεῖ γυναῖκα πόρνην καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτήν
2 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τοῖς Γαζαίοις λέγοντες ἥκει Σαμψων ἐνταῦθα καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν καὶ ἐνήδρευσαν αὐτὸν ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ἐπὶ τῆς πύλης τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐκώφευσαν ὅλην τὴν νύκτα λέγοντες ἕως φωτὸς πρωὶ μείνωμεν καὶ ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτόν
3 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Σαμψων ἕως τοῦ μεσονυκτίου καὶ ἀνέστη περὶ τὸ μεσονύκτιον καὶ ἐπελάβετο τῶν θυρῶν τῆς πύλης τῆς πόλεως καὶ τῶν δύο σταθμῶν καὶ ἀνεβάστασεν αὐτὰς σὺν τῷ μοχλῷ καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τῷ ὤμῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν αὐτὰ ἐπὶ τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ ὄρους ὅ ἐστιν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Χεβρων καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὰ ἐκεῖ

4 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἠγάπησεν γυναῖκα ἐπὶ τοῦ χειμάρρου Σωρηχ καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῇ Δαλιλα
5 καὶ ἀνέβησαν πρὸς αὐτὴν οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ ἀπάτησον αὐτὸν καὶ ἰδὲ ἐν τίνι ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ ἐστιν ἡ μεγάλη καὶ ἐν τίνι δυνησόμεθα πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ δήσομεν αὐτὸν ὥστε ταπεινῶσαι αὐτόν καὶ ἡμεῖς δώσομέν σοι ἀνὴρ χιλίους καὶ ἑκατὸν ἀργυρίου
6 καὶ εἶπεν Δαλιλα πρὸς Σαμψων ἀνάγγειλόν μοι ἐν τίνι ἡ ἰσχύς σου ἡ μεγάλη καὶ ἐν τίνι δεθήσῃ τοῦ ταπεινωθῆναί σε
7 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὴν Σαμψων ἐὰν δήσωσίν με ἐν ἑπτὰ νευραῖς ὑγραῖς μὴ ἠρημωμέναις καὶ ἀσθενήσω καὶ ἔσομαι ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀνθρώπων
8 καὶ ἀνήνεγκαν αὐτῇ οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἑπτὰ νευρὰς ὑγρὰς μὴ ἠρημωμένας καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐν αὐταῖς
9 καὶ τὸ ἔνεδρον αὐτοῦ ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ ταμιείῳ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπὶ σέ Σαμψων καὶ διέρρηξεν τὰς νευράς ὃν τρόπον διασπᾶται κλῶσμα τοῦ ἀποτινάγματος ἐν τῷ ὀσφρανθῆναι πυρός καὶ οὐκ ἐγνώσθη ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ

10 καὶ εἶπεν Δαλιλα πρὸς Σαμψων ἰδοὺ παρελογίσω με καὶ ἐλάλησας πρός με ψευδῆ νῦν οὖν ἀνάγγειλον δή μοι ἐν τίνι δεθήσῃ
11 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτήν ἐὰν δεσμῷ δήσωσίν με ἐν ἑπτὰ καλωδίοις καινοῖς ἐν οἷς οὐκ ἐγενήθη ἔργον καὶ ἀσθενήσω καὶ ἔσομαι ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀνθρώπων
12 καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτῷ Δαλιλα καλώδια καινὰ καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐν αὐτοῖς καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπὶ σέ Σαμψων καὶ τὸ ἔνεδρον ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ ταμιείῳ καὶ διέσπασεν αὐτὰ ἀπὸ τῶν βραχιόνων αὐτοῦ ὡς ῥάμμα
13 καὶ εἶπεν Δαλιλα πρὸς Σαμψων ἕως νῦν παρελογίσω με καὶ ἐλάλησας πρός με ψευδῆ ἀνάγγειλον δή μοι ἐν τίνι δεθήσῃ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτήν ἐὰν ὑφάνῃς τὰς ἑπτὰ σειρὰς τῆς κεφαλῆς μου μετὰ τοῦ διάσματος καὶ ἐγκρούσῃς ἐν τῷ πασσάλῳ εἰς τὸν τοῖχον καὶ ἔσομαι ἀσθενὴς ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀνθρώπων
14 καὶ ἐκοίμισεν αὐτὸν Δαλιλα καὶ ἐδιάσατο τοὺς ἑπτὰ βοστρύχους τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῆς ἐκτάσεως καὶ κατέκρουσεν ἐν τοῖς πασσάλοις εἰς τὸν τοῖχον καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπὶ σέ Σαμψων καὶ ἐξηγέρθη ἐκ τοῦ ὕπνου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξέσπασεν τοὺς πασσάλους σὺν τῷ ὑφάσματι ἐκ τοῦ τοίχου καὶ τὸ δίασμα καὶ οὐκ ἐγνώσθη ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ

15 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Δαλιλα πῶς ἐρεῖς ἠγάπηκά σε καὶ ἡ καρδία σου οὐκ ἔστιν με{T'} ἐμοῦ τοῦτο τρίτον παρελογίσω με καὶ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλάς μοι ἐν τίνι ἡ ἰσχύς σου ἡ μεγάλη
16 καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε κατειργάσατο αὐτὸν τοῖς λόγοις αὐτῆς ὅλην τὴν νύκτα καὶ παρηνώχλησεν αὐτόν καὶ ὠλιγοψύχησεν ἕως εἰς θάνατον
17 καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῇ πάντα τὰ ἀπὸ καρδίας αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ξυρὸν οὐκ ἀναβήσεται ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλήν μου ὅτι ναζιραῖος θεοῦ ἐγώ εἰμι ἐκ κοιλίας μητρός μου καὶ ἐὰν ξυρήσωμαι ἀποστήσεται ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ ἡ ἰσχύς μου καὶ ἀσθενήσω καὶ ἔσομαι κατὰ πάντας τοὺς ἀνθρώπους
18 καὶ εἶδεν Δαλιλα ὅτι ἀνήγγειλεν αὐτῇ πάντα τὰ ἀπὸ καρδίας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν πάντας τοὺς σατράπας τῶν ἀλλοφύλων λέγουσα ἀνάβητε τὸ ἅπαξ ὅτι ἀνήγγειλέν μοι πᾶσαν τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέβησαν πρὸς αὐτὴν πᾶσαι αἱ σατραπίαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἤνεγκαν τὸ ἀργύριον ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν
19 καὶ ἐκοίμισεν αὐτὸν ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν γονάτων αὐτῆς καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸν κουρέα καὶ ἐξύρησεν τοὺς ἑπτὰ βοστρύχους τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἤρξατο ταπεινοῦσθαι καὶ ἀπέστη ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
20 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δαλιλα οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπὶ σέ Σαμψων καὶ ἐξηγέρθη ἐκ τοῦ ὕπνου αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ἐξελεύσομαι καὶ ποιήσω καθὼς ἀεὶ καὶ ἀποτινάξομαι καὶ αὐτὸς οὐκ ἔγνω ὅτι κύριος ἀπέστη ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
21 καὶ ἐπελάβοντο αὐτοῦ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ ἐξώρυξαν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ κατήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς Γάζαν καὶ ἔδησαν αὐτὸν ἐν πέδαις χαλκαῖς καὶ ἦν ἀλήθων ἐν οἴκῳ τῆς φυλακῆς

22 καὶ ἤρξατο ἡ θρὶξ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι ἡνίκα ἐξυρήθη
23 καὶ οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων συνήχθησαν τοῦ θῦσαι θυσίαν μεγάλην Δαγων τῷ θεῷ αὐτῶν καὶ τοῦ εὐφρανθῆναι καὶ εἶπαν παρέδωκεν ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐν χειρὶ ἡμῶν Σαμψων τὸν ἐχθρὸν ἡμῶν
24 καὶ εἶδεν αὐτὸν ὁ λαὸς καὶ ᾔνεσαν τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπαν παρέδωκεν ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν τὸν ἐχθρὸν ἡμῶν ἐν χειρὶ ἡμῶν καὶ τὸν ἐξερημοῦντα τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν ὅστις ἐπλήθυνεν τοὺς τραυματίας ἡμῶν
25 καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε ἠγαθύνθη ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπαν καλέσατε τὸν Σαμψων ἐξ οἴκου φυλακῆς καὶ παιξάτω ἐνώπιον ἡμῶν καὶ ἐκάλεσαν τὸν Σαμψων ἐξ οἴκου τῆς φυλακῆς καὶ ἐνέπαιζον αὐτῷ καὶ ἔστησαν αὐτὸν ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν δύο στύλων
26 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμψων πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον τὸν χειραγωγοῦντα αὐτόν ἐπανάπαυσόν με δὴ καὶ ποίησον ψηλαφῆσαί με ἐπὶ τοὺς στύλους ἐ{F'} ὧν ὁ οἶκος ἐπεστήρικται ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπιστηρίσομαι ἐ{P'} αὐτούς ὁ δὲ παῖς ἐποίησεν οὕτως

27 ὁ δὲ οἶκος ἦν πλήρης ἀνδρῶν καὶ γυναικῶν καὶ ἐκεῖ πάντες οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος ὡσεὶ τρισχίλιοι ἄνδρες καὶ γυναῖκες ἐμβλέποντες ἐμπαιζόμενον τὸν Σαμψων
28 καὶ ἐβόησεν Σαμψων πρὸς κύριον καὶ εἶπεν κύριε κύριε μνήσθητί μου καὶ ἐνίσχυσόν με δὴ πλὴν ἔτι τὸ ἅπαξ τοῦτο καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐκδίκησιν μίαν ἀντὶ τῶν δύο ὀφθαλμῶν μου ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων
29 καὶ περιέλαβεν Σαμψων τοὺς δύο στύλους τοὺς μέσους ἐ{F'} ὧν ὁ οἶκος ἐπεστήρικτο ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπεστηρίσατο ἐ{P'} αὐτοῖς ἕνα ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕνα ἐν τῇ ἀριστερᾷ αὐτοῦ
30 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμψων ἀποθανέτω ἡ ψυχή μου μετὰ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἔκλινεν ἐν ἰσχύι καὶ ἔπεσεν ὁ οἶκος ἐπὶ τοὺς σατράπας καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν τὸν ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐγένοντο οἱ τεθνηκότες οὓς ἐθανάτωσεν Σαμψων ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ αὐτοῦ πλείους ὑπὲρ οὓς ἐθανάτωσεν ἐν τῇ ζωῇ αὐτοῦ

31 καὶ κατέβησαν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβον αὐτὸν καὶ ἀνέβησαν καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἀνὰ μέσον Σαραα καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Εσθαολ ἐν τῷ τάφῳ Μανωε τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς ἔκρινεν τὸν Ισραηλ εἴκοσι ἔτη
