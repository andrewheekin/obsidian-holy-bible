# Book of Judges 17 (RSVCE)

### Micah and the Levite
1 There was a man of the hill country of Eʹphraim, whose name was Micah.
2 And he said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver which were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “Blessed be my son by theLord.”
3 And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, “I consecrate the silver to theLordfrom my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore I will restore it to you.”
4 So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a graven image and a molten image; and it was in the house of Micah.
5 And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and terʹaphim, and installed one of his sons, who became his priest.
6 In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
7 Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.
8 And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah, to live where he could find a place; and as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Eʹphraim to the house of Micah.
9 And Micah said to him, “From where do you come?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place.”
10 And Micah said to him, “Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, and a suit of apparel, and your living.”
11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man became to him like one of his sons.
12 And Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
13 Then Micah said, “Now I know that theLordwill prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest.”


# Liber Judicum 17 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Fuit eo tempore vir quidam de monte Ephraim nomine Michas,
2 qui dixit matri suæ: Mille et centum argenteos, quos separaveras tibi, et super quibus me audiente juraveras, ecce ego habeo, et apud me sunt. Cui illa respondit: Benedictus filius meus Domino.
3 Reddidit ergo eos matri suæ, quæ dixerat ei: Consecravi et vovi hoc argentum Domino, ut de manu mea suscipiat filius meus, et faciat sculptile atque conflatile: et nunc trado illud tibi.
4 Reddidit igitur eos matri suæ: quæ tulit ducentos argenteos, et dedit eos argentario, ut faceret ex eis sculptile atque conflatile, quod fuit in domo Michæ.
5 Qui ædiculam quoque in ea deo separavit, et fecit ephod, et theraphim, id est, vestem sacerdotalem, et idola: implevitque unius filiorum suorum manum, et factus est ei sacerdos.
6 In diebus illis non erat rex in Israël, sed unusquisque quod sibi rectum videbatur, hoc faciebat.

7 Fuit quoque alter adolescens de Bethlehem Juda, ex cognatione ejus: eratque ipse Levites, et habitabat ibi.
8 Egressusque de civitate Bethlehem, peregrinari voluit ubicumque sibi commodum reperisset. Cumque venisset in montem Ephraim, iter faciens, et declinasset parumper in domum Michæ,
9 interrogatus est ab eo unde venisset. Qui respondit: Levita sum de Bethlehem Juda, et vado ut habitem ubi potuero, et utile mihi esse perspexero.
10 Dixitque Michas: Mane apud me, et esto mihi parens ac sacerdos: daboque tibi per annos singulos decem argenteos, ac vestem duplicem, et quæ ad victum sunt necessaria.
11 Acquievit, et mansit apud hominem, fuitque illi quasi unus de filiis.
12 Implevitque Michas manum ejus, et habuit puerum sacerdotem apud se:
13 Nunc scio, dicens, quod benefaciet mihi Deus habenti Levitici generis sacerdotem.

10 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Μιχα κάθου με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ γενοῦ μοι εἰς πατέρα καὶ εἰς ἱερέα καὶ ἐγὼ δώσω σοι δέκα ἀργυρίου εἰς ἡμέρας καὶ ζεῦγος ἱματίων καὶ τὰ πρὸς τὸ ζῆν σου καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ Λευίτης
11 καὶ ἤρξατο παροικεῖν παρὰ τῷ ἀνδρί καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ τὸ παιδάριον ὡς εἷς τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ
12 καὶ ἐνέπλησεν Μιχα τὴν χεῖρα τοῦ Λευίτου καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ τὸ παιδάριον εἰς ἱερέα καὶ ἦν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Μιχα
13 καὶ εἶπεν Μιχα νῦν ἔγνων ὅτι ἠγαθοποίησέν με κύριος ὅτι ἐγενήθη μοι ὁ Λευίτης εἰς ἱερέα
