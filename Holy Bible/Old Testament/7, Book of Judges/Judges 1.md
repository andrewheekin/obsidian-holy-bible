# Book of Judges 1 (RSVCE)

### Israel’s Failure to Complete the Conquest of Canaan
1 After the death of Joshua the people of Israel inquired of theLord, “Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?”
2 TheLordsaid, “Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand.”
3 And Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into the territory alloted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you.” So Simeon went with him.
4 Then Judah went up and theLordgave the Canaanites and the Perʹizzites into their hand; and they defeated ten thousand of them at Bezek.
5 They came upon Adoʹni-beʹzek at Bezek, and fought against him, and defeated the Canaanites and the Perʹizzites.
6 Adoʹni-beʹzek fled; but they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
7 And Adoʹni-beʹzek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and their great toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has requited me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
8 And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
9 And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland.
10 And Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kirʹiath-arʹba); and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiʹman and Talmai.
11 From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kirʹiath-seʹpher.
12 And Caleb said, “He who attacks Kirʹiath-seʹpher and takes it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as wife.”
13 And Othʹni-el the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
14 When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field; and she alighted from her ass, and Caleb said to her, “What do you wish?”
15 She said to him, “Give me a present; since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water.” And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
16 And the descendants of the Kenʹite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad; and they went and settled with the people.
17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.
18 Judah also took Gaza with its territory, and Ashʹkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.
19 And theLordwas with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain, because they had chariots of iron.
20 And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said; and he drove out from it the three sons of Anak.
21 But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebʹusites who dwelt in Jerusalem; so the Jebʹusites have dwelt with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
22 The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel; and theLordwas with them.
23 And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.)
24 And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, “Pray, show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.”
25 And he showed them the way into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go.
26 And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city, and called its name Luz; that is its name to this day.
27 Manasʹseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-sheʹan and its villages, or Taʹanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibʹleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megidʹdo and its villages; but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.
28 When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.
29 And Eʹphraim did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
30 Zebʹulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Naʹhalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became subject to forced labor.
31 Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob;
32 but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
33 Naphʹtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-sheʹmesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-sheʹmesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.
34 The Amorites pressed the Danites back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain;
35 the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Har-heres, in Aiʹjalon, and in Sha-alʹbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily upon them, and they became subject to forced labor.
36 And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabʹbim, from Sela and upward.


# Liber Judicum 1 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Post mortem Josue, consuluerunt filii Israël Dominum, dicentes: Quis ascendet ante nos contra Chananæum, et erit dux belli?
2 Dixitque Dominus: Judas ascendet: ecce tradidi terram in manus ejus.
3 Et ait Judas Simeoni fratri suo: Ascende mecum in sortem meam, et pugna contra Chananæum, ut et ego pergam tecum in sortem tuam. Et abiit cum eo Simeon.
4 Ascenditque Judas, et tradidit Dominus Chananæum ac Pherezæum in manus eorum: et percusserunt in Bezec decem millia virorum.
5 Inveneruntque Adonibezec in Bezec, et pugnaverunt contra eum, ac percusserunt Chananæum et Pherezæum.
6 Fugit autem Adonibezec: quem persecuti comprehenderunt, cæsis summitatibus manuum ejus ac pedum.
7 Dixitque Adonibezec: Septuaginta reges amputatis manuum ac pedum summitatibus colligebant sub mensa mea ciborum reliquias: sicut feci, ita reddidit mihi Deus. Adduxeruntque eum in Jerusalem, et ibi mortuus est.
8 Oppugnantes ergo filii Juda Jerusalem, ceperunt eam, et percusserunt in ore gladii, tradentes cunctam incendio civitatem.

9 Et postea descendentes pugnaverunt contra Chananæum, qui habitabat in montanis, et ad meridiem, et in campestribus.
10 Pergensque Judas contra Chananæum, qui habitabat in Hebron (cujus nomen fuit antiquitus Cariath Arbe), percussit Sesai, et Ahiman, et Tholmai:
11 atque inde profectus abiit ad habitatores Dabir, cujus nomen vetus erat Cariath Sepher, id est, civitas litterarum.
12 Dixitque Caleb: Qui percusserit Cariath Sepher, et vastaverit eam, dabo ei Axam filiam meam uxorem.
13 Cumque cepisset eam Othoniel filius Cenez frater Caleb minor, dedit ei Axam filiam suam conjugem.
14 Quam pergentem in itinere monuit vir suus ut peteret a patre suo agrum. Quæ cum suspirasset sedens in asino, dixit ei Caleb: Quid habes?
15 At illa respondit: Da mihi benedictionem, quia terram arentem dedisti mihi: da et irriguam aquis. Dedit ergo ei Caleb irriguum superius, et irriguum inferius.
16 Filii autem Cinæi cognati Moysi ascenderunt de civitate palmarum cum filiis Juda, in desertum sortis ejus, quod est ad meridiem Arad, et habitaverunt cum eo.
17 Abiit autem Judas cum Simeone fratre suo, et percusserunt simul Chananæum qui habitabat in Sephaath, et interfecerunt eum. Vocatumque est nomen urbis, Horma, id est, anathema.
18 Cepitque Judas Gazam cum finibus suis, et Ascalonem, atque Accaron cum terminis suis.
19 Fuitque Dominus cum Juda, et montana possedit: nec potuit delere habitatores vallis, quia falcatis curribus abundabant.
20 Dederuntque Caleb Hebron, sicut dixerat Moyses, qui delevit ex ea tres filios Enac.
21 Jebusæum autem habitatorem Jerusalem non deleverunt filii Benjamin: habitavitque Jebusæus cum filiis Benjamin in Jerusalem, usque in præsentem diem.

22 Domus quoque Joseph ascendit in Bethel, fuitque Dominus cum eis.
23 Nam cum obsiderent urbem, quæ prius Luza vocabatur,
24 viderunt hominem egredientem de civitate, dixeruntque ad eum: Ostende nobis introitum civitatis, et faciemus tecum misericordiam.
25 Qui cum ostendisset eis, percusserunt urbem in ore gladii: hominem autem illum, et omnem cognationem ejus, dimiserunt.
26 Qui dimissus, abiit in terram Hetthim, et ædificavit ibi civitatem, vocavitque eam Luzam: quæ ita appellatur usque in præsentem diem.
27 Manasses quoque non delevit Bethsan, et Thanac cum viculis suis, et habitatores Dor, et Jeblaam, et Mageddo cum viculis suis, cœpitque Chananæus habitare cum eis.
28 Postquam autem confortatus est Israël, fecit eos tributarios, et delere noluit.
29 Ephraim etiam non interfecit Chananæum, qui habitabat in Gazer, sed habitavit cum eo.
30 Zabulon non delevit habitatores Cetron, et Naalol: sed habitavit Chananæus in medio ejus, factusque est ei tributarius.
31 Aser quoque non delevit habitatores Accho, et Sidonis, Ahalab, et Achazib, et Helba, et Aphec, et Rohob:
32 habitavitque in medio Chananæi habitatoris illius terræ, nec interfecit eum.
33 Nephthali quoque non delevit habitatores Bethsames, et Bethanath: et habitavit inter Chananæum habitatorem terræ, fueruntque ei Bethsamitæ et Bethanitæ tributarii.
34 Arctavitque Amorrhæus filios Dan in monte, nec dedit eis locum ut ad planiora descenderent:
35 habitavitque in monte Hares, quod interpretatur testaceo, in Ajalon et Salebim. Et aggravata est manus domus Joseph, factusque est ei tributarius.
36 Fuit autem terminus Amorrhæi ab ascensu Scorpionis, petra, et superiora loca.

1 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὴν τελευτὴν Ἰησοῦ καὶ ἐπηρώτων οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἐν κυρίῳ λέγοντες τίς ἀναβήσεται ἡμῖν πρὸς τὸν Χαναναῖον ἀφηγούμενος τοῦ πολεμῆσαι ἐν αὐτῷ
