# Book of Judges 2 (RSVCE)

### Israel’s Disobedience
1 Now the angel of theLordwent up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, “I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you into the land which I swore to give to your fathers. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you,
2 and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed my command. What is this you have done?
3 So now I say, I will not drive them out before you; but they shall become adversaries to you, and their gods shall be a snare to you.”
4 When the angel of theLordspoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.
5 And they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to theLord.
### Death of Joshua
6 When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land.
7 And the people served theLordall the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work which theLordhad done for Israel.
8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of theLord, died at the age of one hundred and ten years.
9 And they buried him within the bounds of his inheritance in Timʹnath-heʹres, in the hill country of Eʹphraim, north of the mountain of Gaʹash.
10 And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, who did not know theLordor the work which he had done for Israel.
### Israel’s Unfaithfulness
11 And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of theLordand served the Baʹals;
12 and they forsook theLord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; they went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed down to them; and they provoked theLordto anger.
13 They forsook theLord, and served the Baʹals and the Ashʹtaroth.
14 So the anger of theLordwas kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them; and he sold them into the power of their enemies round about, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies.
15 Whenever they marched out, the hand of theLordwas against them for evil, as theLordhad warned, and as theLordhad sworn to them; and they were in sore straits.
16 Then theLordraised up judges, who saved them out of the power of those who plundered them.
17 And yet they did not listen to their judges; for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed down to them; they soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of theLord, and they did not do so.
18 Whenever theLordraised up judges for them, theLordwas with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for theLordwas moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them.
19 But whenever the judge died, they turned back and behaved worse than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them; they did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways.
20 So the anger of theLordwas kindled against Israel; and he said, “Because this people have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not obeyed my voice,
21 I will not henceforth drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died,
22 that by them I may test Israel, whether they will take care to walk in the way of theLordas their fathers did, or not.”
23 So theLordleft those nations, not driving them out at once, and he did not give them into the power of Joshua.


# Liber Judicum 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Ascenditque angelus Domini de Galgalis ad Locum flentium, et ait: Eduxi vos de Ægypto, et introduxi in terram, pro qua juravi patribus vestris: et pollicitus sum ut non facerem irritum pactum meum vobiscum in sempiternum,
2 ita dumtaxat ut non feriretis fœdus cum habitatoribus terræ hujus, sed aras eorum subverteretis: et noluistis audire vocem meam: cur hoc fecistis?
3 Quam ob rem nolui delere eos a facie vestra: ut habeatis hostes, et dii eorum sint vobis in ruinam.
4 Cumque loqueretur angelus Domini hæc verba ad omnes filios Israël, elevaverunt ipsi vocem suam, et fleverunt.
5 Et vocatum est nomen loci illius, Locus flentium, sive lacrimarum: immolaveruntque ibi hostias Domini.

6 Dimisit ergo Josue populum, et abierunt filii Israël unusquisque in possessionem suam, ut obtinerent eam:
7 servieruntque Domino cunctis diebus ejus, et seniorum, qui longo post eum vixerunt tempore, et noverant omnia opera Domini quæ fecerat cum Israël.
8 Mortuus est autem Josue filius Nun, famulus Domini, centum et decem annorum,
9 et sepelierunt eum in finibus possessionis suæ in Thamnathsare in monte Ephraim, a septentrionali plaga montis Gaas.
10 Omnisque illa generatio congregata est ad patres suos: et surrexerunt alii, qui non noverant Dominum, et opera quæ fecerat cum Israël.
11 Feceruntque filii Israël malum in conspectu Domini, et servierunt Baalim.
12 Ac dimiserunt Dominum Deum patrum suorum, qui eduxerat eos de terra Ægypti, et secuti sunt deos alienos, deosque populorum, qui habitabant in circuitu eorum, et adoraverunt eos: et ad iracundiam concitaverunt Dominum,
13 dimittentes eum, et servientes Baal et Astaroth.

14 Iratusque Dominus contra Israël, tradidit eos in manus diripientium: qui ceperunt eos, et vendiderunt hostibus qui habitabant per gyrum: nec potuerunt resistere adversariis suis,
15 sed quocumque pergere voluissent, manus Domini super eos erat, sicut locutus est, et juravit eis, et vehementer afflicti sunt.
16 Suscitavitque Dominus judices, qui liberarent eos de vastantium manibus: sed nec eos audire voluerunt,
17 fornicantes cum diis alienis, et adorantes eos. Cito deseruerunt viam, per quam ingressi fuerant patres eorum: et audientes mandata Domini, omnia fecere contraria.
18 Cumque Dominus judices suscitaret, in diebus eorum flectebatur misericordia, et audiebat afflictorum gemitus, et liberabat eos de cæde vastantium.
19 Postquam autem mortuus esset judex, revertebantur, et multo faciebant pejora quam fecerant patres eorum, sequentes deos alienos, servientes eis, et adorantes illos. Non dimiserunt adinventiones suas, et viam durissimam per quam ambulare consueverunt.
20 Iratusque est furor Domini in Israël, et ait: Quia irritum fecit gens ista pactum meum, quod pepigeram cum patribus eorum, et vocem meam audire contempsit:
21 et ego non delebo gentes, quas dimisit Josue, et mortuus est:
22 ut in ipsis experiar Israël, utrum custodiant viam Domini, et ambulent in ea, sicut custodierunt patres eorum, an non.

23 Dimisit ergo Dominus omnes nationes has, et cito subvertere noluit, nec tradidit in manus Josue.

1 καὶ ἀνέβη ἄγγελος κυρίου ἀπὸ Γαλγαλ ἐπὶ τὸν Κλαυθμῶνα καὶ ἐπὶ Βαιθηλ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς κύριος κύριος ἀνεβίβασεν ὑμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ εἰσήγαγεν ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ὤμοσεν τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν τοῦ δοῦναι ὑμῖν καὶ εἶπεν ὑμῖν οὐ διασκεδάσω τὴν διαθήκην μου τὴν με{Q'} ὑμῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
2 καὶ ὑμεῖς οὐ διαθήσεσθε διαθήκην τοῖς ἐγκαθημένοις εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην οὐδὲ τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ προσκυνήσητε ἀλλὰ τὰ γλυπτὰ αὐτῶν συντρίψετε καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτῶν κατασκάψετε καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς μου ὅτε ταῦτα ἐποιήσατε
3 καὶ ἐγὼ εἶπα οὐ προσθήσω τοῦ μετοικίσαι τὸν λαόν ὃν εἶπα τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι αὐτοὺς ἐκ προσώπου ὑμῶν καὶ ἔσονται ὑμῖν εἰς συνοχάς καὶ οἱ θεοὶ αὐτῶν ἔσονται ὑμῖν εἰς σκάνδαλον
4 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐλάλησεν ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου τοὺς λόγους τούτους πρὸς πάντα Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπῆρεν ὁ λαὸς τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκλαυσαν
5 διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου Κλαυθμών καὶ ἔθυσαν ἐκεῖ τῷ κυρίῳ

6 καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν Ἰησοῦς τὸν λαόν καὶ ἀπῆλθαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ τοῦ κατακληρονομῆσαι τὴν γῆν
7 καὶ ἐδούλευσεν ὁ λαὸς τῷ κυρίῳ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Ἰησοῦ καὶ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ὅσοι ἐμακροημέρευσαν μετὰ Ἰησοῦν ὅσοι ἔγνωσαν πᾶν τὸ ἔργον κυρίου τὸ μέγα ὃ ἐποίησεν τῷ Ισραηλ
8 καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυη δοῦλος κυρίου υἱὸς ἑκατὸν δέκα ἐτῶν
9 καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν ὁρίῳ τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ ἐν Θαμναθαρες ἐν ὄρει Εφραιμ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ τοῦ ὄρους Γαας
10 καὶ πᾶσα ἡ γενεὰ ἐκείνη προσετέθησαν πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνέστη γενεὰ ἑτέρα με{T'} αὐτούς ὅσοι οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὸν κύριον καὶ τὸ ἔργον ὃ ἐποίησεν τῷ Ισραηλ
11 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον κυρίου καὶ ἐλάτρευον τοῖς Βααλιμ
12 καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον τὸν κύριον θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν τὸν ἐξαγαγόντα αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων ἀπὸ τῶν θεῶν τῶν λαῶν τῶν περικύκλῳ αὐτῶν καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτοῖς καὶ παρώργισαν τὸν κύριον
13 καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον τὸν κύριον καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν τῇ Βααλ καὶ ταῖς Ἀστάρταις

14 καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ κύριος τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ προνομευόντων καὶ ἐπρονόμευσαν αὐτούς καὶ ἀπέδοτο αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν κυκλόθεν καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνάσθησαν ἀντιστῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν
15 ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐπόρνευον καὶ χεὶρ κυρίου ἦν αὐτοῖς εἰς κακά καθὼς ἐλάλησεν κύριος καὶ καθὼς ὤμοσεν κύριος καὶ ἐξέθλιψεν αὐτοὺς σφόδρα
16 καὶ ἤγειρεν αὐτοῖς κύριος κριτὰς καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν προνομευόντων αὐτούς
17 καί γε τῶν κριτῶν αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐπήκουσαν ὅτι ἐξεπόρνευσαν ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτοῖς καὶ παρώργισαν τὸν κύριον καὶ ἐξέκλιναν ταχὺ ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ ἧς ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν τοῦ εἰσακούειν ἐντολὰς κυρίου οὐκ ἐποίησαν οὕτως
18 καὶ ὅτι ἤγειρεν αὐτοῖς κύριος κριτάς καὶ ἦν κύριος μετὰ τοῦ κριτοῦ καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τοῦ κριτοῦ ὅτι παρεκλήθη κύριος ἀπὸ τοῦ στεναγμοῦ αὐτῶν ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν πολιορκούντων αὐτοὺς καὶ κακούντων αὐτούς
19 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἀπέθνῃσκεν ὁ κριτής καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν καὶ πάλιν διέφθειραν ὑπὲρ τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν πορευθῆναι ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων λατρεύειν αὐτοῖς καὶ προσκυνεῖν αὐτοῖς οὐκ ἀπέρριψαν τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτῶν καὶ οὐκ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτῶν τῆς σκληρᾶς
20 καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ κύριος ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν ἀν{Q'} ὧν ὅσα ἐγκατέλιπαν τὸ ἔθνος τοῦτο τὴν διαθήκην μου ἣν ἐνετειλάμην τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουσαν τῆς φωνῆς μου
21 καὶ ἐγὼ οὐ προσθήσω τοῦ ἐξᾶραι ἄνδρα ἐκ προσώπου αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν κατέλιπεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἀφῆκεν
22 τοῦ πειράσαι ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸν Ισραηλ εἰ φυλάσσονται τὴν ὁδὸν κυρίου πορεύεσθαι ἐν αὐτῇ ὃν τρόπον ἐφυλάξαντο οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν ἢ οὔ

23 καὶ ἀφῆκεν κύριος τὰ ἔθνη ταῦτα τοῦ μὴ ἐξᾶραι αὐτὰ τὸ τάχος καὶ οὐ παρέδωκεν αὐτὰ ἐν χειρὶ Ἰησοῦ
