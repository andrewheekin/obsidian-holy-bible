# Book of Judges 13 (RSVCE)

### The Birth of Samson
1 And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of theLord; and theLordgave them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.
2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoʹah; and his wife was barren and had no children.
3 And the angel of theLordappeared to the woman and said to her, “Behold, you are barren and have no children; but you shall conceive and bear a son.
4 Therefore beware, and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean,
5 for lo, you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from birth; and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”
6 Then the woman came and told her husband, “A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; I did not ask him whence he was, and he did not tell me his name;
7 but he said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son; so then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.’ ”
8 Then Manoʹah entreated theLord, and said, “O,Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again to us, and teach us what we are to do with the boy that will be born.”
9 And God listened to the voice of Manoʹah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoʹah her husband was not with her.
10 And the woman ran in haste and told her husband, “Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.”
11 And Manoʹah arose and went after his wife, and came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to this woman?” And he said, “I am.”
12 And Manoʹah said, “Now when your words come true, what is to be the boy’s manner of life, and what is he to do?”
13 And the angel of theLordsaid to Manoʹah, “Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.
14 She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.”
15 Manoʹah said to the angel of theLord, “Pray, let us detain you, and prepare a kid for you.”
16 And the angel of theLordsaid to Manoʹah, “If you detain me, I will not eat of your food; but if you make ready a burnt offering, then offer it to theLord.” (For Manoʹah did not know that he was the angel of theLord.)
17 And Manoʹah said to the angel of theLord, “What is your name, so that, when your words come true, we may honor you?”
18 And the angel of theLordsaid to him, “Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?”
19 So Manoʹah took the kid with the cereal offering, and offered it upon the rock to theLord, to him who works wonders.
20 And when the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the angel of theLordascended in the flame of the altar while Manoʹah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
21 The angel of theLordappeared no more to Manoʹah and to his wife. Then Manoʹah knew that he was the angel of theLord.
22 And Manoʹah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, for we have seen God.”
23 But his wife said to him, “If theLordhad meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a cereal offering at our hands, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us such things as these.”
24 And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson; and the boy grew, and theLordblessed him.
25 And the Spirit of theLordbegan to stir him in Maʹhaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshʹta-ol.


# Liber Judicum 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Rursumque filii Israël fecerunt malum in conspectu Domini: qui tradidit eos in manus Philisthinorum quadraginta annis.
2 Erat autem quidam vir de Saraa, et de stirpe Dan, nomine Manue, habens uxorem sterilem.
3 Cui apparuit angelus Domini, et dixit ad eam: Sterilis es et absque liberis: sed concipies, et paries filium.
4 Cave ergo ne bibas vinum ac siceram, nec immundum quidquam comedas:
5 quia concipies, et paries filium, cujus non tanget caput novacula: erit enim nazaræus Dei ab infantia sua et ex matris utero, et ipse incipiet liberare Israël de manu Philisthinorum.
6 Quæ cum venisset ad maritum suum, dixit ei: Vir Dei venit ad me, habens vultum angelicum, terribilis nimis. Quem cum interrogassem quis esset, et unde venisset, et quo nomine vocaretur, noluit mihi dicere:
7 sed hoc respondit: Ecce concipies et paries filium: cave ne vinum bibas, nec siceram, et ne aliquo vescaris immundo: erit enim puer nazaræus Dei ab infantia sua, ex utero matris suæ usque ad diem mortis suæ.

8 Oravit itaque Manue Dominum, et ait: Obsecro, Domine, ut vir Dei, quem misisti, veniat iterum, et doceat nos quid debeamus facere de puero, qui nasciturus est.
9 Exaudivitque Dominus deprecantem Manue, et apparuit rursum angelus Dei uxori ejus sedenti in agro: Manue autem maritus ejus non erat cum ea. Quæ cum vidisset angelum,
10 festinavit, et cucurrit ad virum suum: nuntiavitque ei, dicens: Ecce apparuit mihi vir, quem ante videram.
11 Qui surrexit, et secutus est uxorem suam: veniensque ad virum, dixit ei: Tu es qui locutus es mulieri? Et ille respondit: Ego sum.
12 Cui Manue: Quando, inquit, sermo tuus fuerit expletus, quid vis ut faciat puer? aut a quo se observare debebit?
13 Dixitque angelus Domini ad Manue: Ab omnibus, quæ locutus sum uxori tuæ, abstineat se,
14 et quidquid ex vinea nascitur, non comedat: vinum et siceram non bibat; nullo vescatur immundo: et quod ei præcepi, impleat atque custodiat.
15 Dixitque Manue ad angelum Domini: Obsecro te ut acquiescas precibus meis, et faciamus tibi hædum de capris.
16 Cui respondit angelus: Si me cogis, non comedam panes tuos: si autem vis holocaustum facere, offer illud Domino. Et nesciebat Manue quod angelus Domini esset.
17 Dixitque ad eum: Quod est tibi nomen, ut, si sermo tuus fuerit expletus, honoremus te?
18 Cui ille respondit: Cur quæris nomen meum, quod est mirabile?
19 Tulit itaque Manue hædum de capris, et libamenta, et posuit super petram, offerens Domino, qui facit mirabilia: ipse autem et uxor ejus intuebantur.
20 Cumque ascenderet flamma altaris in cælum, angelus Domini pariter in flamma ascendit. Quod cum vidissent Manue et uxor ejus, proni ceciderunt in terram,
21 et ultra eis non apparuit angelus Domini. Statimque intellexit Manue angelum Domini esse,
22 et dixit ad uxorem suam: Morte moriemur, quia vidimus Deum.
23 Cui respondit mulier: Si Dominus nos vellet occidere, de manibus nostris holocaustum et libamenta non suscepisset, nec ostendisset nobis hæc omnia, neque ea quæ sunt ventura dixisset.
24 Peperit itaque filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Samson. Crevitque puer, et benedixit ei Dominus.
25 Cœpitque spiritus Domini esse cum eo in castris Dan inter Saraa et Esthaol.

1 καὶ προσέθεντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον κυρίου καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς κύριος ἐν χειρὶ ἀλλοφύλων τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη
2 καὶ ἐγένετο ἀνὴρ ἐκ Σαραα ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς τοῦ Δαν καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Μανωε καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ στεῖρα καὶ οὐκ ἔτικτεν
3 καὶ ὤφθη ἄγγελος κυρίου πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτήν ἰδοὺ δὴ σὺ στεῖρα καὶ οὐ τέτοκας καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἕξεις καὶ τέξῃ υἱόν
4 καὶ νῦν φύλαξαι καὶ μὴ πίῃς οἶνον καὶ σικερα καὶ μὴ φάγῃς πᾶν ἀκάθαρτον
5 ὅτι ἰδοὺ σὺ ἐν γαστρὶ ἕξεις καὶ τέξῃ υἱόν καὶ οὐκ ἀναβήσεται σίδηρος ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἡγιασμένον ναζιραῖον ἔσται τῷ θεῷ τὸ παιδάριον ἐκ τῆς γαστρός καὶ αὐτὸς ἄρξεται σῴζειν τὸν Ισραηλ ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων
6 καὶ ἦλθεν ἡ γυνὴ καὶ εἶπεν τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς λέγουσα ὅτι ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἦλθεν πρός με καὶ ἡ ὅρασις αὐτοῦ ὡς ὅρασις ἀγγέλου τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπιφανὴς σφόδρα καὶ ἠρώτων πόθεν ἐστίν καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλέν μοι
7 καὶ εἶπέν μοι ἰδοὺ σὺ ἐν γαστρὶ ἕξεις καὶ τέξῃ υἱόν καὶ νῦν μὴ πίῃς οἶνον καὶ σικερα καὶ μὴ φάγῃς πᾶσαν ἀκαθαρσίαν ὅτι ναζιραῖον θεοῦ ἔσται τὸ παιδάριον ἀπὸ τῆς γαστρὸς ἕως ἡμέρας θανάτου αὐτοῦ

8 καὶ ἐδεήθη Μανωε τοῦ κυρίου καὶ εἶπεν ἐν ἐμοί κύριε ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ὃν ἀπέστειλας πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἐλθέτω δὴ πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ φωτισάτω ἡμᾶς τί ποιήσωμεν τῷ παιδαρίῳ τῷ τικτομένῳ
9 καὶ ἐπήκουσεν ὁ θεὸς τῆς φωνῆς Μανωε καὶ παρεγένετο ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ ἔτι πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτῆς καθημένης ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ καὶ Μανωε ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς οὐκ ἦν με{T'} αὐτῆς
10 καὶ ἐτάχυνεν ἡ γυνὴ καὶ ἐξέδραμεν καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν ἰδοὺ ὦπταί μοι ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ἐλθὼν πρός με τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ
11 καὶ ἀνέστη Μανωε καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ λαλήσας πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος ἐγώ
12 καὶ εἶπεν Μανωε νῦν δὴ ἐλθόντος τοῦ ῥήματός σου τί ἔσται τὸ κρίμα τοῦ παιδαρίου καὶ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου πρὸς Μανωε ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν εἶπα πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα φυλαξάσθω
14 ἀπὸ πάντων ὅσα ἐκπορεύεται ἐξ ἀμπέλου οὐ φάγεται καὶ οἶνον καὶ σικερα μὴ πιέτω καὶ πᾶν ἀκάθαρτον μὴ φαγέτω πάντα ὅσα ἐνετειλάμην αὐτῇ φυλαξάσθω
15 καὶ εἶπεν Μανωε πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον κυρίου βιασώμεθα δή σε καὶ ποιήσομεν ἐνώπιόν σου ἔριφον αἰγῶν
16 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου πρὸς Μανωε ἐὰν βιάσῃ με οὐ φάγομαι τῶν ἄρτων σου καὶ ἐὰν ποιήσῃς ὁλοκαύτωμα κυρίῳ ἀνοίσεις αὐτό ὅτι οὐκ ἔγνω Μανωε ὅτι ἄγγελος κυρίου ἐστίν
17 καὶ εἶπεν Μανωε πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον κυρίου τί ὄνομά σοι ἵνα ὅταν ἔλθῃ τὸ ῥῆμά σου δοξάσωμέν σε
18 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου ἵνα τί τοῦτο ἐρωτᾷς τὸ ὄνομά μου καὶ αὐτό ἐστιν θαυμαστόν
19 καὶ ἔλαβεν Μανωε τὸν ἔριφον τῶν αἰγῶν καὶ τὴν θυσίαν καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ἐπὶ τὴν πέτραν τῷ κυρίῳ τῷ θαυμαστὰ ποιοῦντι κυρίῳ καὶ Μανωε καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐθεώρουν
20 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἀναβῆναι τὴν φλόγα ἐπάνωθεν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου ἐν τῇ φλογί καὶ Μανωε καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐθεώρουν καὶ ἔπεσον ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
21 καὶ οὐ προσέθηκεν ἔτι ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου ὀφθῆναι πρὸς Μανωε καὶ πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ τότε ἔγνω Μανωε ὅτι ἄγγελος κυρίου ἐστίν
22 καὶ εἶπεν Μανωε πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ θανάτῳ ἀποθανούμεθα ὅτι θεὸν ἑωράκαμεν
23 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ εἰ ἐβούλετο κύριος θανατῶσαι ἡμᾶς οὐκ ἂν ἐδέξατο ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν ἡμῶν ὁλοκαύτωμα καὶ θυσίαν καὶ οὐκ ἂν ἐφώτισεν ἡμᾶς πάντα ταῦτα καὶ οὐκ ἂν ἀκουστὰ ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν ταῦτα
24 καὶ ἔτεκεν ἡ γυνὴ υἱὸν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Σαμψων καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν κύριος καὶ ηὐξήθη τὸ παιδάριον
25 καὶ ἤρξατο πνεῦμα κυρίου συμπορεύεσθαι αὐτῷ ἐν παρεμβολῇ Δαν ἀνὰ μέσον Σαραα καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Εσθαολ
