# Book of Judges 21 (RSVCE)

### The Benjaminites Saved from Extinction
1 Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, “No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin.”
2 And the people came to Bethel, and sat there till evening before God, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.
3 And they said, “OLord, the God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?”
4 And on the morrow the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
5 And the people of Israel said, “Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to theLord?” For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to theLordto Mizpah, saying, “He shall be put to death.”
6 And the people of Israel had compassion for Benjamin their brother, and said, “One tribe is cut off from Israel this day.
7 What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by theLordthat we will not give them any of our daughters for wives?”
8 And they said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to theLordto Mizpah?” And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jaʹbesh-gilʹead, to the assembly.
9 For when the people were mustered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹead was there.
10 So the congregation sent thither twelve thousand of their bravest men, and commanded them, “Go and smite the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹead with the edge of the sword; also the women and the little ones.
11 This is what you shall do; every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall utterly destroy.”
12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹead four hundred young virgins who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
13 Then the whole congregation sent word to the Benjaminites who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.
14 And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jaʹbesh-gilʹead; but they did not suffice for them.
15 And the people had compassion on Benjamin because theLordhad made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
16 Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?”
17 And they said, “There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel.
18 Yet we cannot give them wives of our daughters.” For the people of Israel had sworn, “Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin.”
19 So they said, “Behold, there is the yearly feast of theLordat Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Leboʹnah.”
20 And they commanded the Benjaminites, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
21 and watch; if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards and seize each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
22 And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously to us; because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.’ ”
23 And the Benjaminites did so, and took their wives, according to their number, from the dancers whom they carried off; then they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the towns, and dwelt in them.
24 And the people of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
25 In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.


# Liber Judicum 21 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Juraverunt quoque filii Israël in Maspha, et dixerunt: Nullus nostrum dabit filiis Benjamin de filiabus suis uxorem.
2 Veneruntque omnes ad domum Dei in Silo, et in conspectu ejus sedentes usque ad vesperam, levaverunt vocem, et magno ululatu cœperunt flere, dicentes:
3 Quare, Domine Deus Israël, factum est hoc malum in populo tuo, ut hodie una tribus auferretur ex nobis?
4 Altera autem die diluculo consurgentes, exstruxerunt altare: obtuleruntque ibi holocausta, et pacificas victimas, et dixerunt:
5 Quis non ascendit in exercitu Domini de universis tribubus Israël? grandi enim juramento se constrinxerant, cum essent in Maspha, interfici eos qui defuissent.
6 Ductique pœnitentia filii Israël super fratre suo Benjamin, cœperunt dicere: Ablata est tribus una de Israël:
7 unde uxores accipient? omnes enim in commune juravimus, non daturos nos his filias nostras.
8 Idcirco dixerunt: Quis est de universis tribubus Israël, qui non ascendit ad Dominum in Maspha? Et ecce inventi sunt habitatores Jabes Galaad in illo exercitu non fuisse.
9 (Eo quoque tempore cum essent in Silo, nullus ex eis ibi repertus est.)

10 Miserunt itaque decem millia viros robustissimos, et præceperunt eis: Ite, et percutite habitatores Jabes Galaad in ore gladii, tam uxores quam parvulos eorum.
11 Et hoc erit quod observare debebitis: omne generis masculini, et mulieres quæ cognoverunt viros, interficite; virgines autem reservate.
12 Inventæque sunt de Jabes Galaad quadringentæ virgines, quæ nescierunt viri thorum: et adduxerunt eas ad castra in Silo, in terram Chanaan.
13 Miseruntque nuntios ad filios Benjamin, qui erant in petra Remmon, et præceperunt eis, ut eos susciperent in pace.
14 Veneruntque filii Benjamin in illo tempore, et datæ sunt eis uxores de filiabus Jabes Galaad: alias autem non repererunt, quas simili modo traderent.
15 Universusque Israël valde doluit, et egit pœnitentiam super interfectione unius tribus ex Israël.
16 Dixeruntque majores natu: Quid faciemus reliquis, qui non acceperunt uxores? omnes in Benjamin feminæ conciderunt,
17 et magna nobis cura, ingentique studio providendum est, ne una tribus deleatur ex Israël.
18 Filias enim nostras eis dare non possumus, constricti juramento et maledictione qua diximus: Maledictus qui dederit de filiabus suis uxorem Benjamin.
19 Ceperuntque consilium, atque dixerunt: Ecce solemnitas Domini est in Silo anniversaria, quæ sita est ad septentrionem urbis Bethel, et ad orientalem plagam viæ, quæ de Bethel tendit ad Sichimam, et ad meridiem oppidi Lebona.
20 Præceperuntque filiis Benjamin, atque dixerunt: Ite, ad latitate in vineis.
21 Cumque videritis filias Silo ad ducendos choros ex more procedere, exite repente de vineis, et rapite ex eis singuli uxores singulas, et pergite in terram Benjamin.
22 Cumque venerint patres earum, ac fratres, et adversum vos queri cœperint atque jurgari, dicemus eis: Miseremini eorum: non enim rapuerunt eas jure bellantium atque victorum: sed rogantibus ut acciperent, non dedistis, et a vestra parte peccatum est.

23 Feceruntque filii Benjamin ut sibi fuerat imperatum: et juxta numerum suum, rapuerunt sibi de his quæ ducebant choros, uxores singulas: abieruntque in possessionem suam ædificantes urbes, et habitantes in eis.
24 Filii quoque Israël reversi sunt per tribus et familias in tabernacula sua. In diebus illis non erat rex in Israël: sed unusquisque quod sibi rectum videbatur, hoc faciebat.

1 καὶ ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ ὤμοσεν ἐν Μασσηφα λέγων ἀνὴρ ἐξ ἡμῶν οὐ δώσει τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ τῷ Βενιαμιν εἰς γυναῖκα
2 καὶ παρεγένοντο πᾶς ὁ λαὸς εἰς Μασσηφα καὶ Βαιθηλ καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐκεῖ ἕως ἑσπέρας ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐπῆραν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκλαυσαν κλαυθμὸν μέγαν
3 καὶ εἶπαν ἵνα τί κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἐγενήθη αὕτη ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ τοῦ ἐπισκεπῆναι σήμερον ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ φυλὴν μίαν
4 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἐπαύριον καὶ ὤρθρισεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον καὶ ἀνήνεγκαν ὁλοκαυτώματα σωτηρίου
5 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τίς ὁ μὴ ἀναβὰς ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ ἐκ πασῶν φυλῶν Ισραηλ πρὸς κύριον ὅτι ὅρκος μέγας ἦν τῷ μὴ ἀναβάντι πρὸς κύριον εἰς Μασσηφα λέγοντες θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖται
6 καὶ παρεκλήθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ περὶ Βενιαμιν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπαν ἀφῄρηται σήμερον φυλὴ μία ἐξ Ισραηλ
7 τί ποιήσωμεν αὐτοῖς τοῖς ὑπολειφθεῖσιν εἰς γυναῖκας καὶ ἡμεῖς ὠμόσαμεν ἐν κυρίῳ τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων ἡμῶν εἰς γυναῖκας
8 καὶ εἶπαν τίς μία τῶν φυλῶν Ισραηλ ἥτις οὐκ ἀνέβη πρὸς κύριον εἰς Μασσηφα καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἦλθεν ἀνὴρ εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν ἀπὸ Ιαβις Γαλααδ εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν
9 καὶ ἐπεσκέπη ὁ λαός καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκεῖ ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τῶν κατοικούντων Ιαβις Γαλααδ

10 καὶ ἀπέστειλαν ἐκεῖ ἡ συναγωγὴ δώδεκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ ἐνετείλαντο αὐτοῖς λέγοντες πορεύθητε καὶ πατάξατε πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ιαβις Γαλααδ ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ τὸν λαόν
11 καὶ οὗτος ὁ λόγος ὃν ποιήσετε πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν καὶ πᾶσαν γυναῖκα γινώσκουσαν κοίτην ἄρσενος ἀναθεματιεῖτε
12 καὶ εὗρον ἀπὸ τῶν κατοικούντων Ιαβις Γαλααδ τετρακοσίας νεάνιδας παρθένους αἳ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ἄνδρα εἰς κοίτην ἄρσενος καὶ ἦγον αὐτὰς εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν εἰς Σηλω ἥ ἐστιν ἐν γῇ Χανααν
13 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ καὶ ἐλάλησαν πρὸς Βενιαμιν τὸν ἐν τῇ πέτρᾳ Ρεμμων καὶ ἐκάλεσαν αὐτοὺς εἰς εἰρήνην
14 καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Βενιαμιν πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτοῖς τὰς γυναῖκας αἵτινες ἦσαν ἐκ τῶν γυναικῶν Ιαβις Γαλααδ καὶ ἤρεσεν αὐτοῖς οὕτως
15 καὶ ὁ λαὸς παρεκλήθη τῷ Βενιαμιν ὅτι ἐποίησεν κύριος διακοπὴν ἐν ταῖς φυλαῖς Ισραηλ
16 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τῆς συναγωγῆς τί ποιήσωμεν τοῖς ἐπιλοίποις εἰς γυναῖκας ὅτι ἠφάνισται ἐκ τοῦ Βενιαμιν γυνή
17 καὶ εἶπαν κληρονομία διασεσῳσμένη τῷ Βενιαμιν καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξαλειφθῇ φυλὴ ἐξ Ισραηλ
18 καὶ ἡμεῖς οὐ δυνησόμεθα δοῦναι αὐτοῖς γυναῖκας ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων ἡμῶν ὅτι ὠμόσαμεν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ λέγοντες ἐπικατάρατος ὁ διδοὺς γυναῖκα τῷ Βενιαμιν
19 καὶ εἶπαν ἑορτὴ τῷ κυρίῳ ἐν Σηλω ἀ{F'} ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας ἥ ἐστιν ἀπὸ βορρᾶ τῆς Βαιθηλ κα{T'} ἀνατολὰς ἡλίου ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τῇ ἀναβαινούσῃ ἐκ Βαιθηλ εἰς Σικιμα καὶ ἀπὸ νότου τοῦ Λιβάνου τῆς Λεβωνα
20 καὶ ἐνετείλαντο τοῖς υἱοῖς Βενιαμιν λέγοντες διέλθατε καὶ ἐνεδρεύσατε ἐν τοῖς ἀμπελῶσιν
21 καὶ ὄψεσθε καὶ ἰδοὺ ὡς ἂν ἐξέλθωσιν αἱ θυγατέρες τῶν κατοικούντων Σηλω ἐν Σηλω χορεῦσαι ἐν χοροῖς καὶ ἐξελεύσεσθε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀμπελώνων καὶ ἁρπάσετε ἀνὴρ ἑαυτῷ γυναῖκα ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων Σηλω καὶ ἀπελεύσεσθε εἰς γῆν Βενιαμιν
22 καὶ ἔσται ὅταν ἔλθωσιν οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν ἢ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν κρίνεσθαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἐροῦμεν πρὸς αὐτούς ἐλεήσατε αὐτούς ὅτι οὐκ ἔλαβον ἀνὴρ γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ οὐ γὰρ ὑμεῖς δεδώκατε αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν ἐπλημμελήσατε

23 καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως οἱ υἱοὶ Βενιαμιν καὶ ἔλαβον γυναῖκας κατὰ τὸν ἀριθμὸν αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῶν χορευουσῶν ἃς διήρπασαν καὶ ἀπῆλθον καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν ἐπὶ τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτῶν καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν ἑαυτοῖς πόλεις καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐν αὐταῖς
24 καὶ περιεπάτησαν ἐκεῖθεν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀνὴρ εἰς τὴν φυλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς τὴν συγγένειαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπῆλθον ἐκεῖθεν ἀνὴρ εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ
