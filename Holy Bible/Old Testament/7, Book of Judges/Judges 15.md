# Book of Judges 15 (RSVCE)

### Samson Defeats the Philistines
1 After a while, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a kid; and he said, “I will go in to my wife in the chamber.” But her father would not allow him to go in.
2 And her father said, “I really thought that you utterly hated her; so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister fairer than she? Pray take her instead.”
3 And Samson said to them, “This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines, when I do them mischief.”
4 So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches; and he turned them tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails.
5 And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards.
6 Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” And they said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” And the Philistines came up, and burned her and her father with fire.
7 And Samson said to them, “If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged upon you, and after that I will quit.”
8 And he smote them hip and thigh with great slaughter; and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
9 Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah, and made a raid on Lehi.
10 And the men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us.”
11 Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” And he said to them, “As they did to me, so have I done to them.”
12 And they said to him, “We have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines.” And Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not fall upon me yourselves.”
13 They said to him, “No; we will only bind you and give you into their hands; we will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
14 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him; and the Spirit of theLordcame mightily upon him, and the ropes which were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands.
15 And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put out his hand and seized it, and with it he slew a thousand men.
16 And Samson said, “With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of an ass have I slain a thousand men.”
17 When he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Raʹmath-leʹhi.
18 And he was very thirsty, and he called on theLordand said, “Thou hast granted this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant; and shall I now die of thirst, and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”
19 And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and there came water from it; and when he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkorʹe; it is at Lehi to this day.
20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.


# Liber Judicum 15 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Post aliquantulum autem temporis, cum dies triticeæ messis instarent, venit Samson, invisere volens uxorem suam, et attulit ei hædum de capris. Cumque cubiculum ejus solito vellet intrare, prohibuit eum pater illius, dicens:
2 Putavi quod odisses eam, et ideo tradidi illam amico tuo: sed habet sororem, quæ junior et pulchrior illa est: sit tibi pro ea uxor.
3 Cui Samson respondit: Ab hac die non erit culpa in me contra Philisthæos: faciam enim vobis mala.
4 Perrexitque et cepit trecentas vulpes, caudasque earum junxit ad caudas, et faces ligavit in medio:
5 quas igne succendens, dimisit ut huc illucque discurrerent. Quæ statim perrexerunt in segetes Philisthinorum. Quibus succensis, et comportatæ jam fruges, et adhuc stantes in stipula, concrematæ sunt, in tantum ut vineas quoque et oliveta flamma consumeret.
6 Dixeruntque Philisthiim: Quis fecit hanc rem? Quibus dictum est: Samson gener Thamnathæi: quia tulit uxorem ejus, et alteri tradidit, hæc operatus est. Ascenderuntque Philisthiim, et combusserunt tam mulierem quam patrem ejus.
7 Quibus ait Samson: Licet hæc feceritis, tamen adhuc ex vobis expetam ultionem, et tunc quiescam.
8 Percussitque eos ingenti plaga, ita ut stupentes suram femori imponerent. Et descendens habitavit in spelunca petræ Etam.
9 Igitur ascendentes Philisthiim in terram Juda, castrametati sunt in loco, qui postea vocatus est Lechi, id est, Maxilla, ubi eorum effusus est exercitus.
10 Dixeruntque ad eos de tribu Juda: Cur ascendistis adversum nos? Qui responderunt: Ut ligemus Samson venimus, et reddamus ei quæ in nos operatus est.
11 Descenderunt ergo tria millia virorum de Juda ad specum silicis Etam, dixeruntque ad Samson: Nescis quod Philisthiim imperent nobis? quare hoc facere voluisti? Quibus ille ait: Sicut fecerunt mihi, sic feci eis.
12 Ligare, inquiunt, te venimus, et tradere in manus Philisthinorum. Quibus Samson: Jurate, ait, et spondete mihi quod non occidatis me.
13 Dixerunt: Non te occidemus, sed vinctum trademus. Ligaveruntque eum duobus novis funibus, et tulerunt eum de petra Etam.

14 Qui cum venisset ad locum Maxillæ, et Philisthiim vociferantes occurrissent ei, irruit spiritus Domini in eum: et sicut solent ad odorem ignis lina consumi, ita vincula, quibus ligatus erat, dissipata sunt et soluta.
15 Inventamque maxillam, id est, mandibulam asini, quæ jacebat, arripiens interfecit in ea mille viros,
16 et ait:In maxilla asini,in mandibula pulli asinarum,delevi eos,et percussi mille viros.
17 Cumque hæc verba canens complesset, projecit mandibulam de manu, et vocavit nomen loci illius Ramathlechi, quod interpretatur, Elevatio maxillæ.
18 Sitiensque valde, clamavit ad Dominum, et ait: Tu dedisti in manu servi tui salutem hanc maximam atque victoriam: en siti morior, incidamque in manus incircumcisorum.
19 Aperuit itaque Dominus molarem dentem in maxilla asini, et egressæ sunt ex eo aquæ. Quibus haustis, refocillavit spiritum, et vires recepit. Idcirco appellatum est nomen loci illius, Fons invocantis de maxilla, usque in præsentem diem.

20 Judicavitque Israël in diebus Philisthiim viginti annis.

1 καὶ ἐγένετο με{Q'} ἡμέρας ἐν ἡμέραις θερισμοῦ πυρῶν καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο Σαμψων τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ φέρων ἔριφον αἰγῶν καὶ εἶπεν εἰσελεύσομαι πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκά μου εἰς τὸν κοιτῶνα καὶ οὐκ ἀφῆκεν αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῆς εἰσελθεῖν πρὸς αὐτήν
2 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῆς εἴπας εἶπα ὅτι μισῶν ἐμίσησας αὐτήν καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτὴν τῷ συνεταίρῳ σου οὐκ ἰδοὺ ἡ ἀδελφὴ αὐτῆς ἡ νεωτέρα κρείσσων αὐτῆς ἐστιν ἔστω δή σοι ἀντὶ αὐτῆς
3 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Σαμψων ἀθῷός εἰμι τὸ ἅπαξ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ὅτι ἐγὼ ποιῶ με{Q'} ὑμῶν κακά
4 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Σαμψων καὶ συνέλαβεν τριακοσίας ἀλώπεκας καὶ ἔλαβεν λαμπάδας καὶ συνέδησεν κέρκον πρὸς κέρκον καὶ ἔθηκεν λαμπάδα μίαν ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν δύο κέρκων ἐν τῷ μέσῳ
5 καὶ ἐξῆψεν πῦρ ἐν ταῖς λαμπάσιν καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν εἰς τὰ δράγματα τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν τοὺς στάχυας καὶ τὰ προτεθερισμένα ἀπὸ στοιβῆς καὶ ἕως ἑστῶτος καὶ ἕως ἀμπελῶνος καὶ ἐλαίας
6 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι τίς ἐποίησεν ταῦτα καὶ εἶπαν Σαμψων ὁ γαμβρὸς τοῦ Θαμναθαίου ὅτι ἔλαβεν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν τῷ συνεταίρῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ αὐτὴν καὶ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῆς ἐν πυρί
7 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαμψων ἐὰν ποιήσητε οὕτως οὐκ εὐδοκήσω ἀλλὰ τὴν ἐκδίκησίν μου ἐξ ἑνὸς καὶ ἑκάστου ὑμῶν ποιήσομαι
8 καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ μηρὸν πληγὴν μεγάλην καὶ κατέβη καὶ κατῴκει παρὰ τῷ χειμάρρῳ ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ Ηταμ
9 καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ παρενεβάλοσαν ἐπὶ τὸν Ιουδαν καὶ ἐξερρίφησαν ἐν Λεχι
10 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ιουδα ἵνα τί ἀνέβητε ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι δῆσαι τὸν Σαμψων καὶ ποιῆσαι αὐτῷ ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν
11 καὶ κατέβησαν τρεῖς χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν ἐξ Ιουδα ἐπὶ τὴν ὀπὴν τῆς πέτρας Ηταμ καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Σαμψων οὐκ οἶδας ὅτι ἄρχουσιν ἡμῶν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ ἵνα τί ταῦτα ἐποίησας ἡμῖν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαμψων καθὼς ἐποίησαν ἡμῖν οὕτως ἐποίησα αὐτοῖς
12 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ τοῦ δῆσαί σε κατέβημεν καὶ παραδοῦναί σε εἰς χεῖρας ἀλλοφύλων καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαμψων ὀμόσατέ μοι μὴ ἀποκτεῖναί με ὑμεῖς καὶ παράδοτέ με αὐτοῖς μήποτε ἀπαντήσητε ὑμεῖς ἐν ἐμοί
13 καὶ ὤμοσαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες οὐχί ἀλλὰ δεσμῷ δήσομέν σε καὶ παραδώσομέν σε εἰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν θανάτῳ δὲ οὐ θανατώσομέν σε καὶ ἔδησαν αὐτὸν δύο καλωδίοις καινοῖς καὶ ἀνήγαγον αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς πέτρας

14 καὶ αὐτὸς ἦλθεν ἕως Σιαγόνος καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἠλάλαξαν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδραμον εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῦ καὶ κατηύθυνεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν πνεῦμα κυρίου καὶ ἐγένοντο τὰ καλώδια τὰ ἐν τοῖς βραχίοσιν αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ στιππύον ἡνίκα ἂν ὀσφρανθῇ πυρός καὶ διελύθησαν οἱ δεσμοὶ ἀπὸ τῶν βραχιόνων αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ εὗρεν σιαγόνα ὄνου ἐρριμμένην ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ἐξέτεινεν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτῇ χιλίους ἄνδρας
16 καὶ εἶπεν Σαμψων ἐν σιαγόνι ὄνου ἐξαλείφων ἐξήλειψα αὐτούς ὅτι ἐν σιαγόνι ὄνου ἐπάταξα χιλίους ἄνδρας
17 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα συνετέλεσεν λαλῶν καὶ ἔρριψεν τὴν σιαγόνα ἀπὸ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸν τόπον ἐκεῖνον Ἀναίρεσις σιαγόνος
18 καὶ ἐδίψησεν σφόδρα καὶ ἐβόησεν πρὸς κύριον καὶ εἶπεν σὺ ἔδωκας ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ δούλου σου τὴν σωτηρίαν τὴν μεγάλην ταύτην καὶ νῦν ἀποθανοῦμαι ἐν δίψει καὶ ἐμπεσοῦμαι ἐν χειρὶ τῶν ἀπεριτμήτων
19 καὶ ἤνοιξεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ τραῦμα τῆς σιαγόνος καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ αὐτοῦ ὕδατα καὶ ἔπιεν καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ἀνέψυξεν διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς Πηγὴ ἐπίκλητος σιαγόνος ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης

20 καὶ ἔκρινεν τὸν Ισραηλ ἐν ἡμέραις ἀλλοφύλων ἔτη εἴκοσι
