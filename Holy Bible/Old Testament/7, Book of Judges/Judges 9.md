# Book of Judges 9 (RSVCE)

### Abimelech Attempts to Establish a Monarchy
1 Now Abimʹelech the son of Jerubbaʹal went to Shechem to his mother’s kinsmen and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother’s family,
2 “Say in the ears of all the citizens of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaʹal rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.”
3 And his mother’s kinsmen spoke all these words on his behalf in the ears of all the men of Shechem; and their hearts inclined to follow Abimʹelech, for they said, “He is our brother.”
4 And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baʹal-beʹrith with which Abimʹelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him.
5 And he went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brothers the sons of Jerubbaʹal, seventy men, upon one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaʹal was left, for he hid himself.
6 And all the citizens of Shechem came together, and all Beth-millo, and they went and made Abimʹelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.
### The Parable of the Trees
7 When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Geriʹzim, and cried aloud and said to them, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.
8 The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’
9 But the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my fatness, by which gods and men are honored, and go to sway over the trees?’
10 And the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come you, and reign over us.’
11 But the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to sway over the trees?’
12 And the trees said to the vine, ‘Come you, and reign over us.’
13 But the vine said to them, ‘Shall I leave my wine which cheers gods and men, and go to sway over the trees?’
14 Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘Come you, and reign over us.’
15 And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’
16 “Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and honor when you made Abimʹelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaʹal and his house, and have done to him as his deeds deserved—
17 for my father fought for you, and risked his life, and rescued you from the hand of Midʹian;
18 and you have risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy men on one stone, and have made Abimʹelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the citizens of Shechem, because he is your kinsman—
19 if you then have acted in good faith and honor with Jerubbaʹal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimʹelech, and let him also rejoice in you;
20 but if not, let fire come out from Abimʹelech, and devour the citizens of Shechem, and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the citizens of Shechem, and from Beth-millo, and devour Abimʹelech.”
21 And Jotham ran away and fled, and went to Beer and dwelt there, for fear of Abimʹelech his brother.
### The Downfall of Abimelech
22 Abimʹelech ruled over Israel three years.
23 And God sent an evil spirit between Abimʹelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimʹelech;
24 that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaʹal might come and their blood be laid upon Abimʹelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brothers.
25 And the men of Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountain tops, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was told Abimʹelech.
26 And Gaʹal the son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his kinsmen; and the men of Shechem put confidence in him.
27 And they went out into the field, and gathered the grapes from their vineyards and trod them, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank and reviled Abimʹelech.
28 And Gaʹal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimʹelech, and who are we of Shechem, that we should serve him? Did not the son of Jerubbaʹal and Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem? Why then should we serve him?
29 Would that this people were under my hand! then I would remove Abimʹelech. I would say to Abimʹelech, ‘Increase your army, and come out.’ ”
30 When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaʹal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
31 And he sent messengers to Abimʹelech at Aruʹmah, saying, “Behold, Gaʹal the son of Ebed and his kinsmen have come to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you.
32 Now therefore, go by night, you and the men that are with you, and lie in wait in the fields.
33 Then in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and rush upon the city; and when he and the men that are with him come out against you, you may do to them as occasion offers.”
34 And Abimʹelech and all the men that were with him rose up by night, and laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
35 And Gaʹal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and Abimʹelech and the men that were with him rose from the ambush.
36 And when Gaʹal saw the men, he said to Zebul, “Look, men are coming down from the mountain tops!” And Zebul said to him, “You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.”
37 Gaʹal spoke again and said, “Look, men are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners’ Oak.”
38 Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your mouth now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimʹelech, that we should serve him?’ Are not these the men whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them.”
39 And Gaʹal went out at the head of the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimʹelech.
40 And Abimʹelech chased him, and he fled before him; and many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate.
41 And Abimʹelech dwelt at Aruʹmah; and Zebul drove out Gaʹal and his kinsmen, so that they could not live on at Shechem.
42 On the following day the men went out into the fields. And Abimʹelech was told.
43 He took his men and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the fields; and he looked and saw the men coming out of the city, and he rose against them and slew them.
44 Abimʹelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies rushed upon all who were in the fields and slew them.
45 And Abimʹelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city, and killed the people that were in it; and he razed the city and sowed it with salt.
46 When all the people of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the house of El-beʹrith.
47 Abimʹelech was told that all the people of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together.
48 And Abimʹelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the men that were with him; and Abimʹelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bundle of brushwood, and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the men that were with him, “What you have seen me do, make haste to do, as I have done.”
49 So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following Abimʹelech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women.
50 Then Abimʹelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the people of the city fled to it, all the men and women, and shut themselves in; and they went to the roof of the tower.
52 And Abimʹelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
53 And a certain woman threw an upper millstone upon Abimʹelech’s head, and crushed his skull.
54 Then he called hastily to the young man his armor-bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest men say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimʹelech was dead, they departed every man to his home.
56 Thus God requited the crime of Abimʹelech, which he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers;
57 and God also made all the wickedness of the men of Shechem fall back upon their heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaʹal.


# Liber Judicum 9 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Abiit autem Abimelech filius Jerobaal in Sichem ad fratres matris suæ, et locutus est ad eos, et ad omnem cognationem domus patris matris suæ, dicens:
2 Loquimini ad omnes viros Sichem: Quid vobis est melius, ut dominentur vestri septuaginta viri omnes filii Jerobaal, an ut dominetur unus vir? simulque considerate quod os vestrum et caro vestra sum.

3 Locutique sunt fratres matris ejus de eo ad omnes viros Sichem universos sermones istos, et inclinaverunt cor eorum post Abimelech, dicentes: Frater noster est.
4 Dederuntque illi septuaginta pondo argenti de fano Baalberit. Qui conduxit sibi ex eo viros inopes et vagos, secutique sunt eum.
5 Et venit in domum patris sui in Ephra, et occidit fratres suos filios Jerobaal, septuaginta viros super lapidem unum: remansitque Joatham filius Jerobaal minimus, et absconditus est.
6 Congregati sunt autem omnes viri Sichem, et universæ familiæ urbis Mello: abieruntque et constituerunt regem Abimelech, juxta quercum quæ stabat in Sichem.

7 Quod cum nuntiatum esset Joatham, ivit, et stetit in vertice montis Garizim: elevataque voce, clamavit, et dixit: Audite me, viri Sichem; ita audiat vos Deus.
8 Ierunt ligna, ut ungerent super se regem: dixeruntque olivæ: Impera nobis.
9 Quæ respondit: Numquid possum deserere pinguedinem meam, qua et dii utuntur et homines, et venire ut inter ligna promovear?
10 Dixeruntque ligna ad arborem ficum: Veni, et super nos regnum accipe.
11 Quæ respondit eis: Numquid possum deserere dulcedinem meam, fructusque suavissimos, et ire ut inter cetera ligna promovear?
12 Locutaque sunt ligna ad vitem: Veni, et impera nobis.
13 Quæ respondit eis: Numquid possum deserere vinum meum, quod lætificat Deum et homines, et inter ligna cetera promoveri?
14 Dixeruntque omnia ligna ad rhamnum: Veni, et impera super nos.
15 Quæ respondit eis: Si vere me regem vobis constituitis, venite, et sub umbra mea requiescite: si autem non vultis, egrediatur ignis de rhamno, et devoret cedros Libani.

16 Nunc igitur, si recte et absque peccato constituistis super vos regem Abimelech, et bene egistis cum Jerobaal, et cum domo ejus, et reddidistis vicem beneficiis ejus, qui pugnavit pro vobis,
17 et animam suam dedit periculis, ut erueret vos de manu Madian,
18 qui nunc surrexistis contra domum patris mei, et interfecistis filios ejus septuaginta viros super unum lapidem, et constituistis regem Abimelech filium ancillæ ejus super habitatores Sichem, eo quod frater vester sit:
19 si ergo recte et absque vitio egistis cum Jerobaal et domo ejus, hodie lætamini in Abimelech, et ille lætetur in vobis.
20 Sin autem perverse: egrediatur ignis ex eo, et consumat habitatores Sichem, et oppidum Mello: egrediaturque ignis de viris Sichem, et de oppido Mello, et devoret Abimelech.
21 Quæ cum dixisset, fugit, et abiit in Bera: habitavitque ibi ob metum Abimelech fratris sui.

22 Regnavit itaque Abimelech super Israël tribus annis.
23 Misitque Dominus spiritum pessimum inter Abimelech et habitatores Sichem: qui cœperunt eum detestari,
24 et scelus interfectionis septuaginta filiorum Jerobaal, et effusionem sanguinis eorum conferre in Abimelech fratrem suum, et in ceteros Sichimorum principes, qui eum adjuverant.
25 Posueruntque insidias adversus eum in summitate montium: et dum illius præstolabantur adventum, exercebant latrocinia, agentes prædas de prætereuntibus: nuntiatumque est Abimelech.
26 Venit autem Gaal filius Obed cum fratribus suis, et transivit in Sichimam. Ad cujus adventum erecti habitatores Sichem,
27 egressi sunt in agros, vastantes vineas, uvasque calcantes: et factis cantantium choris, ingressi sunt fanum dei sui, et inter epulas et pocula maledicebant Abimelech,
28 clamante Gaal filio Obed: Quis est Abimelech, et quæ est Sichem, ut serviamus ei? numquid non est filius Jerobaal, et constituit principem Zebul servum suum super viros Emor patris Sichem? cur ergo serviemus ei?
29 utinam daret aliquis populum istum sub manu mea, ut auferrem de medio Abimelech. Dictumque est Abimelech: Congrega exercitus multitudinem, et veni.
30 Zebul enim princeps civitatis, auditis sermonibus Gaal filii Obed, iratus est valde,
31 et misit clam ad Abimelech nuntios, dicens: Ecce Gaal filius Obed venit in Sichimam cum fratribus suis, et oppugnat adversum te civitatem.
32 Surge itaque nocte cum populo qui tecum est, et latita in agro:
33 et primo mane, oriente sole, irrue super civitatem. Illo autem egrediente adversum te cum populo suo, fac ei quod potueris.
34 Surrexit itaque Abimelech cum omni exercitu suo nocte, et tetendit insidias juxta Sichimam in quatuor locis.

35 Egressusque est Gaal filius Obed, et stetit in introitu portæ civitatis. Surrexit autem Abimelech, et omnis exercitus cum eo, de insidiarum loco.
36 Cumque vidisset populum Gaal, dixit ad Zebul: Ecce de montibus multitudo descendit. Cui ille respondit: Umbras montium vides quasi capita hominum, et hoc errore deciperis.
37 Rursumque Gaal ait: Ecce populus de umbilico terræ descendit, et unus cuneus venit per viam quæ respicit quercum.
38 Cui dixit Zebul: Ubi est nunc os tuum, quo loquebaris: Quis est Abimelech ut serviamus ei? nonne hic populus est, quem despiciebas? egredere, et pugna contra eum.
39 Abiit ergo Gaal, spectante Sichimorum populo, et pugnavit contra Abimelech,
40 qui persecutus est eum fugientem, et in urbem compulit: cecideruntque ex parte ejus plurimi, usque ad portam civitatis.
41 Et Abimelech sedit in Ruma: Zebul autem Gaal et socios ejus expulit de urbe, nec in ea passus est commorari.

42 Sequenti ergo die, egressus est populus in campum. Quod cum nuntiatum esset Abimelech,
43 tulit exercitum suum, et divisit in tres turmas, tendens insidias in agris. Vidensque quod egrederetur populus de civitate, surrexit, et irruit in eos
44 cum cuneo suo, oppugnans et obsidens civitatem: duæ autem turmæ palantes per campum adversarios persequebantur.
45 Porro Abimelech omni die illo oppugnabat urbem: quam cepit, interfectis habitatoribus ejus, ipsaque destructa, ita ut sal in ea dispergeret.

46 Quod cum audissent qui habitabant in turre Sichimorum, ingressi sunt fanum dei sui Berith, ubi fœdus cum eo pepigerant, et ex eo locus nomen acceperat: qui erat munitus valde.
47 Abimelech quoque audiens viros turris Sichimorum pariter conglobatos,
48 ascendit in montem Selmon cum omni populo suo: et arrepta securi, præcidit arboris ramum, impositumque ferens humero, dixit ad socios: Quod me videtis facere, cito facite.
49 Igitur certatim ramos de arboribus præcidentes, sequebantur ducem. Qui circumdantes præsidium, succenderunt: atque ita factum est, ut fumo et igne mille homines necarentur, viri pariter et mulieres, habitatorum turris Sichem.

50 Abimelech autem inde proficiscens venit ad oppidum Thebes, quod circumdans obsidebat exercitu.
51 Erat autem turris excelsa in media civitate, ad quam confugerant simul viri ac mulieres, et omnes principes civitatis, clausa firmissime janua, et super turris tectum stantes per propugnacula.
52 Accedensque Abimelech juxta turrim, pugnabat fortiter: et appropinquans ostio, ignem supponere nitebatur:
53 et ecce una mulier fragmen molæ desuper jaciens, illisit capiti Abimelech, et confregit cerebrum ejus.
54 Qui vocavit cito armigerum suum, et ait ad eum: Evagina gladium tuum, et percute me, ne forte dicatur quod a femina interfectus sim. Qui jussa perficiens, interfecit eum.
55 Illoque mortuo, omnes qui cum eo erant de Israël, reversi sunt in sedes suas:
56 et reddidit Deus malum quod fecerat Abimelech contra patrem suum, interfectis septuaginta fratribus suis.
57 Sichimitis quoque quod operati erant, retributum est, et venit super eos maledictio Joatham filii Jerobaal.


# Κριταί 9 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Αβιμελεχ υἱὸς Ιεροβααλ εἰς Σικιμα πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ πρὸς πᾶσαν τὴν συγγένειαν τοῦ οἴκου τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ λέγων
2 λαλήσατε δὴ ἐν ὠσὶν τῶν ἀνδρῶν Σικιμων ποῖον βέλτιόν ἐστιν τὸ ἄρχειν ὑμῶν ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρας πάντας υἱοὺς Ιεροβααλ ἢ κυριεύειν ὑμῶν ἄνδρα ἕνα καὶ μνήσθητε ὅτι σὰρξ ὑμῶν καὶ ὀστοῦν ὑμῶν ἐγώ εἰμι

3 καὶ ἐλάλησαν περὶ αὐτοῦ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν πάντων τῶν ἀνδρῶν Σικιμων πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ ἔκλινεν καρδία αὐτῶν ὀπίσω Αβιμελεχ ὅτι εἶπαν ἀδελφὸς ἡμῶν ἐστιν
4 καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτῷ ἑβδομήκοντα ἀργυρίου ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου Βααλ διαθήκης καὶ ἐμισθώσατο ἐν αὐτοῖς Αβιμελεχ ἄνδρας κενοὺς καὶ θαμβουμένους καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ
5 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ εἰς Εφραθα καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ υἱοὺς Ιεροβααλ ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρας ἐπὶ λίθον ἕνα καὶ ἀπελείφθη Ιωαθαμ υἱὸς Ιεροβααλ ὁ νεώτερος ὅτι ἐκρύβη
6 καὶ συνήχθησαν πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες Σικιμων καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος Μααλλων καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν τὸν Αβιμελεχ εἰς βασιλέα πρὸς τῇ βαλάνῳ τῆς στάσεως ἐν Σικιμοις

7 καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ Ιωαθαμ καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ τῆς κορυφῆς τοῦ ὄρους Γαριζιν καὶ ἐπῆρεν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἀκούσατέ μου ἄνδρες Σικιμων καὶ ἀκούσαι ὑμῶν ὁ θεός
8 πορευόμενα ἐπορεύθησαν τὰ ξύλα τοῦ χρῖσαι ἑαυτοῖς βασιλέα καὶ εἶπον τῇ ἐλαίᾳ βασίλευσον ἐ{F'} ἡμῶν
9 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἡ ἐλαία ἀφεῖσα τὴν πιότητά μου ἣν ἐν ἐμοὶ ἐδόξασεν ὁ θεὸς καὶ ἄνθρωποι πορευθῶ ἄρχειν τῶν ξύλων
10 καὶ εἶπαν τὰ ξύλα τῇ συκῇ δεῦρο βασίλευσον ἐ{F'} ἡμῶν
11 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἡ συκῆ ἀφεῖσα τὴν γλυκύτητά μου καὶ τὸ γένημά μου τὸ ἀγαθὸν πορευθῶ ἄρχειν ἐπὶ ξύλων

16 καὶ νῦν εἰ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ ἐν τελειότητι ἐποιήσατε καὶ ἐβασιλεύσατε τὸν Αβιμελεχ καὶ εἰ καλῶς ἐποιήσατε μετὰ Ιεροβααλ καὶ μετὰ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰ κατὰ τὸ ἀνταπόδομα τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐποιήσατε αὐτῷ
17 ὡς ἐπολέμησεν ὁ πατήρ μου ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν καὶ ἔρριψεν τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐξ ἐναντίας καὶ ἐξείλατο ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς Μαδιαμ

21 καὶ ἀπέδρα Ιωαθαμ καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ καὶ ἔφυγεν εἰς Ραρα καὶ κατῴκησεν ἐκεῖ ἀπὸ προσώπου Αβιμελεχ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ

22 καὶ ἦρξεν Αβιμελεχ ἐπὶ Ισραηλ τρία ἔτη
23 καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ θεὸς πνεῦμα πονηρὸν ἀνὰ μέσον Αβιμελεχ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ἀνδρῶν Σικιμων καὶ ἠθέτησαν οἱ ἄνδρες Σικιμων ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Αβιμελεχ
24 τοῦ ἐπαγαγεῖν τὴν ἀδικίαν τῶν ἑβδομήκοντα υἱῶν Ιεροβααλ καὶ τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν ἐπιθεῖναι ἐπὶ Αβιμελεχ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτῶν τὸν ἀποκτείναντα αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας Σικιμων τοὺς κατισχύσαντας τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ὥστε ἀποκτεῖναι τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ
25 καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες Σικιμων ἔνεδρα ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς τῶν ὀρέων καὶ ἀνήρπαζον πάντας τοὺς διαπορευομένους ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Αβιμελεχ

27 καὶ ἦλθον εἰς ἀγρὸν καὶ ἐτρύγησαν τοὺς ἀμπελῶνας αὐτῶν καὶ κατεπάτουν καὶ ἐποίησαν χοροὺς καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς οἶκον θεοῦ αὐτῶν καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἔπιον καὶ κατηρῶντο τὸν Αβιμελεχ
28 καὶ εἶπεν Γααλ υἱὸς Αβεδ τί ἐστιν Αβιμελεχ καὶ τίς ἐστιν ὁ υἱὸς Συχεμ ὅτι δουλεύσομεν αὐτῷ οὐχ οὗτος υἱὸς Ιεροβααλ καὶ Ζεβουλ ἐπίσκοπος αὐτοῦ δοῦλος αὐτοῦ σὺν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν Εμμωρ πατρὸς Συχεμ καὶ τί ὅτι δουλεύσομεν αὐτῷ ἡμεῖς

30 καὶ ἤκουσεν Ζεβουλ ὁ ἄρχων τῆς πόλεως τοὺς λόγους Γααλ υἱοῦ Αβεδ καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ
31 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Αβιμελεχ μετὰ δώρων λέγων ἰδοὺ Γααλ υἱὸς Αβεδ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ παραγεγόνασιν εἰς Σικιμα καὶ οἵδε πολιορκοῦσιν τὴν πόλιν ἐπὶ σέ
32 καὶ νῦν ἀνάστηθι νυκτὸς σὺ καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετὰ σοῦ καὶ ἐνέδρευσον ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ
33 καὶ ἔσται τὸ πρωὶ ἅμα τῷ ἀνατεῖλαι τὸν ἥλιον καὶ ὀρθρίσεις καὶ ἐκτενεῖς ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐκπορεύονται πρὸς σέ καὶ ποιήσεις αὐτῷ καθάπερ ἐὰν εὕρῃ ἡ χείρ σου
34 καὶ ἀνέστη Αβιμελεχ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ με{T'} αὐτοῦ νυκτὸς καὶ ἐνήδρευσαν ἐπὶ Σικιμα τέσσαρας ἀρχάς

35 καὶ ἐγένετο πρωὶ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Γααλ υἱὸς Αβεδ καὶ ἔστη πρὸς τῇ θύρᾳ τῆς πύλης τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἀνέστη Αβιμελεχ καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν ἐνέδρων
36 καὶ εἶδεν Γααλ υἱὸς Αβεδ τὸν λαὸν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Ζεβουλ ἰδοὺ λαὸς καταβαίνων ἀπὸ τῶν κορυφῶν τῶν ὀρέων καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ζεβουλ τὴν σκιὰν τῶν ὀρέων σὺ ὁρᾶς ὡς ἄνδρας
37 καὶ προσέθετο ἔτι Γααλ τοῦ λαλῆσαι καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ λαὸς καταβαίνων κατὰ θάλασσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐχόμενα τοῦ ὀμφαλοῦ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἀρχὴ μία παραγίνεται ἀπὸ ὁδοῦ δρυὸς ἀποβλεπόντων
38 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ζεβουλ ποῦ ἐστιν νῦν τὸ στόμα σου τὸ λέγον τίς ἐστιν Αβιμελεχ ὅτι δουλεύσομεν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἰδοὺ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ λαός ὃν ἐξουδένωσας ἔξελθε νῦν καὶ πολέμει πρὸς αὐτόν
39 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Γααλ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν ἀνδρῶν Σικιμων καὶ ἐπολέμησεν ἐν Αβιμελεχ
40 καὶ κατεδίωξεν αὐτὸν Αβιμελεχ καὶ ἔφυγεν ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔπεσον τραυματίαι πολλοὶ ἕως θυρῶν τῆς πόλεως
41 καὶ ἐκάθισεν Αβιμελεχ ἐν Αριμα καὶ ἐξέβαλεν Ζεβουλ τὸν Γααλ καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ τοῦ μὴ οἰκεῖν ἐν Σικιμοις

42 καὶ ἐγενήθη τῇ ἐπαύριον καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς τὸ πεδίον καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Αβιμελεχ
43 καὶ παρέλαβεν τὸν λαὸν καὶ διεῖλεν αὐτὸν τρεῖς ἀρχὰς καὶ ἐνήδρευσεν ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ εἶδεν καὶ ἰδοὺ λαὸς ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐπανέστη αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτούς
44 καὶ Αβιμελεχ καὶ αἱ ἀρχαὶ αἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐξετάθησαν καὶ ἔστησαν παρὰ τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως καὶ αἱ δύο ἀρχαὶ ἐξεχύθησαν ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτούς
45 καὶ Αβιμελεχ ἐπολέμει ἐν τῇ πόλει ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην καὶ κατελάβοντο τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὸν λαὸν τὸν ἐν αὐτῇ ἀνεῖλεν καὶ τὴν πόλιν καθεῖλεν καὶ ἔσπειρεν αὐτὴν ἅλας

46 καὶ ἤκουσαν πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες πύργου Σικιμων καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸ ὀχύρωμα οἴκου τοῦ Βααλ διαθήκης
47 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Αβιμελεχ ὅτι συνήχθησαν πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ πύργου Σικιμων
48 καὶ ἀνέβη Αβιμελεχ εἰς ὄρος Σελμων αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβεν Αβιμελεχ ἀξίνην ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔκοψεν φορτίον ξύλων καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὸ καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τὸν με{T'} αὐτοῦ τί εἴδετέ με ποιοῦντα ταχέως ποιήσατε ὡς καὶ ἐγώ
49 καὶ ἔκοψαν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἕκαστος φορτίον καὶ ἦραν καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω Αβιμελεχ καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπὶ τὸ ὀχύρωμα καὶ ἐνέπρησαν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς τὸ ὀχύρωμα ἐν πυρί καὶ ἀπέθανον πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες πύργου Σικιμων ὡσεὶ χίλιοι ἄνδρες καὶ γυναῖκες

50 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Αβιμελεχ εἰς Θεβες καὶ περιεκάθισεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὴν καὶ προκατελάβετο αὐτήν
51 καὶ πύργος ἦν ὀχυρὸς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἔφυγον ἐκεῖ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες καὶ πάντες οἱ ἡγούμενοι τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν ἐ{F'} ἑαυτοὺς καὶ ἀνέβησαν ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα τοῦ πύργου
52 καὶ ἦλθεν Αβιμελεχ ἕως τοῦ πύργου καὶ ἐξεπολέμησαν αὐτόν καὶ ἤγγισεν Αβιμελεχ ἕως τῆς θύρας τοῦ πύργου ἐμπρῆσαι αὐτὸν ἐν πυρί
53 καὶ ἔρριψεν γυνὴ μία κλάσμα μύλου ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Αβιμελεχ καὶ συνέθλασεν τὸ κρανίον αὐτοῦ
54 καὶ ἐβόησεν τὸ τάχος πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον τὸν αἴροντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ σπάσαι τὴν μάχαιράν σου καὶ θανάτωσόν με μήποτε εἴπωσιν γυνὴ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτόν καὶ ἐξεκέντησεν αὐτὸν τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέθανεν Αβιμελεχ
55 καὶ εἶδεν ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ ὅτι ἀπέθανεν Αβιμελεχ καὶ ἀπῆλθον ἀνὴρ εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ
56 καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν ὁ θεὸς τὴν κακίαν Αβιμελεχ ἣν ἐποίησεν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ ἀποκτεῖναι τοὺς ἑβδομήκοντα ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ
57 καὶ πᾶσαν κακίαν ἀνδρῶν Σικιμων ἐπέστρεψεν ὁ θεὸς εἰς τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπῆλθεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ἡ κατάρα Ιωαθαμ τοῦ υἱοῦ Ιεροβααλ
