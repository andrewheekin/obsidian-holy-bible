# Book of Judges 3 (RSVCE)

### Nations Remaining in the Land
1 Now these are the nations which theLordleft, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had no experience of any war in Canaan;
2 it was only that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, that he might teach war to such at least as had not known it before.
3 These are the nations: the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidoʹnians, and the Hivites who dwelt on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baʹal-herʹmon as far as the entrance of Hamath.
4 They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of theLord, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.
5 So the people of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perʹizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebʹusites;
6 and they took their daughters to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons; and they served their gods.
### Othniel
7 And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of theLord, forgetting theLordtheir God, and serving the Baʹals and the Asheʹroth.
8 Therefore the anger of theLordwas kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cuʹshan-rishathaʹim king of Mesopotaʹmia; and the people of Israel served Cuʹshan-rishathaʹim eight years.
9 But when the people of Israel cried to theLord, theLordraised up a deliverer for the people of Israel, who delivered them, Othʹni-el the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
10 The Spirit of theLordcame upon him, and he judged Israel; he went out to war, and theLordgave Cuʹshan-rishathaʹim king of Mesopotaʹmia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cuʹshan-rishathaʹim.
11 So the land had rest forty years. Then Othʹni-el the son of Kenaz died.
### Ehud
12 And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of theLord; and theLordstrengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of theLord.
13 He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalʹekites, and went and defeated Israel; and they took possession of the city of palms.
14 And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
15 But when the people of Israel cried to theLord, theLordraised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.
16 And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it on his right thigh under his clothes.
17 And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
18 And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people that carried the tribute.
19 But he himself turned back at the sculptured stones near Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he commanded, “Silence.” And all his attendants went out from his presence.
20 And Ehud came to him, as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” And he arose from his seat.
21 And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly;
22 and the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
23 Then Ehud went out into the vestibule, and closed the doors of the roof chamber upon him, and locked them.
24 When he had gone, the servants came; and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, “He is only relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber.”
25 And they waited till they were utterly at a loss; but when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them; and there lay their lord dead on the floor.
26 Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the sculptured stones, and escaped to Se-iʹrah.
27 When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Eʹphraim; and the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, having him at their head.
28 And he said to them, “Follow after me; for theLordhas given your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him, and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and allowed not a man to pass over.
29 And they killed at that time about ten thousand of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped.
30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.
### Shamgar
31 After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred of the Philistines with an oxgoad; and he too delivered Israel.


# Liber Judicum 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Hæ sunt gentes quas Dominus dereliquit, ut erudiret in eis Israëlem, et omnes qui non noverant bella Chananæorum:
2 ut postea discerent filii eorum certare cum hostibus, et habere consuetudinem præliandi:
3 quinque satrapas Philisthinorum, omnemque Chananæum, et Sidonium, atque Hevæum, qui habitabat in monte Libano, de monte Baal Hermon usque ad introitum Emath.
4 Dimisitque eos, ut in ipsis experiretur Israëlem, utrum audiret mandata Domini quæ præceperat patribus eorum per manum Moysi, an non.

5 Itaque filii Israël habitaverunt in medio Chananæi, et Hethæi, et Amorrhæi, et Pherezæi, et Hevæi, et Jebusæi:
6 et duxerunt uxores filias eorum, ipsique filias suas filiis eorum tradiderunt, et servierunt diis eorum.
7 Feceruntque malum in conspectu Domini, et obliti sunt Dei sui, servientes Baalim et Astaroth.
8 Iratusque contra Israël Dominus, tradidit eos in manus Chusan Rasathaim regis Mesopotamiæ, servieruntque ei octo annis.
9 Et clamaverunt ad Dominum, qui suscitavit eis salvatorem, et liberavit eos, Othoniel videlicet filium Cenez, fratrem Caleb minorem:
10 fuitque in eo spiritus Domini, et judicavit Israël. Egressusque est ad pugnam, et tradidit Dominus in manus ejus Chusan Rasathaim regem Syriæ, et oppressit eum.
11 Quievitque terra quadraginta annis, et mortuus est Othoniel filius Cenez.

12 Addiderunt autem filii Israël facere malum in conspectu Domini: qui confortavit adversum eos Eglon regem Moab, quia fecerunt malum in conspectu ejus.
13 Et copulavit ei filios Ammon, et Amalec: abiitque et percussit Israël, atque possedit urbem palmarum.
14 Servieruntque filii Israël Eglon regi Moab decem et octo annis.

15 Et postea clamaverunt ad Dominum, qui suscitavit eis salvatorem vocabulo Aod, filium Gera, filii Jemini, qui utraque manu pro dextera utebatur. Miseruntque filii Israël per illum munera Eglon regi Moab.
16 Qui fecit sibi gladium ancipitem, habentem in medio capulum longitudinis palmæ manus, et accinctus est eo subter sagum in dextro femore.
17 Obtulitque munera Eglon regi Moab. Erat autem Eglon crassus nimis.
18 Cumque obtulisset ei munera, prosecutus est socios, qui cum eo venerant.
19 Et reversus de Galgalis, ubi erant idola, dixit ad regem: Verbum secretum habeo ad te, o rex. Et ille imperavit silentium: egressisque omnibus qui circa eum erant,
20 ingressus est Aod ad eum: sedebat autem in æstivo cœnaculo solus: dixitque: Verbum Dei habeo ad te. Qui statim surrexit de throno.
21 Extenditque Aod sinistram manum, et tulit sicam de dextro femore suo, infixitque eam in ventre ejus
22 tam valide, ut capulus sequeretur ferrum in vulnere, ac pinguissimo adipe stringeretur. Nec eduxit gladium, sed ita ut percusserat, reliquit in corpore: statimque per secreta naturæ alvi stercora proruperunt.
23 Aod autem clausis diligentissime ostiis cœnaculi, et obfirmatis sera,
24 per posticum egressus est. Servique regis ingressi viderunt clausas fores cœnaculi, atque dixerunt: Forsitan purgat alvum in æstivo cubiculo.
25 Expectantesque diu donec erubescerent, et videntes quod nullus aperiret, tulerunt clavem: et aperientes invenerunt dominum suum in terra jacentem mortuum.
26 Aod autem, dum illi turbarentur, effugit, et pertransiit locum idolorum, unde reversus fuerat. Venitque in Seirath:
27 et statim insonuit buccina in monte Ephraim, descenderuntque cum eo filii Israël, ipso in fronte gradiente.
28 Qui dixit ad eos: Sequimini me: tradidit enim Dominus inimicos nostros Moabitas in manus nostras. Descenderuntque post eum, et occupaverunt vada Jordanis quæ transmittunt in Moab: et non dimiserunt transire quemquam:
29 sed percusserunt Moabitas in tempore illo, circiter decem millia, omnes robustos et fortes viros. Nullus eorum evadere potuit.
30 Humiliatusque est Moab in die illo sub manu Israël: et quievit terra octoginta annis.

31 Post hunc fuit Samgar filius Anath, qui percussit de Philisthiim sexcentos viros vomere: et ipse quoque defendit Israël.

1 καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ἔθνη ἀφῆκεν Ἰησοῦς ὥστε πειράσαι ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸν Ισραηλ πάντας τοὺς μὴ ἐγνωκότας πάντας τοὺς πολέμους Χανααν
2 πλὴν διὰ τὰς γενεὰς τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ τοῦ διδάξαι αὐτοὺς πόλεμον πλὴν οἱ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔγνωσαν αὐτά
3 τὰς πέντε σατραπείας τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ πάντα τὸν Χαναναῖον καὶ τὸν Σιδώνιον καὶ τὸν Ευαῖον τὸν κατοικοῦντα τὸν Λίβανον ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ Βαλαερμων ἕως Λοβωημαθ
4 καὶ ἐγένετο ὥστε πειράσαι ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸν Ισραηλ γνῶναι εἰ ἀκούσονται τὰς ἐντολὰς κυρίου ἃς ἐνετείλατο τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ

5 καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ κατῴκησαν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Χαναναίου καὶ τοῦ Χετταίου καὶ τοῦ Αμορραίου καὶ τοῦ Φερεζαίου καὶ τοῦ Ευαίου καὶ τοῦ Ιεβουσαίου
6 καὶ ἔλαβον τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν ἑαυτοῖς εἰς γυναῖκας καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν ἔδωκαν τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῶν καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν
7 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι κυρίου καὶ ἐπελάθοντο κυρίου θεοῦ αὐτῶν καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν ταῖς Βααλιμ καὶ τοῖς ἄλσεσιν
8 καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ κύριος ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ ἀπέδοτο αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας Χουσαρσαθωμ βασιλέως Συρίας ποταμῶν καὶ ἐδούλευσαν αὐτῷ ὀκτὼ ἔτη
9 καὶ ἐκέκραξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πρὸς κύριον καὶ ἤγειρεν κύριος σωτῆρα τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτούς τὸν Γοθονιηλ υἱὸν Κενεζ ἀδελφὸν Χαλεβ τὸν νεώτερον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτοῦ
10 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν πνεῦμα κυρίου καὶ ἔκρινεν τὸν Ισραηλ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν πόλεμον καὶ παρέδωκεν κύριος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὸν Χουσαρσαθωμ βασιλέα Συρίας καὶ ἐκραταιώθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν Χουσαρσαθωμ
11 καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ ἔτη πεντήκοντα καὶ ἀπέθανεν Γοθονιηλ υἱὸς Κενεζ

12 καὶ προσέθεντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι κυρίου καὶ ἐνίσχυσεν κύριος τὸν Εγλωμ βασιλέα Μωαβ ἐπὶ τὸν Ισραηλ διὰ τὸ πεποιηκέναι αὐτοὺς τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι κυρίου
13 καὶ προσήγαγεν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς Αμμων καὶ Αμαληκ καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὸν Ισραηλ καὶ ἐκληρονόμησεν τὴν πόλιν τῶν φοινίκων
14 καὶ ἐδούλευσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τῷ Εγλωμ βασιλεῖ Μωαβ ἔτη δέκα ὀκτώ

15 καὶ ἐκέκραξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πρὸς κύριον καὶ ἤγειρεν αὐτοῖς κύριος σωτῆρα τὸν Αωδ υἱὸν Γηρα υἱοῦ τοῦ Ιεμενι ἄνδρα ἀμφοτεροδέξιον καὶ ἀπέστειλαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ δῶρα ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τῷ Εγλωμ βασιλεῖ Μωαβ
16 καὶ ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ Αωδ μάχαιραν δίστομον σπιθαμῆς τὸ μῆκος καὶ περιεζώσατο αὐτὴν ὑπὸ τὸν μανδύαν ἐπὶ τὸν μηρὸν τὸν δεξιὸν αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ προσήνεγκεν τὰ δῶρα τῷ Εγλωμ βασιλεῖ Μωαβ καὶ Εγλωμ ἀνὴρ ἀστεῖος σφόδρα
18 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς συνετέλεσεν Αωδ προσφέρων τὰ δῶρα καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν τοὺς αἴροντας τὰ δῶρα
19 καὶ Εγλωμ ἀνέστρεψεν ἀπὸ τῶν γλυπτῶν μετὰ τῆς Γαλγαλ καὶ εἶπεν Αωδ λόγος μοι κρύφιος πρὸς σέ βασιλεῦ καὶ εἶπεν Εγλωμ πᾶσιν ἐκ μέσου καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ πάντες οἱ παραστήκοντες αὐτῷ
20 καὶ Αωδ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ ὑπερῴῳ τῷ θερινῷ αὐτοῦ μονώτατος καὶ εἶπεν Αωδ λόγος θεοῦ μοι πρὸς σέ βασιλεῦ καὶ ἐξανέστη ἀπὸ τοῦ θρόνου Εγλωμ ἐγγὺς αὐτοῦ
21 καὶ ἐγένετο ἅμα τοῦ ἀναστῆναι ἐξέτεινεν Αωδ τὴν χεῖρα τὴν ἀριστερὰν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβεν τὴν μάχαιραν ἀπὸ τοῦ μηροῦ τοῦ δεξιοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐνέπηξεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν κοιλίαν Εγλωμ
22 καὶ ἐπεισήνεγκεν καί γε τὴν λαβὴν ὀπίσω τῆς φλογός καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν τὸ στέαρ κατὰ τῆς φλογός ὅτι οὐκ ἐξέσπασεν τὴν μάχαιραν ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας αὐτοῦ
23 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Αωδ εἰς τὴν προστάδα καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν τὰς θύρας τοῦ ὑπερῴου ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν καὶ ἐσφήνωσεν
24 καὶ αὐτὸς ἐξῆλθεν καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ εἰσῆλθον καὶ εἶδον καὶ ἰδοὺ αἱ θύραι τοῦ ὑπερῴου ἀποκεκλεισμέναι καὶ εἶπαν μήποτε πρὸς δίφρους κάθηται ἐν τῇ ἀποχωρήσει τοῦ κοιτῶνος
25 καὶ προσέμειναν αἰσχυνόμενοι καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀνοίγων τὰς θύρας τοῦ ὑπερῴου καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν κλεῖδα καὶ ἤνοιξαν καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ κύριος αὐτῶν πεπτωκὼς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τεθνηκώς
26 καὶ Αωδ διεσώθη ἕως ἐθορυβοῦντο καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ προσνοῶν αὐτῷ καὶ αὐτὸς παρῆλθεν τὰ γλυπτὰ καὶ διεσώθη εἰς Σεϊρωθα
27 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἦλθεν καὶ ἐσάλπισεν κερατίνῃ ἐν ὄρει Εφραιμ καὶ κατέβησαν σὺν αὐτῷ οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ αὐτὸς ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν
28 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς καταβαίνετε ὀπίσω μου ὅτι παρέδωκεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν τὴν Μωαβ ἐν χειρὶ ὑμῶν καὶ κατέβησαν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ καὶ προκατελάβοντο τὰς διαβάσεις τοῦ Ιορδάνου τῆς Μωαβ καὶ οὐκ ἀφῆκαν ἄνδρα διαβῆναι
29 καὶ ἐπάταξαν τὴν Μωαβ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ὡσεὶ δέκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν πάντας τοὺς μαχητὰς τοὺς ἐν αὐτοῖς καὶ πάντα ἄνδρα δυνάμεως καὶ οὐ διεσώθη ἀνήρ
30 καὶ ἐνετράπη Μωαβ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ὑπὸ τὴν χεῖρα Ισραηλ καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ ὀγδοήκοντα ἔτη καὶ ἔκρινεν αὐτοὺς Αωδ ἕως οὗ ἀπέθανεν

31 καὶ μετὰ τοῦτον ἀνέστη Σαμεγαρ υἱὸς Αναθ καὶ ἐπάταξεν τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους εἰς ἑξακοσίους ἄνδρας ἐκτὸς μόσχων τῶν βοῶν καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτὸς τὸν Ισραηλ
