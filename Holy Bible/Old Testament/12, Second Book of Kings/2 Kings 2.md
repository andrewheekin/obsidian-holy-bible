# Second Book of Kings 2 (RSVCE)

### Elijah Ascends to Heaven
1 Now when theLordwas about to take Eliʹjah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Eliʹjah and Eliʹsha were on their way from Gilgal.
2 And Eliʹjah said to Eliʹsha, “Tarry here, I pray you; for theLordhas sent me as far as Bethel.” But Eliʹsha said, “As theLordlives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.
3 And the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Eliʹsha, and said to him, “Do you know that today theLordwill take away your master from over you?” And he said, “Yes, I know it; hold your peace.”
4 Eliʹjah said to him, “Eliʹsha, tarry here, I pray you; for theLordhas sent me to Jericho.” But he said, “As theLordlives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho.
5 The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Eliʹsha, and said to him, “Do you know that today theLordwill take away your master from over you?” And he answered, “Yes, I know it; hold your peace.”
6 Then Eliʹjah said to him, “Tarry here, I pray you; for theLordhas sent me to the Jordan.” But he said, “As theLordlives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on.
7 Fifty men of the sons of the prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan.
8 Then Eliʹjah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the water, and the water was parted to the one side and to the other, till the two of them could go over on dry ground.
9 When they had crossed, Eliʹjah said to Eliʹsha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.” And Eliʹsha said, “I pray you, let me inherit a double share of your spirit.”
10 And he said, “You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if you do not see me, it shall not be so.”
11 And as they still went on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Eliʹjah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
### Elisha Succeeds Elijah
12 And Eliʹsha saw it and he cried, “My father, my father! the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces.
13 And he took up the mantle of Eliʹjah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
14 Then he took the mantle of Eliʹjah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, “Where is theLord, the God of Eliʹjah?” And when he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other; and Eliʹsha went over.
15 Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him over against them, they said, “The spirit of Eliʹjah rests on Eliʹsha.” And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him.
16 And they said to him, “Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men; pray, let them go, and seek your master; it may be that the Spirit of theLordhas caught him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.” And he said, “You shall not send.”
17 But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, “Send.” They sent therefore fifty men; and for three days they sought him but did not find him.
18 And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho, and he said to them, “Did I not say to you, Do not go?”
### Elisha Performs Miracles
19 Now the men of the city said to Eliʹsha, “Behold, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is unfruitful.”
20 He said, “Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him.
21 Then he went to the spring of water and threw salt in it, and said, “Thus says theLord, I have made this water wholesome; henceforth neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it.”
22 So the water has been wholesome to this day, according to the word which Eliʹsha spoke.
23 He went up from there to Bethel; and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”
24 And he turned around, and when he saw them, he cursed them in the name of theLord. And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys.
25 From there he went on to Mount Carmel, and thence he returned to Samarʹia.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem cum levare vellet Dominus Eliam per turbinem in cælum, ibant Elias et Eliseus de Galgalis.
2 Dixitque Elias ad Eliseum: Sede hic, quia Dominus misit me usque in Bethel. Cui ait Eliseus: Vivit Dominus, et vivit anima tua, quia non derelinquam te. Cumque descendissent Bethel,
3 egressi sunt filii prophetarum qui erant in Bethel, ad Eliseum, et dixerunt ei: Numquid nosti quia hodie Dominus tollet dominum tuum a te? Qui respondit: Et ego novi: silete.
4 Dixit autem Elias ad Eliseum: Sede hic, quia Dominus misit me in Jericho. Et ille ait: Vivit Dominus, et vivit anima tua, quia non derelinquam te. Cumque venissent Jericho,
5 accesserunt filii prophetarum qui erant in Jericho, ad Eliseum, et dixerunt ei: Numquid nosti quia Dominus hodie tollet dominum tuum a te? Et ait: Et ego novi: silete.
6 Dixit autem ei Elias: Sede hic, quia Dominus misit me usque ad Jordanem. Qui ait: Vivit Dominus, et vivit anima tua, quia non derelinquam te. Ierunt igitur ambo pariter,
7 et quinquaginta viri de filiis prophetarum secuti sunt eos, qui et steterunt e contra, longe: illi autem ambo stabant super Jordanem.
8 Tulitque Elias pallium suum, et involvit illud, et percussit aquas: quæ divisæ sunt in utramque partem, et transierunt ambo per siccum.
9 Cumque transissent, Elias dixit ad Eliseum: Postula quod vis ut faciam tibi, antequam tollar a te. Dixitque Eliseus: Obsecro ut fiat in me duplex spiritus tuus.
10 Qui respondit: Rem difficilem postulasti: attamen si videris me quando tollar a te, erit tibi quod petisti: si autem non videris, non erit.
11 Cumque pergerent, et incedentes sermocinarentur, ecce currus igneus, et equi ignei diviserunt utrumque: et ascendit Elias per turbinem in cælum.
12 Eliseus autem videbat, et clamabat: Pater mi, pater mi, currus Israël, et auriga ejus. Et non vidit eum amplius: apprehenditque vestimenta sua, et scidit illa in duas partes.
13 Et levavit pallium Eliæ, quod ceciderat ei: reversusque stetit super ripam Jordanis,
14 et pallio Eliæ, quod ceciderat ei, percussit aquas, et non sunt divisæ: et dixit: Ubi est Deus Eliæ etiam nunc? Percussitque aquas, et divisæ sunt huc atque illuc, et transiit Eliseus.

15 Videntes autem filii prophetarum qui erant in Jericho e contra, dixerunt: Requievit spiritus Eliæ super Eliseum. Et venientes in occursum ejus, adoraverunt eum proni in terram,
16 dixeruntque illi: Ecce cum servis tuis sunt quinquaginta viri fortes qui possunt ire, et quærere dominum tuum, ne forte tulerit eum spiritus Domini, et projecerit eum in unum montium, aut in unam vallium. Qui ait: Nolite mittere.
17 Coëgeruntque eum donec acquiesceret, et diceret: Mittite. Et miserunt quinquaginta viros: qui cum quæsissent tribus diebus, non invenerunt.
18 Et reversi sunt ad eum: at ille habitabat in Jericho, et dixit eis: Numquid non dixi vobis: Nolite mittere?

19 Dixerunt quoque viri civitatis ad Eliseum: Ecce habitatio civitatis hujus optima est, sicut tu ipse, domine, perspicis: sed aquæ pessimæ sunt, et terra sterilis.
20 At ille ait: Afferte mihi vas novum, et mittite in illud sal. Quod cum attulissent,
21 egressus ad fontem aquarum misit in illum sal, et ait: Hæc dicit Dominus: Sanavi aquas has, et non erit ultra in eis mors, neque sterilitas.
22 Sanatæ sunt ergo aquæ usque in diem hanc, juxta verbum Elisei quod locutus est.

23 Ascendit autem inde in Bethel: cumque ascenderet per viam, pueri parvi egressi sunt de civitate, et illudebant ei, dicentes: Ascende calve, ascende calve.
24 Qui cum respexisset, vidit eos, et maledixit eis in nomine Domini: egressique sunt duo ursi de saltu, et laceraverunt ex eis quadraginta duos pueros.
25 Abiit autem inde in montem Carmeli, et inde reversus est in Samariam.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 2 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἀνάγειν κύριον τὸν Ηλιου ἐν συσσεισμῷ ὡς εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ηλιου καὶ Ελισαιε ἐκ Γαλγαλων
2 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου πρὸς Ελισαιε κάθου δὴ ἐνταῦθα ὅτι κύριος ἀπέσταλκέν με ἕως Βαιθηλ καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε ζῇ κύριος καὶ ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου εἰ καταλείψω σε καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Βαιθηλ
3 καὶ ἦλθον οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν οἱ ἐν Βαιθηλ πρὸς Ελισαιε καὶ εἶπον πρὸς αὐτόν εἰ ἔγνως ὅτι κύριος σήμερον λαμβάνει τὸν κύριόν σου ἐπάνωθεν τῆς κεφαλῆς σου καὶ εἶπεν κἀγὼ ἔγνωκα σιωπᾶτε
4 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου πρὸς Ελισαιε κάθου δὴ ἐνταῦθα ὅτι κύριος ἀπέσταλκέν με εἰς Ιεριχω καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε ζῇ κύριος καὶ ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου εἰ ἐγκαταλείψω σε καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Ιεριχω
5 καὶ ἤγγισαν οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν οἱ ἐν Ιεριχω πρὸς Ελισαιε καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν εἰ ἔγνως ὅτι σήμερον λαμβάνει κύριος τὸν κύριόν σου ἐπάνωθεν τῆς κεφαλῆς σου καὶ εἶπεν καί γε ἐγὼ ἔγνων σιωπᾶτε
6 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ηλιου κάθου δὴ ὧδε ὅτι κύριος ἀπέσταλκέν με ἕως τοῦ Ιορδάνου καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε ζῇ κύριος καὶ ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου εἰ ἐγκαταλείψω σε καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἀμφότεροι
7 καὶ πεντήκοντα ἄνδρες υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν καὶ ἔστησαν ἐξ ἐναντίας μακρόθεν καὶ ἀμφότεροι ἔστησαν ἐπὶ τοῦ Ιορδάνου
8 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ηλιου τὴν μηλωτὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἵλησεν καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ διῃρέθη τὸ ὕδωρ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα καὶ διέβησαν ἀμφότεροι ἐν ἐρήμῳ
9 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ διαβῆναι αὐτοὺς καὶ Ηλιου εἶπεν πρὸς Ελισαιε αἴτησαι τί ποιήσω σοι πρὶν ἢ ἀναλημφθῆναί με ἀπὸ σοῦ καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε γενηθήτω δὴ διπλᾶ ἐν πνεύματί σου ἐ{P'} ἐμέ
10 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου ἐσκλήρυνας τοῦ αἰτήσασθαι ἐὰν ἴδῃς με ἀναλαμβανόμενον ἀπὸ σοῦ καὶ ἔσται σοι οὕτως καὶ ἐὰν μή οὐ μὴ γένηται
11 καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῶν πορευομένων ἐπορεύοντο καὶ ἐλάλουν καὶ ἰδοὺ ἅρμα πυρὸς καὶ ἵπποι πυρὸς καὶ διέστειλαν ἀνὰ μέσον ἀμφοτέρων καὶ ἀνελήμφθη Ηλιου ἐν συσσεισμῷ ὡς εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν
12 καὶ Ελισαιε ἑώρα καὶ ἐβόα πάτερ πάτερ ἅρμα Ισραηλ καὶ ἱππεὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ εἶδεν αὐτὸν ἔτι καὶ ἐπελάβετο τῶν ἱματίων αὐτοῦ καὶ διέρρηξεν αὐτὰ εἰς δύο ῥήγματα
13 καὶ ὕψωσεν τὴν μηλωτὴν Ηλιου ἣ ἔπεσεν ἐπάνωθεν Ελισαιε καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ελισαιε καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ τοῦ χείλους τοῦ Ιορδάνου
14 καὶ ἔλαβεν τὴν μηλωτὴν Ηλιου ἣ ἔπεσεν ἐπάνωθεν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ οὐ διέστη καὶ εἶπεν ποῦ ὁ θεὸς Ηλιου αφφω καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὰ ὕδατα καὶ διερράγησαν ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα καὶ διέβη Ελισαιε

15 καὶ εἶδον αὐτὸν οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν οἱ ἐν Ιεριχω ἐξ ἐναντίας καὶ εἶπον ἐπαναπέπαυται τὸ πνεῦμα Ηλιου ἐπὶ Ελισαιε καὶ ἦλθον εἰς συναντὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
16 καὶ εἶπον πρὸς αὐτόν ἰδοὺ δὴ μετὰ τῶν παίδων σου πεντήκοντα ἄνδρες υἱοὶ δυνάμεως πορευθέντες δὴ ζητησάτωσαν τὸν κύριόν σου μήποτε ἦρεν αὐτὸν πνεῦμα κυρίου καὶ ἔρριψεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ Ιορδάνῃ ἢ ἐ{F'} ἓν τῶν ὀρέων ἢ ἐ{F'} ἕνα τῶν βουνῶν καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε οὐκ ἀποστελεῖτε
17 καὶ παρεβιάσαντο αὐτὸν ἕως ὅτου ᾐσχύνετο καὶ εἶπεν ἀποστείλατε καὶ ἀπέστειλαν πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας καὶ ἐζήτησαν τρεῖς ἡμέρας καὶ οὐχ εὗρον αὐτόν
18 καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκάθητο ἐν Ιεριχω καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε οὐκ εἶπον πρὸς ὑμᾶς μὴ πορευθῆτε

19 καὶ εἶπον οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως πρὸς Ελισαιε ἰδοὺ ἡ κατοίκησις τῆς πόλεως ἀγαθή καθὼς ὁ κύριος βλέπει καὶ τὰ ὕδατα πονηρὰ καὶ ἡ γῆ ἀτεκνουμένη
20 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε λάβετέ μοι ὑδρίσκην καινὴν καὶ θέτε ἐκεῖ ἅλα καὶ ἔλαβον πρὸς αὐτόν
21 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ελισαιε εἰς τὴν διέξοδον τῶν ὑδάτων καὶ ἔρριψεν ἐκεῖ ἅλα καὶ εἶπεν τάδε λέγει κύριος ἴαμαι τὰ ὕδατα ταῦτα οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι ἐκεῖθεν θάνατος καὶ ἀτεκνουμένη
22 καὶ ἰάθησαν τὰ ὕδατα ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ελισαιε ὃ ἐλάλησεν

23 καὶ ἀνέβη ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Βαιθηλ καὶ ἀναβαίνοντος αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ παιδάρια μικρὰ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καὶ κατέπαιζον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ ἀνάβαινε φαλακρέ ἀνάβαινε
24 καὶ ἐξένευσεν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν καὶ εἶδεν αὐτὰ καὶ κατηράσατο αὐτοῖς ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐξῆλθον δύο ἄρκοι ἐκ τοῦ δρυμοῦ καὶ ἀνέρρηξαν ἐξ αὐτῶν τεσσαράκοντα καὶ δύο παῖδας
25 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκεῖθεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Καρμήλιον καὶ ἐκεῖθεν ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς Σαμάρειαν
