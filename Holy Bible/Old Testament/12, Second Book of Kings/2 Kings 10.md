# Second Book of Kings 10 (RSVCE)

### Massacre of Ahab’s Descendants
1 Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samarʹia. So Jehu wrote letters, and sent them to Samarʹia, to the rulers of the city, to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab, saying,
2 “Now then, as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master’s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities also, and weapons,
3 select the best and fittest of your master’s sons and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”
4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Behold, the two kings could not stand before him; how then can we stand?”
5 So he who was over the palace, and he who was over the city, together with the elders and the guardians, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and we will do all that you bid us. We will not make any one king; do whatever is good in your eyes.”
6 Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you are ready to obey me, take the heads of your master’s sons, and come to me at Jezreʹel tomorrow at this time.” Now the king’s sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were bringing them up.
7 And when the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons, and slew them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezreʹel.
8 When the messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,” he said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.”
9 Then in the morning, when he went out, he stood, and said to all the people, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master, and slew him; but who struck down all these?
10 Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of theLord, which theLordspoke concerning the house of Ahab; for theLordhas done what he said by his servant Eliʹjah.”
11 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreʹel, all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
12 Then he set out and went to Samarʹia. On the way, when he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,
13 Jehu met the kinsmen of Ahaziʹah king of Judah, and he said, “Who are you?” And they answered, “We are the kinsmen of Ahaziʹah, and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother.”
14 He said, “Take them alive.” And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two persons, and he spared none of them.
15 And when he departed from there, he met Jehonʹadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he greeted him, and said to him, “Is your heart true to my heart as mine is to yours?” And Jehonʹadab answered, “It is.” Jehu said, “If it is, give me your hand.” So he gave him his hand. And Jehu took him up with him into the chariot.
16 And he said, “Come with me, and see my zeal for theLord.” So he had him ride in his chariot.
17 And when he came to Samarʹia, he slew all that remained to Ahab in Samarʹia, till he had wiped them out, according to the word of theLordwhich he spoke to Eliʹjah.
### Slaughter of Worshipers of Baal
18 Then Jehu assembled all the people, and said to them, “Ahab served Baʹal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.
19 Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baʹal, all his worshipers and all his priests; let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baʹal; whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu did it with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Baʹal.
20 And Jehu ordered, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baʹal.” So they proclaimed it.
21 And Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baʹal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they entered the house of Baʹal, and the house of Baʹal was filled from one end to the other.
22 He said to him who was in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out the vestments for all the worshipers of Baʹal.” So he brought out the vestments for them.
23 Then Jehu went into the house of Baʹal with Jehonʹadab the son of Rechab; and he said to the worshipers of Baʹal, “Search, and see that there is no servant of theLordhere among you, but only the worshipers of Baʹal.”
24 Then he went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside, and said, “The man who allows any of those whom I give into your hands to escape shall forfeit his life.”
25 So as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the officers, “Go in and slay them; let not a man escape.” So when they put them to the sword, the guard and the officers cast them out and went into the inner room of the house of Baʹal
26 and they brought out the pillar that was in the house of Baʹal, and burned it.
27 And they demolished the pillar of Baʹal, and demolished the house of Baʹal, and made it a latrine to this day.
28 Thus Jehu wiped out Baʹal from Israel.
29 But Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and in Dan.
30 And theLordsaid to Jehu, “Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.”
31 But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of theLordthe God of Israel with all his heart; he did not turn from the sins of Jeroboʹam, which he made Israel to sin.
### Death of Jehu
32 In those days theLordbegan to cut off parts of Israel. Hazʹael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel:
33 from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manasʹsites, from Aroʹer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, that is, Gilead and Bashan.
34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
35 So Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samarʹia. And Jehoʹahaz his son reigned in his stead.
36 The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samarʹia was twenty-eight years.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Erant autem Achab septuaginta filii in Samaria: scripsit ergo Jehu litteras, et misit in Samariam, ad optimates civitatis, et ad majores natu, et ad nutritios Achab, dicens:
2 Statim ut acceperitis litteras has, qui habetis filios domini vestri, et currus, et equos, et civitates firmas, et arma,
3 eligite meliorem, et eum qui vobis placuerit de filiis domini vestri, et eum ponite super solium patris sui, et pugnate pro domo domini vestri.

4 Timuerunt illi vehementer, et dixerunt: Ecce duo reges non potuerunt stare coram eo, et quomodo nos valebimus resistere?
5 Miserunt ergo præpositi domus, et præfecti civitatis, et majores natu, et nutritii, ad Jehu, dicentes: Servi tui sumus: quæcumque jusseris faciemus, nec constituemus nobis regem: quæcumque tibi placent, fac.
6 Rescripsit autem eis litteras secundo, dicens: Si mei estis, et obeditis mihi, tollite capita filiorum domini vestri, et venite ad me hac eadem hora cras in Jezrahel. Porro filii regis, septuaginta viri, apud optimates civitates nutriebantur.
7 Cumque venissent litteras ad eos, tulerunt filios regis, et occiderunt septuaginta viros, et posuerunt capita eorum in cophinis, et miserunt ad eum in Jezrahel.
8 Venit autem nuntius, et indicavit ei, dicens: Attulerunt capita filiorum regis. Qui respondit: Ponite ea ad duos acervos juxta introitum portæ usque mane.
9 Cumque diluxisset, egressus est, et stans dixit ad omnem populum: Justi estis: si ego conjuravi contra dominum meum et interfeci eum, quis percussit omnes hos?
10 videte ergo nunc quoniam non cecidit de sermonibus Domini in terram, quos locutus est Dominus super domum Achab: et Dominus fecit quod locutus est in manu servi sui Eliæ.
11 Percussit igitur Jehu omnes qui reliqui erant de domo Achab in Jezrahel, et universos optimates ejus, et notos, et sacerdotes, donec non remanerent ex eo reliquiæ.

12 Et surrexit, et venit in Samariam: cumque venisset ad Cameram pastorum in via,
13 invenit fratres Ochoziæ regis Juda: dixitque ad eos: Quinam estis vos? Qui responderunt: Fratres Ochoziæ sumus, et descendimus ad salutandos filios regis, et filios reginæ.
14 Qui ait: Comprehendite eos vivos. Quos cum comprehendissent vivos, jugulaverunt eos in cisterna juxta Cameram, quadraginta duos viros: et non reliquit ex eis quemquam.

15 Cumque abiisset inde, invenit Jonadab filium Rechab in occursum sibi, et benedixit ei. Et ait ad eum: Numquid est cor tuum rectum, sicut cor meum cum corde tuo? Et ait Jonadab: Est. Si est, inquit, da manum tuam. Qui dedit ei manum suam. At ille levavit eum ad se in currum:
16 dixitque ad eum: Veni mecum, et vide zelum meum pro Domino. Et impositum in curru suo
17 duxit in Samariam. Et percussit omnes qui reliqui fuerant de Achab in Samaria usque ad unum, juxta verbum Domini quod locutus est per Eliam.

18 Congregavit ergo Jehu omnem populum, et dixit ad eos: Achab coluit Baal parum, ego autem colam eum amplius.
19 Nunc igitur omnes prophetas Baal, et universos servos ejus, et cunctos sacerdotes ipsius vocate ad me: nullus sit qui non veniat: sacrificium enim grande est mihi Baal: quicumque defuerit, non vivet. Porro Jehu faciebat hoc insidiose, ut disperderet cultores Baal.
20 Et dixit: Sanctificate diem solemnem Baal. Vocavitque,
21 et misit in universos terminos Israël, et venerunt cuncti servi Baal: non fuit residuus ne unus quidem qui non veniret. Et ingressi sunt templum Baal: et repleta est domus Baal, a summo usque ad summum.
22 Dixitque his qui erant super vestes: Proferte vestimenta universis servis Baal. Et protulerunt eis vestes.
23 Ingressusque Jehu, et Jonadab filius Rechab, templum Baal, ait cultoribus Baal: Perquirite, et videte, ne quis forte vobiscum sit de servis Domini, sed ut sint servi Baal soli.
24 Ingressi sunt igitur ut facerent victimas et holocausta: Jehu autem præparaverat sibi foris octoginta viros, et dixerat eis: Quicumque fugerit de hominibus his, quos ego adduxero in manus vestras, anima ejus erit pro anima illius.
25 Factum est autem, cum completum esset holocaustum, præcepit Jehu militibus et ducibus suis: Ingredimini, et percutite eos: nullus evadat. Percusseruntque eos in ore gladii, et projecerunt milites et duces: et ierunt in civitatem templi Baal,
26 et protulerunt statuam de fano Baal, et combusserunt,
27 et comminuerunt eam. Destruxerunt quoque ædem Baal, et fecerunt pro ea latrinas usque in diem hanc.

28 Delevit itaque Jehu Baal de Israël:
29 verumtamen a peccatis Jeroboam filii Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël, non recessit, nec dereliquit vitulos aureos qui erant in Bethel et in Dan.
30 Dixit autem Dominus ad Jehu: Quia studiose egisti quod rectum erat, et placebat in oculis meis, et omnia quæ erant in corde meo fecisti contra domum Achab: filii tui usque ad quartam generationem sedebunt super thronum Israël.
31 Porro Jehu non custodivit ut ambularet in lege Domini Dei Israël in toto corde suo: non enim recessit a peccatis Jeroboam, qui peccare fecerat Israël.
32 In diebus illis cœpit Dominus tædere super Israël: percussitque eos Hazaël in universis finibus Israël,
33 a Jordane contra orientalem plagam, omnem terram Galaad, et Gad, et Ruben, et Manasse, ab Aroër, quæ est super torrentem Arnon, et Galaad, et Basan.
34 Reliqua autem verborum Jehu, et universa quæ fecit, et fortitudo ejus, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Israël?
35 Et dormivit Jehu cum patribus suis, sepelieruntque eum in Samaria: et regnavit Joachaz filius ejus pro eo.
36 Dies autem quos regnavit Jehu super Israël, viginti et octo anni sunt in Samaria.

1 καὶ τῷ Αχααβ ἑβδομήκοντα υἱοὶ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ ἔγραψεν Ιου βιβλίον καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας Σαμαρείας καὶ πρὸς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους καὶ πρὸς τοὺς τιθηνοὺς υἱῶν Αχααβ λέγων
2 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἐὰν ἔλθῃ τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο πρὸς ὑμᾶς με{Q'} ὑμῶν οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ κυρίου ὑμῶν καὶ με{Q'} ὑμῶν τὸ ἅρμα καὶ οἱ ἵπποι καὶ πόλεις ὀχυραὶ καὶ τὰ ὅπλα
3 καὶ ὄψεσθε τὸν ἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸν εὐθῆ ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ κυρίου ὑμῶν καὶ καταστήσετε αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ πολεμεῖτε ὑπὲρ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ κυρίου ὑμῶν

4 καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα καὶ εἶπον ἰδοὺ οἱ δύο βασιλεῖς οὐκ ἔστησαν κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ καὶ πῶς στησόμεθα ἡμεῖς
5 καὶ ἀπέστειλαν οἱ ἐπὶ τοῦ οἴκου καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ τῆς πόλεως καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι καὶ οἱ τιθηνοὶ πρὸς Ιου λέγοντες παῖδές σου ἡμεῖς καὶ ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃς πρὸς ἡμᾶς ποιήσομεν οὐ βασιλεύσομεν ἄνδρα τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου ποιήσομεν
6 καὶ ἔγραψεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς βιβλίον δεύτερον λέγων εἰ ἐμοὶ ὑμεῖς καὶ τῆς φωνῆς μου ὑμεῖς εἰσακούετε λάβετε τὴν κεφαλὴν ἀνδρῶν τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ κυρίου ὑμῶν καὶ ἐνέγκατε πρός με ὡς ἡ ὥρα αὔριον εἰς Ιεζραελ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως ἦσαν ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρες οὗτοι ἁδροὶ τῆς πόλεως ἐξέτρεφον αὐτούς
7 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἦλθεν τὸ βιβλίον πρὸς αὐτούς καὶ ἔλαβον τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἔσφαξαν αὐτούς ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρας καὶ ἔθηκαν τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν ἐν καρτάλλοις καὶ ἀπέστειλαν αὐτὰς πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς Ιεζραελ
8 καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ ἄγγελος καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν λέγων ἤνεγκαν τὰς κεφαλὰς τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ εἶπεν θέτε αὐτὰς βουνοὺς δύο παρὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς πύλης εἰς πρωί
9 καὶ ἐγένετο πρωὶ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν καὶ ἔστη ἐν τῷ πυλῶνι τῆς πόλεως καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαόν δίκαιοι ὑμεῖς ἰδοὺ ἐγώ εἰμι συνεστράφην ἐπὶ τὸν κύριόν μου καὶ ἀπέκτεινα αὐτόν καὶ τίς ἐπάταξεν πάντας τούτους
10 ἴδετε αφφω ὅτι οὐ πεσεῖται ἀπὸ τοῦ ῥήματος κυρίου εἰς τὴν γῆν οὗ ἐλάλησεν κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Αχααβ καὶ κύριος ἐποίησεν ὅσα ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ δούλου αὐτοῦ Ηλιου
11 καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ιου πάντας τοὺς καταλειφθέντας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Αχααβ ἐν Ιεζραελ καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἁδροὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς γνωστοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ ὥστε μὴ καταλιπεῖν αὐτοῦ κατάλειμμα

12 καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Σαμάρειαν αὐτὸς ἐν Βαιθακαδ τῶν ποιμένων ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ
13 καὶ Ιου εὗρεν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς Οχοζιου βασιλέως Ιουδα καὶ εἶπεν τίνες ὑμεῖς καὶ εἶπον οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Οχοζιου ἡμεῖς καὶ κατέβημεν εἰς εἰρήνην τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς δυναστευούσης
14 καὶ εἶπεν συλλάβετε αὐτοὺς ζῶντας καὶ συνέλαβον αὐτοὺς ζῶντας καὶ ἔσφαξαν αὐτοὺς εἰς Βαιθακαδ τεσσαράκοντα καὶ δύο ἄνδρας οὐ κατέλιπεν ἄνδρα ἐξ αὐτῶν

15 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκεῖθεν καὶ εὗρεν τὸν Ιωναδαβ υἱὸν Ρηχαβ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτόν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ιου εἰ ἔστιν καρδία σου μετὰ καρδίας μου εὐθεῖα καθὼς ἡ καρδία μου μετὰ τῆς καρδίας σου καὶ εἶπεν Ιωναδαβ ἔστιν καὶ εἶπεν Ιου καὶ εἰ ἔστιν δὸς τὴν χεῖρά σου καὶ ἔδωκεν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὸν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα
16 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν δεῦρο με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ ἰδὲ ἐν τῷ ζηλῶσαί με τῷ κυρίῳ Σαβαωθ καὶ ἐπεκάθισεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ἅρματι αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Σαμάρειαν καὶ ἐπάταξεν πάντας τοὺς καταλειφθέντας τοῦ Αχααβ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἕως τοῦ ἀφανίσαι αὐτὸν κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου ὃ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς Ηλιου

18 καὶ συνήθροισεν Ιου πάντα τὸν λαὸν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς Αχααβ ἐδούλευσεν τῷ Βααλ ὀλίγα καί γε Ιου δουλεύσει αὐτῷ πολλά
19 καὶ νῦν πάντες οἱ προφῆται τοῦ Βααλ πάντας τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ καλέσατε πρός με ἀνὴρ μὴ ἐπισκεπήτω ὅτι θυσία μεγάλη μοι τῷ Βααλ πᾶς ὃς ἐὰν ἐπισκεπῇ οὐ ζήσεται καὶ Ιου ἐποίησεν ἐν πτερνισμῷ ἵνα ἀπολέσῃ τοὺς δούλους τοῦ Βααλ
20 καὶ εἶπεν Ιου ἁγιάσατε ἱερείαν τῷ Βααλ καὶ ἐκήρυξαν
21 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιου ἐν παντὶ Ισραηλ λέγων καὶ νῦν πάντες οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ Βααλ καὶ πάντες οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντες οἱ προφῆται αὐτοῦ μηδεὶς ἀπολειπέσθω ὅτι θυσίαν μεγάλην ποιῶ ὃς ἂν ἀπολειφθῇ οὐ ζήσεται καὶ ἦλθον πάντες οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ Βααλ καὶ πάντες οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντες οἱ προφῆται αὐτοῦ οὐ κατελείφθη ἀνήρ ὃς οὐ παρεγένετο καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Βααλ καὶ ἐπλήσθη ὁ οἶκος τοῦ Βααλ στόμα εἰς στόμα
22 καὶ εἶπεν Ιου τῷ ἐπὶ τοῦ οἴκου μεσθααλ ἐξάγαγε ἐνδύματα πᾶσι τοῖς δούλοις τοῦ Βααλ καὶ ἐξήνεγκεν αὐτοῖς ὁ στολιστής
23 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ιου καὶ Ιωναδαβ υἱὸς Ρηχαβ εἰς οἶκον τοῦ Βααλ καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς δούλοις τοῦ Βααλ ἐρευνήσατε καὶ ἴδετε εἰ ἔστιν με{Q'} ὑμῶν τῶν δούλων κυρίου ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ Βααλ μονώτατοι
24 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὰ θύματα καὶ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ Ιου ἔταξεν ἑαυτῷ ἔξω ὀγδοήκοντα ἄνδρας καὶ εἶπεν ἀνήρ ὃς ἐὰν διασωθῇ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνδρῶν ὧν ἐγὼ ἀνάγω ἐπὶ χεῖρας ὑμῶν ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ ἀντὶ τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ
25 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς συνετέλεσεν ποιῶν τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν καὶ εἶπεν Ιου τοῖς παρατρέχουσιν καὶ τοῖς τριστάταις εἰσελθόντες πατάξατε αὐτούς ἀνὴρ μὴ ἐξελθάτω ἐξ αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτοὺς ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας καὶ ἔρριψαν οἱ παρατρέχοντες καὶ οἱ τριστάται καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἕως πόλεως οἴκου τοῦ Βααλ
26 καὶ ἐξήνεγκαν τὴν στήλην τοῦ Βααλ καὶ ἐνέπρησαν αὐτήν
27 καὶ κατέσπασαν τὰς στήλας τοῦ Βααλ καὶ καθεῖλον τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Βααλ καὶ ἔταξαν αὐτὸν εἰς λυτρῶνας ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης

28 καὶ ἠφάνισεν Ιου τὸν Βααλ ἐξ Ισραηλ
29 πλὴν ἁμαρτιῶν Ιεροβοαμ υἱοῦ Ναβατ ὃς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ οὐκ ἀπέστη Ιου ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν αὐτῶν αἱ δαμάλεις αἱ χρυσαῖ ἐν Βαιθηλ καὶ ἐν Δαν
30 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Ιου ἀν{Q'} ὧν ὅσα ἠγάθυνας ποιῆσαι τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μου ἐποίησας τῷ οἴκῳ Αχααβ υἱοὶ τέταρτοι καθήσονταί σοι ἐπὶ θρόνου Ισραηλ

35 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ιου μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωαχας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
36 καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι ἃς ἐβασίλευσεν Ιου ἐπὶ Ισραηλ εἴκοσι ὀκτὼ ἔτη ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ
