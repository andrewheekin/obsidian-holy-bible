# Second Book of Kings 5 (RSVCE)

### The Healing of Naaman
1 Naʹaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and in high favor, because by him theLordhad given victory to Syria. He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.
2 Now the Syrians on one of their raids had carried off a little maid from the land of Israel, and she waited on Naʹaman’s wife.
3 She said to her mistress, “Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samarʹia! He would cure him of his leprosy.”
4 So Naʹaman went in and told his lord, “Thus and so spoke the maiden from the land of Israel.”
5 And the king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So he went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten festal garments.
6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, “When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you Naʹaman my servant, that you may cure him of his leprosy.”
7 And when the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Only consider, and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me.”
8 But when Eliʹsha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you rent your clothes? Let him come now to me, that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel.”
9 So Naʹaman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the door of Eliʹsha’s house.
10 And Eliʹsha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.”
11 But Naʹaman was angry, and went away, saying, “Behold, I thought that he would surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of theLordhis God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper.
12 Are not Abaʹna and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.
13 But his servants came near and said to him, “My father, if the prophet had commanded you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much rather, then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?”
14 So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
15 Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and he came and stood before him; and he said, “Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; so accept now a present from your servant.”
16 But he said, “As theLordlives, whom I serve, I will receive none.” And he urged him to take it, but he refused.
17 Then Naʹaman said, “If not, I pray you, let there be given to your servant two mules’ burden of earth; for henceforth your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but theLord.
18 In this matter may theLordpardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, leaning on my arm, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, theLordpardon your servant in this matter.”
### Gehazi’s Greed
19 He said to him, “Go in peace.” But when Naʹaman had gone from him a short distance,
20 Gehaʹzi, the servant of Eliʹsha the man of God, said, “See, my master has spared this Naʹaman the Syrian, in not accepting from his hand what he brought. As theLordlives, I will run after him, and get something from him.”
21 So Gehaʹzi followed Naʹaman. And when Naʹaman saw some one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?”
22 And he said, “All is well. My master has sent me to say, ‘There have just now come to me from the hill country of Eʹphraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; pray, give them a talent of silver and two festal garments.’ ”
23 And Naʹaman said, “Be pleased to accept two talents.” And he urged him, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two festal garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they carried them before Gehaʹzi.
24 And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and put them in the house; and he sent the men away, and they departed.
25 He went in, and stood before his master, and Eliʹsha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehaʹzi?” And he said, “Your servant went nowhere.”
26 But he said to him, “Did I not go with you in spirit when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Was it a time to accept money and garments, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants?
27 Therefore the leprosy of Naʹaman shall cleave to you, and to your descendants for ever.” So he went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 5 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Naaman princeps militiæ regis Syriæ erat vir magnus apud dominum suum, et honoratus: per illum enim dedit Dominus salutem Syriæ: erat autem vir fortis et dives, sed leprosus.
2 Porro de Syria egressi fuerant latrunculi, et captivam duxerant de terra Israël puellam parvulam, quæ erat in obsequio uxoris Naaman:
3 quæ ait ad dominam suam: Utinam fuisset dominus meus ad prophetam qui est in Samaria, profecto curasset eum a lepra quam habet.
4 Ingressus est itaque Naaman ad dominum suum, et nuntiavit ei, dicens: Sic et sic locuta est puella de terra Israël.
5 Dixitque ei rex Syriæ: Vade, et mittam litteras ad regem Israël. Qui cum profectus esset, et tulisset secum decem talenta argenti, et sex millia aureos, et decem mutatoria vestimentorum,
6 detulit litteras ad regem Israël in hæc verba: Cum acceperis epistolam hanc, scito quod miserim ad te Naaman servum meum, ut cures eum a lepra sua.
7 Cumque legisset rex Israël litteras, scidit vestimenta sua, et ait: Numquid deus ego sum, ut occidere possim et vivificare, quia iste misit ad me ut curem hominem a lepra sua? animadvertite, et videte quod occasiones quærat adversum me.

8 Quod cum audisset Eliseus vir Dei, scidisse videlicet regem Israël vestimenta sua, misit ad eum, dicens: Quare scidisti vestimenta tua? veniat ad me, et sciat esse prophetam in Israël.
9 Venit ergo Naaman cum equis et curribus, et stetit ad ostium domus Elisei:
10 misitque ad eum Eliseus nuntium, dicens: Vade, et lavare septies in Jordane, et recipiet sanitatem caro tua, atque mundaberis.
11 Iratus Naaman recedebat, dicens: Putabam quod egrederetur ad me, et stans invocaret nomen Domini Dei sui, et tangeret manu sua locum lepræ, et curaret me.
12 Numquid non meliores sunt Abana et Pharphar fluvii Damasci, omnibus aquis Israël, ut laver in eis, et munder? Cum ergo vertisset se, et abiret indignans,
13 accesserunt ad eum servi sui, et locuti sunt ei: Pater, etsi rem grandem dixisset tibi propheta, certe facere debueras: quanto magis quia nunc dixit tibi: Lavare, et mundaberis?
14 Descendit, et lavit in Jordane septies juxta sermonem viri Dei: et restituta est caro ejus sicut caro pueri parvuli, et mundatus est.
15 Reversusque ad virum Dei cum universo comitatu suo, venit, et stetit coram eo, et ait: Vere scio quod non sit alius deus in universa terra, nisi tantum in Israël. Obsecro itaque ut accipias benedictionem a servo tuo.
16 At ille respondit: Vivit Dominus, ante quem sto, quia non accipiam. Cumque vim faceret, penitus non acquievit.
17 Dixitque Naaman: Ut vis: sed, obsecro, concede mihi servo tuo ut tollam onus duorum burdonum de terra: non enim faciet ultra servus tuus holocaustum aut victimam diis alienis, nisi Domino.
18 Hoc autem solum est, de quo depreceris Dominum pro servo tuo, quando ingredietur dominus meus templum Remmon ut adoret: et illo innitente super manum meam, si adoravero in templo Remmon, adorante eo in eodem loco, ut ignoscat mihi Dominus servo tuo pro hac re.
19 Qui dixit ei: Vade in pace. Abiit ergo ab eo electo terræ tempore.

20 Dixitque Giezi puer viri Dei: Pepercit dominus meus Naaman Syro isti, ut non acciperet ab eo quæ attulit: vivit Dominus, quia curram post eum, et accipiam ab eo aliquid.
21 Et secutus est Giezi post tergum Naaman: quem cum vidisset ille currentem ad se, desiliit de curru in occursum ejus, et ait: Rectene sunt omnia?
22 Et ille ait: Recte. Dominus meus misit me ad te dicens: Modo venerunt ad me duo adolescentes de monte Ephraim, ex filiis prophetarum: da eis talentum argenti, et vestes mutatorias duplices.
23 Dixitque Naaman: Melius est ut accipias duo talenta. Et coëgit eum, ligavitque duo talenta argenti in duobus saccis, et duplicia vestimenta, et imposuit duobus pueris suis, qui et portaverunt coram eo.
24 Cumque venisset jam vesperi, tulit de manu eorum, et reposuit in domo, dimisitque viros, et abierunt.
25 Ipse autem ingressus, stetit coram domino suo. Et dixit Eliseus: Unde venis, Giezi? Qui respondit: Non ivit servus tuus quoquam.
26 At ille ait: Nonne cor meum in præsenti erat, quando reversus est homo de curru suo in occursum tui? nunc igitur accepisti argentum, et accepisti vestes ut emas oliveta, et vineas, et oves, et boves, et servos, et ancillas.
27 Sed et lepra Naaman adhærebit tibi, et semini tuo usque in sempiternum. Et egressus est ab eo leprosus quasi nix.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 5 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ Ναιμαν ὁ ἄρχων τῆς δυνάμεως Συρίας ἦν ἀνὴρ μέγας ἐνώπιον τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ καὶ τεθαυμασμένος προσώπῳ ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ ἔδωκεν κύριος σωτηρίαν Συρίᾳ καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ ἦν δυνατὸς ἰσχύι λελεπρωμένος
2 καὶ Συρία ἐξῆλθον μονόζωνοι καὶ ᾐχμαλώτευσαν ἐκ γῆς Ισραηλ νεάνιδα μικράν καὶ ἦν ἐνώπιον τῆς γυναικὸς Ναιμαν
3 ἡ δὲ εἶπεν τῇ κυρίᾳ αὐτῆς ὄφελον ὁ κύριός μου ἐνώπιον τοῦ προφήτου τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ τότε ἀποσυνάξει αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς λέπρας αὐτοῦ
4 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ κυρίῳ ἑαυτῆς καὶ εἶπεν οὕτως καὶ οὕτως ἐλάλησεν ἡ νεᾶνις ἡ ἐκ γῆς Ισραηλ
5 καὶ εἶπεν βασιλεὺς Συρίας πρὸς Ναιμαν δεῦρο εἴσελθε καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ βιβλίον πρὸς βασιλέα Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ ἔλαβεν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ δέκα τάλαντα ἀργυρίου καὶ ἑξακισχιλίους χρυσοῦς καὶ δέκα ἀλλασσομένας στολάς
6 καὶ ἤνεγκεν τὸ βιβλίον πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ισραηλ λέγων καὶ νῦν ὡς ἂν ἔλθῃ τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο πρὸς σέ ἰδοὺ ἀπέστειλα πρὸς σὲ Ναιμαν τὸν δοῦλόν μου καὶ ἀποσυνάξεις αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς λέπρας αὐτοῦ
7 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἀνέγνω βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ τὸ βιβλίον διέρρηξεν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν μὴ θεὸς ἐγὼ τοῦ θανατῶσαι καὶ ζωοποιῆσαι ὅτι οὗτος ἀποστέλλει πρός με ἀποσυνάξαι ἄνδρα ἀπὸ τῆς λέπρας αὐτοῦ ὅτι πλὴν γνῶτε δὴ καὶ ἴδετε ὅτι προφασίζεται οὗτός με

8 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Ελισαιε ὅτι διέρρηξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ τὰ ἱμάτια ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ισραηλ λέγων ἵνα τί διέρρηξας τὰ ἱμάτιά σου ἐλθέτω δὴ πρός με Ναιμαν καὶ γνώτω ὅτι ἔστιν προφήτης ἐν Ισραηλ
9 καὶ ἦλθεν Ναιμαν ἐν ἵππῳ καὶ ἅρματι καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ θύρας οἴκου Ελισαιε
10 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ελισαιε ἄγγελον πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγων πορευθεὶς λοῦσαι ἑπτάκις ἐν τῷ Ιορδάνῃ καὶ ἐπιστρέψει ἡ σάρξ σού σοι καὶ καθαρισθήσῃ
11 καὶ ἐθυμώθη Ναιμαν καὶ ἀπῆλθεν καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ δὴ ἔλεγον ὅτι ἐξελεύσεται πρός με καὶ στήσεται καὶ ἐπικαλέσεται ἐν ὀνόματι θεοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπιθήσει τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον καὶ ἀποσυνάξει τὸ λεπρόν
12 οὐχὶ ἀγαθὸς Αβανα καὶ Φαρφαρ ποταμοὶ Δαμασκοῦ ὑπὲρ Ιορδάνην καὶ πάντα τὰ ὕδατα Ισραηλ οὐχὶ πορευθεὶς λούσομαι ἐν αὐτοῖς καὶ καθαρισθήσομαι καὶ ἐξέκλινεν καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐν θυμῷ
13 καὶ ἤγγισαν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐλάλησαν πρὸς αὐτόν μέγαν λόγον ἐλάλησεν ὁ προφήτης πρὸς σέ οὐχὶ ποιήσεις καὶ ὅτι εἶπεν πρὸς σέ λοῦσαι καὶ καθαρίσθητι
14 καὶ κατέβη Ναιμαν καὶ ἐβαπτίσατο ἐν τῷ Ιορδάνῃ ἑπτάκι κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ελισαιε καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ἡ σὰρξ αὐτοῦ ὡς σὰρξ παιδαρίου μικροῦ καὶ ἐκαθαρίσθη
15 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν πρὸς Ελισαιε αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶσα ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἦλθεν καὶ ἔστη καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ δὴ ἔγνωκα ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν θεὸς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ νῦν λαβὲ τὴν εὐλογίαν παρὰ τοῦ δούλου σου
16 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε ζῇ κύριος ᾧ παρέστην ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ εἰ λήμψομαι καὶ παρεβιάσατο αὐτὸν λαβεῖν καὶ ἠπείθησεν
17 καὶ εἶπεν Ναιμαν καὶ εἰ μή δοθήτω δὴ τῷ δούλῳ σου γόμος ζεύγους ἡμιόνων καὶ σύ μοι δώσεις ἐκ τῆς γῆς τῆς πυρρᾶς ὅτι οὐ ποιήσει ἔτι ὁ δοῦλός σου ὁλοκαύτωμα καὶ θυσίασμα θεοῖς ἑτέροις ἀλ{L'} ἢ τῷ κυρίῳ μόνῳ
18 καὶ ἱλάσεται κύριος τῷ δούλῳ σου ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι τὸν κύριόν μου εἰς οἶκον Ρεμμαν προσκυνῆσαι αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπαναπαύσεται ἐπὶ τῆς χειρός μου καὶ προσκυνήσω ἐν οἴκῳ Ρεμμαν ἐν τῷ προσκυνεῖν αὐτὸν ἐν οἴκῳ Ρεμμαν καὶ ἱλάσεται δὴ κύριος τῷ δούλῳ σου ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ
19 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε πρὸς Ναιμαν δεῦρο εἰς εἰρήνην καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ εἰς δεβραθα τῆς γῆς

20 καὶ εἶπεν Γιεζι τὸ παιδάριον Ελισαιε ἰδοὺ ἐφείσατο ὁ κύριός μου τοῦ Ναιμαν τοῦ Σύρου τούτου τοῦ μὴ λαβεῖν ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ ἃ ἐνήνοχεν ζῇ κύριος ὅτι εἰ μὴ δραμοῦμαι ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ καὶ λήμψομαι πα{R'} αὐτοῦ τι
21 καὶ ἐδίωξε Γιεζι ὀπίσω τοῦ Ναιμαν καὶ εἶδεν αὐτὸν Ναιμαν τρέχοντα ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἅρματος εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτοῦ
22 καὶ εἶπεν εἰρήνη ὁ κύριός μου ἀπέστειλέν με λέγων ἰδοὺ νῦν ἦλθον πρός με δύο παιδάρια ἐξ ὄρους Εφραιμ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῶν προφητῶν δὸς δὴ αὐτοῖς τάλαντον ἀργυρίου καὶ δύο ἀλλασσομένας στολάς
23 καὶ εἶπεν Ναιμαν λαβὲ διτάλαντον ἀργυρίου καὶ ἔλαβεν ἐν δυσὶ θυλάκοις καὶ δύο ἀλλασσομένας στολὰς καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐπὶ δύο παιδάρια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἦραν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ
24 καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὸ σκοτεινόν καὶ ἔλαβεν ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν καὶ παρέθετο ἐν οἴκῳ καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν τοὺς ἄνδρας
25 καὶ αὐτὸς εἰσῆλθεν καὶ παρειστήκει πρὸς τὸν κύριον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ελισαιε πόθεν Γιεζι καὶ εἶπεν Γιεζι οὐ πεπόρευται ὁ δοῦλός σου ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα
26 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ελισαιε οὐχὶ ἡ καρδία μου ἐπορεύθη μετὰ σοῦ ὅτε ἐπέστρεψεν ὁ ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἅρματος εἰς συναντήν σοι καὶ νῦν ἔλαβες τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ νῦν ἔλαβες τὰ ἱμάτια καὶ λήμψῃ ἐν αὐτῷ κήπους καὶ ἐλαιῶνας καὶ ἀμπελῶνας καὶ πρόβατα καὶ βόας καὶ παῖδας καὶ παιδίσκας
27 καὶ ἡ λέπρα Ναιμαν κολληθήσεται ἐν σοὶ καὶ ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ προσώπου αὐτοῦ λελεπρωμένος ὡσεὶ χιών
