# Second Book of Kings 8 (RSVCE)

### The Shunammite Woman’s Land Restored
1 Now Eliʹsha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Arise, and depart with your household, and sojourn wherever you can; for theLordhas called for a famine, and it will come upon the land for seven years.”
2 So the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
3 And at the end of the seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went forth to appeal to the king for her house and her land.
4 Now the king was talking with Gehaʹzi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Tell me all the great things that Eliʹsha has done.”
5 And while he was telling the king how Eliʹsha had restored the dead to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and her land. And Gehaʹzi said, “My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Eliʹsha restored to life.”
6 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an official for her, saying, “Restore all that was hers, together with all the produce of the fields from the day that she left the land until now.”
### Death of Ben-hadad
7 Now Eliʹsha came to Damascus. Ben-haʹdad the king of Syria was sick; and when it was told him, “The man of God has come here,”
8 the king said to Hazʹael, “Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of theLordthrough him, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this sickness?’ ”
9 So Hazʹael went to meet him, and took a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camel loads. When he came and stood before him, he said, “Your son Ben-haʹdad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this sickness?’ ”
10 And Eliʹsha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover’; but theLordhas shown me that he shall certainly die.”
11 And he fixed his gaze and stared at him, until he was ashamed. And the man of God wept.
12 And Hazʹael said, “Why does my lord weep?” He answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel; you will set on fire their fortresses, and you will slay their young men with the sword, and dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.”
13 And Hazʹael said, “What is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?” Eliʹsha answered, “TheLordhas shown me that you are to be king over Syria.”
14 Then he departed from Eliʹsha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Eliʹsha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me that you would certainly recover.”
15 But on the morrow he took the coverlet and dipped it in water and spread it over his face, till he died. And Hazʹael became king in his stead.
### Jehoram Reigns over Judah
16 In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehorʹam the son of Jehoshʹaphat, king of Judah, began to reign.
17 He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord.
19 Yet theLordwould not destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, since he promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons for ever.
20 In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah, and set up a king of their own.
21 Then Joram passed over to Zaʹir with all his chariots, and rose by night, and he and his chariot commanders smote the Eʹdomites who had surrounded him; but his army fled home.
22 So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
23 Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
24 So Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziʹah his son reigned in his stead.
### Ahaziah Reigns over Judah
25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziʹah the son of Jehorʹam, king of Judah, began to reign.
26 Ahaziʹah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliʹah; she was a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
27 He also walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did what was evil in the sight of theLord, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was son-in-law to the house of Ahab.
28 He went with Joram the son of Ahab to make war against Hazʹael king of Syria at Raʹmoth-gilʹead, where the Syrians wounded Joram.
29 And King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreʹel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazʹael king of Syria. And Ahaziʹah the son of Jehorʹam king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreʹel, because he was sick.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 8 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Eliseus autem locutus est ad mulierem cujus vivere fecerat filium, dicens: Surge, vade tu et domus tua, et peregrinare ubicumque repereris: vocavit enim Dominus famem, et veniet super terram septem annis.
2 Quæ surrexit, et fecit juxta verbum hominis Dei: et vadens cum domo sua, peregrinata est in terra Philisthiim diebus multis.
3 Cumque finiti essent anni septem, reversa est mulier de terra Philisthiim: et egressa est ut interpellaret regem pro domo sua, et pro agris suis.
4 Rex autem loquebatur cum Giezi puero viri Dei, dicens: Narra mihi omnia magnalia quæ fecit Eliseus.
5 Cumque ille narraret regi quomodo mortuum suscitasset, apparuit mulier cujus vivificaverat filium, clamans ad regem pro domo sua, et pro agris suis. Dixitque Giezi: Domine mi rex, hæc est mulier, et hic est filius ejus quem suscitavit Eliseus.
6 Et interrogavit rex mulierem: quæ narravit ei. Deditque ei rex eunuchum unum, dicens: Restitue ei omnia quæ sua sunt, et universos reditus agrorum, a die qua reliquit terram usque ad præsens.

7 Venit quoque Eliseus Damascum, et Benadad rex Syriæ ægrotabat: nuntiaveruntque ei, dicentes: Venit vir Dei huc.
8 Et ait rex ad Hazaël: Tolle tecum munera, et vade in occursum viri Dei, et consule Dominum per eum, dicens: Si evadere potero de infirmitate mea hac?
9 Ivit igitur Hazaël in occursum ejus, habens secum munera, et omnia bona Damasci, onera quadraginta camelorum. Cumque stetisset coram eo, ait: Filius tuus Benadad rex Syriæ misit me ad te, dicens: Si sanari potero de infirmitate mea hac?
10 Dixitque ei Eliseus: Vade, dic ei: Sanaberis: porro ostendit mihi Dominus quia morte morietur.
11 Stetique cum eo, et conturbatus est usque ad suffusionem vultus: flevitque vir Dei.
12 Cui Hazaël ait: Quare dominus meus flet? At ille dixit: Quia scio quæ facturus sis filiis Israël mala. Civitates eorum munitas igne succendes, et juvenes eorum interficies gladio, et parvulos eorum elides, et prægnantes divides.
13 Dixitque Hazaël: Quid enim sum servus tuus canis, ut faciam rem istam magnam? Et ait Eliseus: Ostendit mihi Dominus te regem Syriæ fore.
14 Qui cum recessisset ab Eliseo, venit ad dominum suum. Qui ait ei: Quid dixit tibi Eliseus? At ille respondit: Dixit mihi: Recipies sanitatem.
15 Cumque venisset dies altera, tulit stragulum, et infudit aquam, et expandit super faciem ejus: quo mortuo, regnavit Hazaël pro eo.

16 Anno quinto Joram filii Achab regis Israël, et Josaphat regis Juda, regnavit Joram filius Josaphat rex Juda.
17 Triginta duorum annorum erat cum regnare cœpisset, et octo annis regnavit in Jerusalem.
18 Ambulavitque in viis regum Israël, sicut ambulaverat domus Achab: filia enim Achab erat uxor ejus: et fecit quod malum est in conspectu Domini.
19 Noluit autem Dominus disperdere Judam, propter David servum suum, sicut promiserat ei, ut daret illi lucernam, et filiis ejus cunctis diebus.
20 In diebus ejus recessit Edom ne esset sub Juda, et constituit sibi regem.
21 Venitque Joram Seira, et omnes currus cum eo: et surrexit nocte, percussitque Idumæos qui eum circumdederant, et principes curruum: populus autem fugit in tabernacula sua.
22 Recessit ergo Edom ne esset sub Juda, usque ad diem hanc. Tunc recessit et Lobna in tempore illo.
23 Reliqua autem sermonum Joram, et universa quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Juda?
24 Et dormivit Joram cum patribus suis, sepultusque est cum eis in civitate David, et regnavit Ochozias filius ejus pro eo.

25 Anno duodecimo Joram filii Achab regis Israël regnavit Ochozias filius Joram regis Judæ.
26 Viginti duorum annorum erat Ochozias cum regnare cœpisset, et uno anno regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Athalia filia Amri regis Israël.
27 Et ambulavit in viis domus Achab: et fecit quod malum est coram Domino, sicut domus Achab: gener enim domus Achab fuit.
28 Abiit quoque cum Joram filio Achab ad præliandum contra Hazaël regem Syriæ in Ramoth Galaad, et vulneraverunt Syri Joram.
29 Qui reversus est ut curaretur in Jezrahel, quia vulneraverant eum Syri in Ramoth præliantem contra Hazaël regem Syriæ. Porro Ochozias filius Joram rex Juda descendit invisere Joram filium Achab in Jezrahel, quia ægrotabat ibi.

1 καὶ Ελισαιε ἐλάλησεν πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα ἧς ἐζωπύρησεν τὸν υἱόν λέγων ἀνάστηθι καὶ δεῦρο σὺ καὶ ὁ οἶκός σου καὶ παροίκει οὗ ἐὰν παροικήσῃς ὅτι κέκληκεν κύριος λιμὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καί γε ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἑπτὰ ἔτη
2 καὶ ἀνέστη ἡ γυνὴ καὶ ἐποίησεν κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ελισαιε καὶ ἐπορεύθη αὐτὴ καὶ ὁ οἶκος αὐτῆς καὶ παρῴκει ἐν γῇ ἀλλοφύλων ἑπτὰ ἔτη
3 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ τέλος τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ἡ γυνὴ ἐκ γῆς ἀλλοφύλων εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἦλθεν βοῆσαι πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα περὶ τοῦ οἴκου ἑαυτῆς καὶ περὶ τῶν ἀγρῶν ἑαυτῆς
4 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐλάλει πρὸς Γιεζι τὸ παιδάριον Ελισαιε τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ λέγων διήγησαι δή μοι πάντα τὰ μεγάλα ἃ ἐποίησεν Ελισαιε
5 καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῦ ἐξηγουμένου τῷ βασιλεῖ ὡς ἐζωπύρησεν υἱὸν τεθνηκότα καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ γυνή ἧς ἐζωπύρησεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς Ελισαιε βοῶσα πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα περὶ τοῦ οἴκου ἑαυτῆς καὶ περὶ τῶν ἀγρῶν ἑαυτῆς καὶ εἶπεν Γιεζι κύριε βασιλεῦ αὕτη ἡ γυνή καὶ οὗτος ὁ υἱὸς αὐτῆς ὃν ἐζωπύρησεν Ελισαιε
6 καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ διηγήσατο αὐτῷ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ ὁ βασιλεὺς εὐνοῦχον ἕνα λέγων ἐπίστρεψον πάντα τὰ αὐτῆς καὶ πάντα τὰ γενήματα τοῦ ἀγροῦ αὐτῆς ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς κατέλιπεν τὴν γῆν ἕως τοῦ νῦν

7 καὶ ἦλθεν Ελισαιε εἰς Δαμασκόν καὶ υἱὸς Αδερ βασιλεὺς Συρίας ἠρρώστει καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες ἥκει ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἕως ὧδε
8 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Αζαηλ λαβὲ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου μαναα καὶ δεῦρο εἰς ἀπαντὴν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐπιζήτησον τὸν κύριον πα{R'} αὐτοῦ λέγων εἰ ζήσομαι ἐκ τῆς ἀρρωστίας μου ταύτης
9 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Αζαηλ εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβεν μαναα ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ ἀγαθὰ Δαμασκοῦ ἄρσιν τεσσαράκοντα καμήλων καὶ ἦλθεν καὶ ἔστη ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Ελισαιε ὁ υἱός σου υἱὸς Αδερ βασιλεὺς Συρίας ἀπέστειλέν με πρὸς σὲ λέγων εἰ ζήσομαι ἐκ τῆς ἀρρωστίας μου ταύτης
10 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε δεῦρο εἰπὸν αὐτῷ ζωῇ ζήσῃ καὶ ἔδειξέν μοι κύριος ὅτι θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ
11 καὶ παρέστη τῷ προσώπῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθηκεν ἕως αἰσχύνης καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ
12 καὶ εἶπεν Αζαηλ τί ὅτι ὁ κύριός μου κλαίει καὶ εἶπεν ὅτι οἶδα ὅσα ποιήσεις τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ κακά τὰ ὀχυρώματα αὐτῶν ἐξαποστελεῖς ἐν πυρὶ καὶ τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς αὐτῶν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἀποκτενεῖς καὶ τὰ νήπια αὐτῶν ἐνσείσεις καὶ τὰς ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσας αὐτῶν ἀναρρήξεις
13 καὶ εἶπεν Αζαηλ τίς ἐστιν ὁ δοῦλός σου ὁ κύων ὁ τεθνηκώς ὅτι ποιήσει τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε ἔδειξέν μοι κύριός σε βασιλεύοντα ἐπὶ Συρίαν
14 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀπὸ Ελισαιε καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς τὸν κύριον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τί εἶπέν σοι Ελισαιε καὶ εἶπεν εἶπέν μοι ζωῇ ζήσῃ
15 καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ ἐπαύριον καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸ μαχμα καὶ ἔβαψεν ἐν τῷ ὕδατι καὶ περιέβαλεν ἐπὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέθανεν καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Αζαηλ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ

16 ἐν ἔτει πέμπτῳ τῷ Ιωραμ υἱῷ Αχααβ βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωραμ υἱὸς Ιωσαφατ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα
17 υἱὸς τριάκοντα καὶ δύο ἐτῶν ἦν ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ ὀκτὼ ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
18 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ βασιλέων Ισραηλ καθὼς ἐποίησεν οἶκος Αχααβ ὅτι θυγάτηρ Αχααβ ἦν αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον κυρίου
19 καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν κύριος διαφθεῖραι τὸν Ιουδαν διὰ Δαυιδ τὸν δοῦλον αὐτοῦ καθὼς εἶπεν δοῦναι αὐτῷ λύχνον καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
20 ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἠθέτησεν Εδωμ ὑποκάτωθεν χειρὸς Ιουδα καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν ἐ{F'} ἑαυτοὺς βασιλέα

22 καὶ ἠθέτησεν Εδωμ ὑποκάτωθεν χειρὸς Ιουδα ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης τότε ἠθέτησεν Λοβενα ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ
