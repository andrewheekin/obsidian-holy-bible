# Second Book of Kings 4 (RSVCE)

### Elisha and the Widow’s Oil
1 Now the wife of one of the sons of the prophets cried to Eliʹsha, “Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant feared theLord, but the creditor has come to take my two children to be his slaves.”
2 And Eliʹsha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me; what have you in the house?” And she said, “Your maidservant has nothing in the house, except a jar of oil.”
3 Then he said, “Go outside, borrow vessels of all your neighbors, empty vessels and not too few.
4 Then go in, and shut the door upon yourself and your sons, and pour into all these vessels; and when one is full, set it aside.”
5 So she went from him and shut the door upon herself and her sons; and as she poured they brought the vessels to her.
6 When the vessels were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” And he said to her, “There is not another.” Then the oil stopped flowing.
7 She came and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debts, and you and your sons can live on the rest.”
### Elisha Raises the Shunammite’s Son
8 One day Eliʹsha went on to Shunem, where a wealthy woman lived, who urged him to eat some food. So whenever he passed that way, he would turn in there to eat food.
9 And she said to her husband, “Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who is continually passing our way.
10 Let us make a small roof chamber with walls, and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp, so that whenever he comes to us, he can go in there.”
11 One day he came there, and he turned into the chamber and rested there.
12 And he said to Gehaʹzi his servant, “Call this Shuʹnammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him.
13 And he said to him, “Say now to her, See, you have taken all this trouble for us; what is to be done for you? Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?” She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”
14 And he said, “What then is to be done for her?” Gehaʹzi answered, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.”
15 He said, “Call her.” And when he had called her, she stood in the doorway.
16 And he said, “At this season, when the time comes round, you shall embrace a son.” And she said, “No, my lord, O man of God; do not lie to your maidservant.”
17 But the woman conceived, and she bore a son about that time the following spring, as Eliʹsha had said to her.
18 When the child had grown, he went out one day to his father among the reapers.
19 And he said to his father, “Oh, my head, my head!” The father said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”
20 And when he had lifted him, and brought him to his mother, the child sat on her lap till noon, and then he died.
21 And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.
22 Then she called to her husband, and said, “Send me one of the servants and one of the asses, that I may quickly go to the man of God, and come back again.”
23 And he said, “Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath.” She said, “It will be well.”
24 Then she saddled the ass, and she said to her servant, “Urge the beast on; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.”
25 So she set out, and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her coming, he said to Gehaʹzi his servant, “Look, yonder is the Shuʹnammite;
26 run at once to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?” And she answered, “It is well.”
27 And when she came to the mountain to the man of God, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehaʹzi came to thrust her away. But the man of God said, “Let her alone, for she is in bitter distress; and theLordhas hidden it from me, and has not told me.”
28 Then she said, “Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?”
29 He said to Gehaʹzi, “Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet any one, do not salute him; and if any one salutes you, do not reply; and lay my staff upon the face of the child.”
30 Then the mother of the child said, “As theLordlives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So he arose and followed her.
31 Gehaʹzi went on ahead and laid the staff upon the face of the child, but there was no sound or sign of life. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, “The child has not awaked.”
32 When Eliʹsha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on his bed.
33 So he went in and shut the door upon the two of them, and prayed to theLord.
34 Then he went up and lay upon the child, putting his mouth upon his mouth, his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and as he stretched himself upon him, the flesh of the child became warm.
35 Then he got up again, and walked once to and fro in the house, and went up, and stretched himself upon him; the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
36 Then he summoned Gehaʹzi and said, “Call this Shuʹnammite.” So he called her. And when she came to him, he said, “Take up your son.”
37 She came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground; then she took up her son and went out.
### Elisha Purifies the Pot of Stew
38 And Eliʹsha came again to Gilgal when there was a famine in the land. And as the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he said to his servant, “Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.”
39 One of them went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds, and came and cut them up into the pot of pottage, not knowing what they were.
40 And they poured out for the men to eat. But while they were eating of the pottage, they cried out, “O man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it.
41 He said, “Then bring meal.” And he threw it into the pot, and said, “Pour out for the men, that they may eat.” And there was no harm in the pot.
### Elisha Feeds One Hundred Men
42 A man came from Baʹal-shalʹishah, bringing the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And Eliʹsha said, “Give to the men, that they may eat.”
43 But his servant said, “How am I to set this before a hundred men?” So he repeated, “Give them to the men, that they may eat, for thus says theLord, ‘They shall eat and have some left.’ ”
44 So he set it before them. And they ate, and had some left, according to the word of theLord.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Mulier autem quædam de uxoribus prophetarum clamabat ad Eliseum, dicens: Servus tuus vir meus mortuus est, et tu nosti quia servus tuus fuit timens Dominum: et ecce creditor venit ut tollat duos filios meos ad serviendum sibi.
2 Cui dixit Eliseus: Quid vis ut faciam tibi? dic mihi, quid habes in domo tua? At illa respondit: Non habeo ancilla tua quidquam in domo mea, nisi parum olei quo ungar.
3 Cui ait: Vade, pete mutuo ab omnibus vicinis tuis vasa vacua non pauca,
4 et ingredere, et claude ostium tuum cum intrinsecus fueris tu, et filii tui: et mitte inde in omnia vasa hæc, et cum plena fuerint, tolles.
5 Ivit itaque mulier, et clausit ostium super se, et super filios suos: illi offerebant vasa, et illa infundebat.
6 Cumque plena fuissent vasa, dixit ad filium suum: Affer mihi adhuc vas. Et ille respondit: Non habeo. Stetitque oleum.
7 Venit autem illa, et indicavit homini Dei. Et ille: Vade, inquit, vende oleum, et redde creditori tuo: tu autem, et filii tui vivite de reliquo.

8 Facta est autem quædam dies, et transibat Eliseus per Sunam: erat autem ibi mulier magna, quæ tenuit eum ut comederet panem: cumque frequenter inde transiret, divertebat ad eam ut comederet panem.
9 Quæ dixit ad virum suum: Animadverto quod vir Dei sanctus est iste, qui transit per nos frequenter.
10 Faciamus ergo ei cœnaculum parvum, et ponamus ei in eo lectulum, et mensam, et sellam, et candelabrum, ut cum venerit ad nos, maneat ibi.
11 Facta est ergo dies quædam, et veniens divertit in cœnaculum, et requievit ibi.
12 Dixitque ad Giezi puerum suum: Voca Sunamitidem istam. Qui cum vocasset eam, et illa stetisset coram eo,
13 dixit ad puerum suum: Loquere ad eam: Ecce, sedule in omnibus ministrasti nobis: quid vis ut faciam tibi? numquid habes negotium, et vis ut loquar regi, sive principi militiæ? Quæ respondit: In medio populi mei habito.
14 Et ait: Quid ergo vult ut faciam ei? Dixitque Giezi: Ne quæras: filium enim non habet, et vir ejus senex est.
15 Præcepit itaque ut vocaret eam: quæ cum vocata fuisset, et stetisset ante ostium,
16 dixit ad eam: In tempore isto, et in hac eadem hora, si vita comes fuerit, habebis in utero filium. At illa respondit: Noli quæso, domine mi vir Dei, noli mentiri ancillæ tuæ.
17 Et concepit mulier, et peperit filium in tempore, et in hora eadem, qua dixerat Eliseus.

18 Crevit autem puer: et cum esset quædam dies, et egressus isset ad patrem suum, ad messores,
19 ait patri suo: Caput meum doleo, caput meum doleo. At ille dixit puero: Tolle, et duc eum ad matrem suam.
20 Qui cum tulisset, et duxisset eum ad matrem suam, posuit eum illa super genua sua usque ad meridiem, et mortuus est.
21 Ascendit autem, et collocavit eum super lectulum hominis Dei, et clausit ostium: et egressa,
22 vocavit virum suum, et ait: Mitte mecum, obsecro, unum de pueris, et asinam, ut excurram usque ad hominem Dei, et revertar.
23 Qui ait illi: Quam ob causam vadis ad eum? hodie non sunt calendæ, neque sabbatum. Quæ respondit: Vadam.
24 Stravitque asinam, et præcepit puero: Mina, et propera: ne mihi moram facias in eundo: et hoc age quod præcipio tibi.

25 Profecta est igitur, et venit ad virum Dei in montem Carmeli: cumque vidisset eam vir Dei e contra, ait ad Giezi puerum suum: Ecce Sunamitis illa.
26 Vade ergo in occursum ejus, et dic ei: Recte ne agitur circa te, et circa virum tuum, et circa filium tuum? Quæ respondit: Recte.
27 Cumque venisset ad virum Dei in montem, apprehendit pedes ejus: et accessit Giezi ut amoveret eam. Et ait homo Dei: Dimitte illam: anima enim ejus in amaritudine est, et Dominus celavit a me, et non indicavit mihi.
28 Quæ dixit illi: Numquid petivi filium a domino meo? numquid non dixi tibi: Ne illudas me?
29 Et ille ait ad Giezi: Accinge lumbos tuos, et tolle baculum meum in manu tua, et vade. Si occurrerit tibi homo, non salutes eum: et si salutaverit te quispiam, non respondeas illi: et pones baculum meum super faciem pueri.
30 Porro mater pueri ait: Vivit Dominus, et vivit anima tua, non dimittam te. Surrexit ergo, et secutus est eam.

31 Giezi autem præcesserat ante eos, et posuerat baculum super faciem pueri, et non erat vox, neque sensus: reversusque est in occursum ejus, et nuntiavit ei, dicens: Non surrexit puer.
32 Ingressus est ergo Eliseus domum, et ecce puer mortuus jacebat in lectulo ejus:
33 ingressusque clausit ostium super se et super puerum, et oravit ad Dominum.
34 Et ascendit, et incubuit super puerum: posuitque os suum super os ejus, et oculos suos super oculos ejus, et manus suas super manus ejus: et incurvavit se super eum, et calefacta est caro pueri.
35 At ille reversus, deambulavit in domo, semel huc atque illuc: et ascendit, et incubuit super eum: et oscitavit puer septies, aperuitque oculos.
36 At ille vocavit Giezi, et dixit ei: Voca Sunamitidem hanc. Quæ vocata, ingressa est ad eum. Qui ait: Tolle filium tuum.
37 Venit illa, et corruit ad pedes ejus, et adoravit super terram: tulitque filium suum, et egressa est.
38 Et Eliseus reversus est in Galgala. Erat autem fames in terra, et filii prophetarum habitabant coram eo. Dixitque uni de pueris suis: Pone ollam grandem, et coque pulmentum filiis prophetarum.
39 Et egressus est unus in agrum ut colligeret herbas agrestes: invenitque quasi vitem silvestrem, et collegit ex ea colocynthidas agri, et implevit pallium suum, et reversus concidit in ollam pulmenti: nesciebat enim quid esset.
40 Infuderunt ergo sociis ut comederent: cumque gustassent de coctione, clamaverunt, dicentes: Mors in olla, vir Dei. Et non potuerunt comedere.
41 At ille: Afferte, inquit, farinam. Cumque tulissent, misit in ollam, et ait: Infunde turbæ, ut comedant. Et non fuit amplius quidquam amaritudinis in olla.

42 Vir autem quidam venit de Baalsalisa deferens viro Dei panes primitiarum, viginti panes hordeaceos, et frumentum novum in pera sua. At ille dixit: Da populo, ut comedat.
43 Responditque ei minister ejus: Quantum est hoc, ut apponam centum viris? Rursum ille ait: Da populo, ut comedat: hæc enim dicit Dominus: Comedent, et supererit.
44 Posuit itaque coram eis: qui comederunt, et superfuit juxta verbum Domini.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 4 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ γυνὴ μία ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῶν προφητῶν ἐβόα πρὸς Ελισαιε λέγουσα ὁ δοῦλός σου ὁ ἀνήρ μου ἀπέθανεν καὶ σὺ ἔγνως ὅτι δοῦλος ἦν φοβούμενος τὸν κύριον καὶ ὁ δανιστὴς ἦλθεν λαβεῖν τοὺς δύο υἱούς μου ἑαυτῷ εἰς δούλους
2 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε τί ποιήσω σοι ἀνάγγειλόν μοι τί ἐστίν σοι ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ἡ δὲ εἶπεν οὐκ ἔστιν τῇ δούλῃ σου οὐθὲν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ ὃ ἀλείψομαι ἔλαιον
3 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτήν δεῦρο αἴτησον σαυτῇ σκεύη ἔξωθεν παρὰ πάντων τῶν γειτόνων σου σκεύη κενά μὴ ὀλιγώσῃς
4 καὶ εἰσελεύσῃ καὶ ἀποκλείσεις τὴν θύραν κατὰ σοῦ καὶ κατὰ τῶν υἱῶν σου καὶ ἀποχεεῖς εἰς τὰ σκεύη ταῦτα καὶ τὸ πληρωθὲν ἀρεῖς
5 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν πα{R'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐποίησεν οὕτως καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν τὴν θύραν κα{T'} αὐτῆς καὶ κατὰ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτῆς αὐτοὶ προσήγγιζον πρὸς αὐτήν καὶ αὐτὴ ἐπέχεεν
6 ἕως ἐπλήσθησαν τὰ σκεύη καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῆς ἐγγίσατε ἔτι πρός με σκεῦος καὶ εἶπον αὐτῇ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι σκεῦος καὶ ἔστη τὸ ἔλαιον
7 καὶ ἦλθεν καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε δεῦρο καὶ ἀπόδου τὸ ἔλαιον καὶ ἀποτείσεις τοὺς τόκους σου καὶ σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου ζήσεσθε ἐν τῷ ἐπιλοίπῳ ἐλαίῳ

8 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡμέρα καὶ διέβη Ελισαιε εἰς Σουμαν καὶ ἐκεῖ γυνὴ μεγάλη καὶ ἐκράτησεν αὐτὸν φαγεῖν ἄρτον καὶ ἐγένετο ἀ{F'} ἱκανοῦ τοῦ εἰσπορεύεσθαι αὐτὸν ἐξέκλινεν τοῦ ἐκεῖ φαγεῖν
9 καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς ἰδοὺ δὴ ἔγνων ὅτι ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἅγιος οὗτος διαπορεύεται ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς διὰ παντός
10 ποιήσωμεν δὴ αὐτῷ ὑπερῷον τόπον μικρὸν καὶ θῶμεν αὐτῷ ἐκεῖ κλίνην καὶ τράπεζαν καὶ δίφρον καὶ λυχνίαν καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐκκλινεῖ ἐκεῖ
11 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡμέρα καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐξέκλινεν εἰς τὸ ὑπερῷον καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐκεῖ
12 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Γιεζι τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ κάλεσόν μοι τὴν Σωμανῖτιν ταύτην καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτήν καὶ ἔστη ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ εἰπὸν δὴ πρὸς αὐτήν ἰδοὺ ἐξέστησας ἡμῖν πᾶσαν τὴν ἔκστασιν ταύτην τί δεῖ ποιῆσαί σοι εἰ ἔστιν λόγος σοι πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἢ πρὸς τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς δυνάμεως ἡ δὲ εἶπεν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ μου ἐγώ εἰμι οἰκῶ
14 καὶ εἶπεν τί δεῖ ποιῆσαι αὐτῇ καὶ εἶπεν Γιεζι τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ καὶ μάλα υἱὸς οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῇ καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς πρεσβύτης
15 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτήν καὶ ἔστη παρὰ τὴν θύραν
16 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε πρὸς αὐτήν εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον ὡς ἡ ὥρα ζῶσα σὺ περιειληφυῖα υἱόν ἡ δὲ εἶπεν μή κύριέ μου μὴ διαψεύσῃ τὴν δούλην σου
17 καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔλαβεν ἡ γυνὴ καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον ὡς ἡ ὥρα ζῶσα ὡς ἐλάλησεν πρὸς αὐτὴν Ελισαιε

18 καὶ ἡδρύνθη τὸ παιδάριον καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἐξῆλθεν τὸ παιδάριον πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ πρὸς τοὺς θερίζοντας
19 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ τὴν κεφαλήν μου τὴν κεφαλήν μου καὶ εἶπεν τῷ παιδαρίῳ ἆρον αὐτὸν πρὸς τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ
20 καὶ ἦρεν αὐτὸν πρὸς τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐπὶ τῶν γονάτων αὐτῆς ἕως μεσημβρίας καὶ ἀπέθανεν
21 καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐκοίμισεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν κα{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν
22 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς καὶ εἶπεν ἀπόστειλον δή μοι ἓν τῶν παιδαρίων καὶ μίαν τῶν ὄνων καὶ δραμοῦμαι ἕως τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐπιστρέψω
23 καὶ εἶπεν τί ὅτι σὺ πορεύῃ πρὸς αὐτὸν σήμερον οὐ νεομηνία οὐδὲ σάββατον ἡ δὲ εἶπεν εἰρήνη
24 καὶ ἐπέσαξεν τὴν ὄνον καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον αὐτῆς ἄγε πορεύου μὴ ἐπίσχῃς μοι τοῦ ἐπιβῆναι ὅτι ἐὰν εἴπω σοι

25 δεῦρο καὶ πορεύσῃ καὶ ἐλεύσῃ πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦ θεοῦ εἰς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Καρμήλιον καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδεν Ελισαιε ἐρχομένην αὐτήν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Γιεζι τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ ἰδοὺ δὴ ἡ Σωμανῖτις ἐκείνη
26 νῦν δράμε εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτῆς καὶ ἐρεῖς εἰ εἰρήνη σοι εἰ εἰρήνη τῷ ἀνδρί σου εἰ εἰρήνη τῷ παιδαρίῳ ἡ δὲ εἶπεν Εἰρήνη
27 καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς Ελισαιε εἰς τὸ ὄρος καὶ ἐπελάβετο τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἤγγισεν Γιεζι ἀπώσασθαι αὐτήν καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε ἄφες αὐτήν ὅτι ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῆς κατώδυνος αὐτῇ καὶ κύριος ἀπέκρυψεν ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἀνήγγειλέν μοι
28 ἡ δὲ εἶπεν μὴ ᾐτησάμην υἱὸν παρὰ τοῦ κυρίου μου οὐκ εἶπα οὐ πλανήσεις με{T'} ἐμοῦ
29 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε τῷ Γιεζι ζῶσαι τὴν ὀσφύν σου καὶ λαβὲ τὴν βακτηρίαν μου ἐν τῇ χειρί σου καὶ δεῦρο ὅτι ἐὰν εὕρῃς ἄνδρα οὐκ εὐλογήσεις αὐτόν καὶ ἐὰν εὐλογήσῃ σε ἀνήρ οὐκ ἀποκριθήσῃ αὐτῷ καὶ ἐπιθήσεις τὴν βακτηρίαν μου ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ παιδαρίου
30 καὶ εἶπεν ἡ μήτηρ τοῦ παιδαρίου ζῇ κύριος καὶ ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου εἰ ἐγκαταλείψω σε καὶ ἀνέστη Ελισαιε καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω αὐτῆς

31 καὶ Γιεζι διῆλθεν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῆς καὶ ἐπέθηκεν τὴν βακτηρίαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ παιδαρίου καὶ οὐκ ἦν φωνὴ καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀκρόασις καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ λέγων οὐκ ἠγέρθη τὸ παιδάριον
32 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ελισαιε εἰς τὸν οἶκον καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ παιδάριον τεθνηκὸς κεκοιμισμένον ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην αὐτοῦ
33 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ελισαιε εἰς τὸν οἶκον καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν τὴν θύραν κατὰ τῶν δύο ἑαυτῶν καὶ προσηύξατο πρὸς κύριον
34 καὶ ἀνέβη καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐπὶ τὸ παιδάριον καὶ ἔθηκεν τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ καὶ διέκαμψεν ἐ{P'} αὐτόν καὶ διεθερμάνθη ἡ σὰρξ τοῦ παιδαρίου
35 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν καὶ ἀνέβη καὶ συνέκαμψεν ἐπὶ τὸ παιδάριον ἕως ἑπτάκις καὶ ἤνοιξεν τὸ παιδάριον τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ
36 καὶ ἐξεβόησεν Ελισαιε πρὸς Γιεζι καὶ εἶπεν κάλεσον τὴν Σωμανῖτιν ταύτην καὶ ἐκάλεσεν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε λαβὲ τὸν υἱόν σου
37 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἡ γυνὴ καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ καὶ προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς καὶ ἐξῆλθεν
38 καὶ Ελισαιε ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς Γαλγαλα καὶ ὁ λιμὸς ἐν τῇ γῇ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν ἐκάθηντο ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὐτοῦ ἐπίστησον τὸν λέβητα τὸν μέγαν καὶ ἕψε ἕψεμα τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν προφητῶν
39 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἷς εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν συλλέξαι αριωθ καὶ εὗρεν ἄμπελον ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ καὶ συνέλεξεν ἀ{P'} αὐτῆς τολύπην ἀγρίαν πλῆρες τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐνέβαλεν εἰς τὸν λέβητα τοῦ ἑψέματος ὅτι οὐκ ἔγνωσαν
40 καὶ ἐνέχει τοῖς ἀνδράσιν φαγεῖν καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐσθίειν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τοῦ ἑψήματος καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνεβόησαν καὶ εἶπον θάνατος ἐν τῷ λέβητι ἄνθρωπε τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο φαγεῖν
41 καὶ εἶπεν λάβετε ἄλευρον καὶ ἐμβάλετε εἰς τὸν λέβητα καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε πρὸς Γιεζι τὸ παιδάριον ἔγχει τῷ λαῷ καὶ ἐσθιέτωσαν καὶ οὐκ ἐγενήθη ἔτι ἐκεῖ ῥῆμα πονηρὸν ἐν τῷ λέβητι

42 καὶ ἀνὴρ διῆλθεν ἐκ Βαιθσαρισα καὶ ἤνεγκεν πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦ θεοῦ πρωτογενημάτων εἴκοσι ἄρτους κριθίνους καὶ παλάθας καὶ εἶπεν δότε τῷ λαῷ καὶ ἐσθιέτωσαν
43 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λειτουργὸς αὐτοῦ τί δῶ τοῦτο ἐνώπιον ἑκατὸν ἀνδρῶν καὶ εἶπεν δὸς τῷ λαῷ καὶ ἐσθιέτωσαν ὅτι τάδε λέγει κύριος φάγονται καὶ καταλείψουσιν
44 καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ κατέλιπον κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου
