# Second Book of Kings 11 (RSVCE)

### Athaliah Reigns over Judah
1 Now when Athaliʹah the mother of Ahaziʹah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family.
2 But Jehoshʹeba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziʹah, took Joʹash the son of Ahaziʹah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were about to be slain, and she put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. Thus she hid him from Athaliʹah, so that he was not slain;
3 and he remained with her six years, hid in the house of theLord, while Athaliʹah reigned over the land.
### Jehoiada Anoints the Child Joash
4 But in the seventh year Jehoiʹada sent and brought the captains of the Carites and of the guards, and had them come to him in the house of theLord; and he made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of theLord, and he showed them the king’s son.
5 And he commanded them, “This is the thing that you shall do: one third of you, those who come off duty on the sabbath and guard the king’s house
6 (another third being at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guards), shall guard the palace;
7 and the two divisions of you, which come on duty in force on the sabbath and guard the house of theLord,
8 shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand; and whoever approaches the ranks is to be slain. Be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in.”
9 The captains did according to all that Jehoiʹada the priest commanded, and each brought his men who were to go off duty on the sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiʹada the priest.
10 And the priest delivered to the captains the spears and shields that had been King David’s, which were in the house of theLord;
11 and the guards stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house.
12 Then he brought out the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they proclaimed him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!”
### Death of Athaliah
13 When Athaliʹah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she went into the house of theLordto the people;
14 and when she looked, there was the king standing by the pillar, according to the custom, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. And Athaliʹah rent her clothes, and cried, “Treason! Treason!”
15 Then Jehoiʹada the priest commanded the captains who were set over the army, “Bring her out between the ranks; and slay with the sword any one who follows her.” For the priest said, “Let her not be slain in the house of theLord.”
16 So they laid hands on her; and she went through the horses’ entrance to the king’s house, and there she was slain.
17 And Jehoiʹada made a covenant between theLordand the king and people, that they should be theLord’s people; and also between the king and the people.
18 Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baʹal, and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they slew Mattan the priest of Baʹal before the altars. And the priest posted watchmen over the house of theLord.
19 And he took the captains, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of theLord, marching through the gate of the guards to the king’s house. And he took his seat on the throne of the kings.
20 So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet after Athaliʹah had been slain with the sword at the king’s house.
21 Jehoʹash was seven years old when he began to reign.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 11 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Athalia vero mater Ochoziæ, videns mortuum filium suum, surrexit, et interfecit omne semen regium.
2 Tollens autem Josaba filia regis Joram, soror Ochoziæ, Joas filium Ochoziæ, furata est eum de medio filiorum regis qui interficiebantur, et nutricem ejus de triclinio: et abscondit eum a facie Athaliæ ut non interficeretur.
3 Eratque cum ea sex annis clam in domo Domini: porro Athalia regnavit super terram.
4 Anno autem septimo misit Jojada, et assumens centuriones et milites, introduxit ad se in templum Domini, pepigitque cum eis fœdus: et adjurans eos in domo Domini, ostendit eis filium regis:
5 et præcepit illis, dicens: Iste est sermo, quem facere debetis:
6 tertia pars vestrum introëat sabbato, et observet excubias domus regis. Tertia autem pars sit ad portam Sur, et tertia pars sit ad portam quæ est post habitaculum scutariorum: et custodietis excubias domus Messa.
7 Duæ vero partes e vobis, omnes egredientes sabbato, custodiant excubias domus Domini circa regem.
8 Et vallabitis eum, habentes arma in manibus vestris: si quis autem ingressus fuerit septum templi, interficiatur: eritisque cum rege introëunte et egrediente.

9 Et fecerunt centuriones juxta omnia quæ præceperat eis Jojada sacerdos: et assumentes singuli viros suos qui ingrediebantur sabbatum, cum his qui egrediebantur sabbato, venerunt ad Jojadam sacerdotem.
10 Qui dedit eis hastas et arma regis David, quæ erant in domo Domini.
11 Et steterunt singuli habentes arma in manu sua, a parte templi dextera usque ad partem sinistram altaris et ædis, circum regem.
12 Produxitque filium regis, et posuit super eum diadema et testimonium: feceruntque eum regem, et unxerunt: et plaudentes manu, dixerunt: Vivat rex.
13 Audivit autem Athalia vocem populi currentis: et ingressa ad turbas in templum Domini,
14 vidit regem stantem super tribunal juxta morem, et cantores, et tubas prope eum, omnemque populum terræ lætantem, et canentem tubis: et scidit vestimenta sua, clamavitque: Conjuratio, conjuratio.
15 Præcepit autem Jojada centurionibus qui erant super exercitum, et ait eis: Educite eam extra septa templi, et quicumque eam secutus fuerit, feriatur gladio. Dixerat enim sacerdos: Non occidatur in templo Domini.
16 Imposueruntque ei manus, et impegerunt eam per viam introitus equorum, juxta palatium, et interfecta est ibi.

17 Pepigit ergo Jojada fœdus inter Dominum, et inter regem, et inter populum, ut esset populus Domini: et inter regem et populum.
18 Ingressusque est omnis populus terræ templum Baal, et destruxerunt aras ejus, et imagines contriverunt valide: Mathan quoque sacerdotem Baal occiderunt coram altari. Et posuit sacerdos custodias in domo Domini.
19 Tulitque centuriones, et Cerethi et Phelethi legiones, et omnem populum terræ, deduxeruntque regem de domo Domini: et venerunt per viam portæ scutariorum in palatium, et sedit super thronum regum.
20 Lætatusque est omnis populus terræ, et civitas conquievit: Athalia autem occisa est gladio in domo regis.
21 Septemque annorum erat Joas, cum regnare cœpisset.

1 καὶ Γοθολια ἡ μήτηρ Οχοζιου εἶδεν ὅτι ἀπέθανον οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῆς καὶ ἀπώλεσεν πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα τῆς βασιλείας
2 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ιωσαβεε θυγάτηρ τοῦ βασιλέως Ιωραμ ἀδελφὴ Οχοζιου τὸν Ιωας υἱὸν ἀδελφοῦ αὐτῆς καὶ ἔκλεψεν αὐτὸν ἐκ μέσου τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν θανατουμένων αὐτὸν καὶ τὴν τροφὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ταμιείῳ τῶν κλινῶν καὶ ἔκρυψεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ προσώπου Γοθολιας καὶ οὐκ ἐθανατώθη
3 καὶ ἦν με{T'} αὐτῆς ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου κρυβόμενος ἓξ ἔτη καὶ Γοθολια βασιλεύουσα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
4 καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ ἑβδόμῳ ἀπέστειλεν Ιωδαε ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ ἔλαβεν τοὺς ἑκατοντάρχους τὸν Χορρι καὶ τὸν Ρασιμ καὶ ἀπήγαγεν αὐτοὺς πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς οἶκον κυρίου καὶ διέθετο αὐτοῖς διαθήκην κυρίου καὶ ὥρκισεν αὐτοὺς ἐνώπιον κυρίου καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς Ιωδαε τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ βασιλέως
5 καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς λέγων οὗτος ὁ λόγος ὃν ποιήσετε τὸ τρίτον ἐξ ὑμῶν εἰσελθέτω τὸ σάββατον καὶ φυλάξετε φυλακὴν οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν τῷ πυλῶνι
6 καὶ τὸ τρίτον ἐν τῇ πύλῃ τῶν ὁδῶν καὶ τὸ τρίτον τῆς πύλης ὀπίσω τῶν παρατρεχόντων καὶ φυλάξετε τὴν φυλακὴν τοῦ οἴκου
7 καὶ δύο χεῖρες ἐν ὑμῖν πᾶς ὁ ἐκπορευόμενος τὸ σάββατον καὶ φυλάξουσιν τὴν φυλακὴν οἴκου κυρίου πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα
8 καὶ κυκλώσατε ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα κύκλῳ ἀνὴρ καὶ τὸ σκεῦος αὐτοῦ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος εἰς τὰ σαδηρωθ ἀποθανεῖται καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν τῷ ἐκπορεύεσθαι αὐτὸν καὶ ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι αὐτόν

9 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ ἑκατόνταρχοι πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο Ιωδαε ὁ συνετός καὶ ἔλαβεν ἀνὴρ τοὺς ἄνδρας αὐτοῦ τοὺς εἰσπορευομένους τὸ σάββατον μετὰ τῶν ἐκπορευομένων τὸ σάββατον καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς Ιωδαε τὸν ἱερέα
10 καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ ἱερεὺς τοῖς ἑκατοντάρχαις τοὺς σειρομάστας καὶ τοὺς τρισσοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως Δαυιδ τοὺς ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου
11 καὶ ἔστησαν οἱ παρατρέχοντες ἀνὴρ καὶ τὸ σκεῦος αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς ὠμίας τοῦ οἴκου τῆς δεξιᾶς ἕως τῆς ὠμίας τοῦ οἴκου τῆς εὐωνύμου τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ τοῦ οἴκου ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα κύκλῳ
12 καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν τὸ νεζερ καὶ τὸ μαρτύριον καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἔχρισεν αὐτόν καὶ ἐκρότησαν τῇ χειρὶ καὶ εἶπαν ζήτω ὁ βασιλεύς
13 καὶ ἤκουσεν Γοθολια τὴν φωνὴν τῶν τρεχόντων τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς τὸν λαὸν εἰς οἶκον κυρίου
14 καὶ εἶδεν καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ βασιλεὺς εἱστήκει ἐπὶ τοῦ στύλου κατὰ τὸ κρίμα καὶ οἱ ᾠδοὶ καὶ αἱ σάλπιγγες πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς χαίρων καὶ σαλπίζων ἐν σάλπιγξιν καὶ διέρρηξεν Γοθολια τὰ ἱμάτια ἑαυτῆς καὶ ἐβόησεν σύνδεσμος σύνδεσμος
15 καὶ ἐνετείλατο Ιωδαε ὁ ἱερεὺς τοῖς ἑκατοντάρχαις τοῖς ἐπισκόποις τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς ἐξαγάγετε αὐτὴν ἔσωθεν τῶν σαδηρωθ καὶ ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος ὀπίσω αὐτῆς θανάτῳ θανατωθήσεται ῥομφαίᾳ ὅτι εἶπεν ὁ ἱερεύς καὶ μὴ ἀποθάνῃ ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου
16 καὶ ἐπέθηκαν αὐτῇ χεῖρας καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁδὸν εἰσόδου τῶν ἵππων οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ

17 καὶ διέθετο Ιωδαε διαθήκην ἀνὰ μέσον κυρίου καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ εἶναι εἰς λαὸν τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ λαοῦ
18 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς εἰς οἶκον τοῦ Βααλ καὶ κατέσπασαν αὐτὸν καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς εἰκόνας αὐτοῦ συνέτριψαν ἀγαθῶς καὶ τὸν Ματθαν τὸν ἱερέα τοῦ Βααλ ἀπέκτειναν κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν θυσιαστηρίων καὶ ἔθηκεν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπισκόπους εἰς τὸν οἶκον κυρίου
19 καὶ ἔλαβεν τοὺς ἑκατοντάρχους καὶ τὸν Χορρι καὶ τὸν Ρασιμ καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς καὶ κατήγαγον τὸν βασιλέα ἐξ οἴκου κυρίου καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁδὸν πύλης τῶν παρατρεχόντων οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐκάθισαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου τῶν βασιλέων
20 καὶ ἐχάρη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς καὶ ἡ πόλις ἡσύχασεν καὶ τὴν Γοθολιαν ἐθανάτωσαν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως
21 υἱὸς ἐτῶν ἑπτὰ Ιωας ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν
