# Second Book of Kings 21 (RSVCE)

### Manasseh Reigns over Judah
1 Manasʹseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephʹzibah.
2 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom theLorddrove out before the people of Israel.
3 For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiʹah his father had destroyed; and he erected altars for Baʹal, and made an Asheʹrah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
4 And he built altars in the house of theLord, of which theLordhad said, “In Jerusalem will I put my name.”
5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of theLord.
6 And he burned his son as an offering, and practiced soothsaying and augury, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. He did much evil in the sight of theLord, provoking him to anger.
7 And the graven image of Asheʹrah that he had made he set in the house of which theLordsaid to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever;
8 and I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave to their fathers, if only they will be careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.”
9 But they did not listen, and Manasʹseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations had done whom theLorddestroyed before the people of Israel.
10 And theLordsaid by his servants the prophets,
11 “Because Manasʹseh king of Judah has committed these abominations, and has done things more wicked than all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols;
12 therefore thus says theLord, the God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing upon Jerusalem and Judah such evil that the ears of every one who hears of it will tingle.
13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samarʹia, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
14 And I will cast off the remnant of my heritage, and give them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies,
15 because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.”
16 Moreover Manasʹseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides the sin which he made Judah to sin so that they did what was evil in the sight of theLord.
17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasʹseh, and all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
18 And Manasʹseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
### Amon Reigns over Judah
19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshulʹlemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
20 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord, as Manasʹseh his father had done.
21 He walked in all the way in which his father walked, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them;
22 he forsook theLord, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of theLord.
23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and killed the king in his house.
24 But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiʹah his son king in his stead.
25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
26 And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza; and Josiʹah his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 21 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Duodecim annorum erat Manasses cum regnare cœpisset, et quinquaginta quinque annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Haphsiba.
2 Fecitque malum in conspectu Domini, juxta idola gentium quas delevit Dominus a facie filiorum Israël.
3 Conversusque est, et ædificavit excelsa quæ dissipaverat Ezechias pater ejus: et erexit aras Baal, et fecit lucos sicut fecerat Achab rex Israël, et adoravit omnem militiam cæli, et coluit eam.
4 Exstruxitque aras in domo Domini, de qua dixit Dominus: In Jerusalem ponam nomen meum.
5 Et exstruxit altaria universæ militiæ cæli in duobus atriis templi Domini.
6 Et traduxit filium suum per ignem: et ariolatus est, et observavit auguria, et fecit pythones, et aruspices multiplicavit, ut faceret malum coram Domino, et irritaret eum.
7 Posuit quoque idolum luci quem fecerat, in templo Domini, super quod locutus est Dominus ad David, et ad Salomonem filium ejus: In templo hoc, et in Jerusalem quam elegi de cunctis tribubus Israël, ponam nomen meum in sempiternum.
8 Et ultra non faciam commoveri pedem Israël de terra quam dedi patribus eorum: si tamen custodierint opere omnia quæ præcepi eis, et universam legem quam mandavit eis servus meus Moyses.
9 Illi vero non audierunt: sed seducti sunt a Manasse, ut facerent malum super gentes quas contrivit Dominus a facie filiorum Israël.

10 Locutusque est Dominus in manu servorum suorum prophetarum, dicens:
11 Quia fecit Manasses rex Juda abominationes istas pessimas, super omnia quæ fecerunt Amorrhæi ante eum, et peccare fecit etiam Judam in immunditiis suis:
12 propterea hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Ecce ego inducam mala super Jerusalem et Judam, ut quicumque audierit, tinniant ambæ aures ejus.
13 Et extendam super Jerusalem funiculum Samariæ, et pondus domus Achab: et delebo Jerusalem, sicut deleri solent tabulæ: et delens vertam, et ducam crebrius stylum super faciem ejus.
14 Dimittam vero reliquias hæreditatis meæ, et tradam eas in manus inimicorum ejus, eruntque in vastitatem, et in rapinam cunctis adversariis suis:
15 eo quod fecerint malum coram me, et perseveraverint irritantes me, ex die qua egressi sunt patres eorum ex Ægypto usque ad hanc diem.

16 Insuper et sanguinem innoxium fudit Manasses multum nimis, donec impleret Jerusalem usque ad os: absque peccatis suis quibus peccare fecit Judam, ut faceret malum coram Domino.
17 Reliqua autem sermonum Manasse, ut universa quæ fecit, et peccatum ejus quod peccavit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Juda?
18 Dormivitque Manasses cum patribus suis, et sepultus est in horto domus suæ, in horto Oza: et regnavit Amon filius ejus pro eo.

19 Viginti duorum annorum erat Amon cum regnare cœpisset: duobus quoque annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Messalemeth filia Harus de Jeteba.
20 Fecitque malum in conspectu Domini, sicut fecerat Manasses pater ejus.
21 Et ambulavit in omni via per quam ambulaverat pater ejus, servivitque immunditiis quibus servierat pater ejus, et adoravit eas:
22 et dereliquit Dominum Deum patrum suorum, et non ambulavit in via Domini.
23 Tetenderuntque ei insidias servi sui, et interfecerunt regem in domo sua.
24 Percussit autem populus terræ omnes qui conjuraverant contra regem Amon, et constituerunt sibi regem Josiam filium ejus pro eo.
25 Reliqua autem sermonum Amon quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Juda?
26 Sepelieruntque eum in sepulchro suo, in horto Oza: et regnavit Josias filius ejus pro eo.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 21 (Septuagint)

1 υἱὸς δώδεκα ἐτῶν Μανασσης ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ πεντήκοντα καὶ πέντε ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Οψιβα
2 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου κατὰ τὰ βδελύγματα τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν ἐξῆρεν κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ
3 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν τὰ ὑψηλά ἃ κατέσπασεν Εζεκιας ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέστησεν θυσιαστήριον τῇ Βααλ καὶ ἐποίησεν ἄλση καθὼς ἐποίησεν Αχααβ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ προσεκύνησεν πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἐδούλευσεν αὐτοῖς
4 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν θυσιαστήριον ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου ὡς εἶπεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ θήσω τὸ ὄνομά μου
5 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν θυσιαστήριον πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐν ταῖς δυσὶν αὐλαῖς οἴκου κυρίου
6 καὶ διῆγεν τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν πυρὶ καὶ ἐκληδονίζετο καὶ οἰωνίζετο καὶ ἐποίησεν θελητὴν καὶ γνώστας ἐπλήθυνεν τοῦ ποιεῖν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου παροργίσαι αὐτόν
7 καὶ ἔθηκεν τὸ γλυπτὸν τοῦ ἄλσους ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ᾧ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Δαυιδ καὶ πρὸς Σαλωμων τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ καὶ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ᾗ ἐξελεξάμην ἐκ πασῶν φυλῶν Ισραηλ καὶ θήσω τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
8 καὶ οὐ προσθήσω τοῦ σαλεῦσαι τὸν πόδα Ισραηλ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἧς ἔδωκα τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν οἵτινες φυλάξουσιν πάντα ὅσα ἐνετειλάμην κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ἐντολήν ἣν ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς ὁ δοῦλός μου Μωυσῆς
9 καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν καὶ ἐπλάνησεν αὐτοὺς Μανασσης τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου ὑπὲρ τὰ ἔθνη ἃ ἠφάνισεν κύριος ἐκ προσώπου υἱῶν Ισραηλ

10 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος ἐν χειρὶ δούλων αὐτοῦ τῶν προφητῶν λέγων
11 ἀν{Q'} ὧν ὅσα ἐποίησεν Μανασσης ὁ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα τὰ βδελύγματα ταῦτα τὰ πονηρὰ ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν ἐποίησεν ὁ Αμορραῖος ὁ ἔμπροσθεν καὶ ἐξήμαρτεν καί γε Ιουδα ἐν τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν
12 οὐχ οὕτως τάδε λέγει κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ φέρω κακὰ ἐπὶ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐπὶ Ιουδα ὥστε παντὸς ἀκούοντος ἠχήσει ἀμφότερα τὰ ὦτα αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ ἐκτενῶ ἐπὶ Ιερουσαλημ τὸ μέτρον Σαμαρείας καὶ τὸ στάθμιον οἴκου Αχααβ καὶ ἀπαλείψω τὴν Ιερουσαλημ καθὼς ἀπαλείφεται ὁ ἀλάβαστρος ἀπαλειφόμενος καὶ καταστρέφεται ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ ἀπώσομαι τὸ ὑπόλειμμα τῆς κληρονομίας μου καὶ παραδώσω αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔσονται εἰς διαρπαγὴν καὶ εἰς προνομὴν πᾶσιν τοῖς ἐχθροῖς αὐτῶν
15 ἀν{Q'} ὧν ὅσα ἐποίησαν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου καὶ ἦσαν παροργίζοντές με ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἐξήγαγον τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης

16 καί γε αἷμα ἀθῷον ἐξέχεεν Μανασσης πολὺ σφόδρα ἕως οὗ ἔπλησεν τὴν Ιερουσαλημ στόμα εἰς στόμα πλὴν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτοῦ ὧν ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ιουδαν τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου
17 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Μανασση καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν καὶ ἡ ἁμαρτία αὐτοῦ ἣν ἥμαρτεν οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ιουδα
18 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Μανασσης μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν τῷ κήπῳ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ ἐν κήπῳ Οζα καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Αμων υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ

19 υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ δύο ἐτῶν Αμων ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ δύο ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Μεσολλαμ θυγάτηρ Αρους ἐξ Ιετεβα
20 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου καθὼς ἐποίησεν Μανασσης ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ
21 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν πάσῃ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἐπορεύθη ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐλάτρευσεν τοῖς εἰδώλοις οἷς ἐλάτρευσεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτοῖς
22 καὶ ἐγκατέλιπεν τὸν κύριον θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ κυρίου
23 καὶ συνεστράφησαν οἱ παῖδες Αμων πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ ἐθανάτωσαν τὸν βασιλέα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ
24 καὶ ἐπάταξεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς πάντας τοὺς συστραφέντας ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Αμων καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τὸν Ιωσιαν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
25 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Αμων ὅσα ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ιουδα
26 καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ κήπῳ Οζα καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωσιας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
