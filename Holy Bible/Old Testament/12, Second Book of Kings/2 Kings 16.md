# Second Book of Kings 16 (RSVCE)

### Ahaz Reigns over Judah
1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliʹah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to reign.
2 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the eyes of theLordhis God, as his father David had done,
3 but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. He even burned his son as an offering, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom theLorddrove out before the people of Israel.
4 And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliʹah, king of Israel, came up to wage war on Jerusalem, and they besieged Ahaz but could not conquer him.
6 At that time the king of Edom recovered Elath for Edom, and drove the men of Judah from Elath; and the Eʹdomites came to Elath, where they dwell to this day.
7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tigʹlath-pileʹser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up, and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are attacking me.”
8 Ahaz also took the silver and gold that was found in the house of theLordand in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent a present to the king of Assyria.
9 And the king of Assyria hearkened to him; the king of Assyria marched up against Damascus, and took it, carrying its people captive to Kir, and he killed Rezin.
10 When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tigʹlath-pileʹser king of Assyria, he saw the altar that was at Damascus. And King Ahaz sent to Uriʹah the priest a model of the altar, and its pattern, exact in all its details.
11 And Uriʹah the priest built the altar; in accordance with all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Uriʹah the priest made it, before King Ahaz arrived from Damascus.
12 And when the king came from Damascus, the king viewed the altar. Then the king drew near to the altar, and went up on it,
13 and burned his burnt offering and his cereal offering, and poured his drink offering, and threw the blood of his peace offerings upon the altar.
14 And the bronze altar which was before theLordhe removed from the front of the house, from the place between his altar and the house of theLord, and put it on the north side of his altar.
15 And King Ahaz commanded Uriʹah the priest, saying, “Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening cereal offering, and the king’s burnt offering, and his cereal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their cereal offering, and their drink offering; and throw upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.”
16 Uriʹah the priest did all this, as King Ahaz commanded.
17 And King Ahaz cut off the frames of the stands, and removed the laver from them, and he took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pediment of stone.
18 And the covered way for the sabbath which had been built inside the palace, and the outer entrance for the king he removed from the house of theLord, because of the king of Assyria.
19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
20 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Hezekiʹah his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 16 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno decimoseptimo Phacee filii Romeliæ, regnavit Achaz filius Joatham regis Juda.
2 Viginti annorum erat Achaz cum regnare cœpisset, et sedecim annis regnavit in Jerusalem. Non fecit quod erat placitum in conspectu Domini Dei sui sicut David pater ejus,
3 sed ambulavit in via regum Israël: insuper et filium suum consecravit, transferens per ignem secundum idola gentium, quæ dissipavit Dominus coram filiis Israël.
4 Immolabat quoque victimas, et adolebat incensum in excelsis, et in collibus, et sub omni ligno frondoso.

5 Tunc ascendit Rasin rex Syriæ, et Phacee filius Romeliæ rex Israël, in Jerusalem ad præliandum: cumque obsiderent Achaz, non valuerunt superare eum.
6 In tempore illo restituit Rasin rex Syriæ, Ailam Syriæ, et ejecit Judæos de Aila: et Idumæi venerunt in Ailam, et habitaverunt ibi usque in diem hanc.
7 Misit autem Achaz nuntios ad Theglathphalasar regem Assyriorum, dicens: Servus tuus, et filius tuus ego sum: ascende, et salvum me fac de manu regis Syriæ, et de manu regis Israël, qui consurrexerunt adversum me.
8 Et cum collegisset argentum et aurum quod inveniri potuit in domo Domini et in thesauris regis, misit regi Assyriorum munera.
9 Qui et acquievit voluntati ejus: ascendit enim rex Assyriorum in Damascum, et vastavit eam, et transtulit habitatores ejus Cyrenen: Rasin autem interfecit.

10 Perrexitque rex Achaz in occursum Theglathphalasar regis Assyriorum in Damascum: cumque vidisset altare Damasci, misit rex Achaz ad Uriam sacerdotem exemplar ejus, et similitudinem juxta omne opus ejus.
11 Exstruxitque Urias sacerdos altare: juxta omnia quæ præceperat rex Achaz de Damasco, ita fecit sacerdos Urias donec veniret rex Achaz de Damasco.
12 Cumque venisset rex de Damasco, vidit altare, et veneratus est illud: ascenditque et immolavit holocausta et sacrificium suum,
13 et libavit libamina, et fudit sanguinem pacificorum quæ obtulerat super altare.
14 Porro altare æreum quod erat coram Domino, transtulit de facie templi, et de loco altaris, et de loco templi Domini: posuitque illud ex latere altaris ad aquilonem.
15 Præcepit quoque rex Achaz Uriæ sacerdoti, dicens: Super altare majus offer holocaustum matutinum, et sacrificium vespertinum, et holocaustum regis, et sacrificium ejus, et holocaustum universi populi terræ, et sacrificia eorum, et libamina eorum: et omnem sanguinem holocausti, et universum sanguinem victimæ super illud effundes: altare vero æreum erit paratum ad voluntatem meam.
16 Fecit igitur Urias sacerdos juxta omnia quæ præceperat rex Achaz.

17 Tulit autem rex Achaz cælatas bases, et luterem qui erat desuper: et mare deposuit de bobus æreis qui sustentabant illud, et posuit super pavimentum stratum lapide.
18 Musach quoque sabbati quod ædificaverat in templo: et ingressum regis exterius convertit in templum Domini propter regem Assyriorum.

19 Reliqua autem verborum Achaz quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Juda?
20 Dormivitque Achaz cum patribus suis, et sepultus est cum eis in civitate David: et regnavit Ezechias filius ejus pro eo.

1 ἐν ἔτει ἑπτακαιδεκάτῳ Φακεε υἱοῦ Ρομελιου ἐβασίλευσεν Αχαζ υἱὸς Ιωαθαμ βασιλέως Ιουδα
2 υἱὸς εἴκοσι ἐτῶν ἦν Αχαζ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ ἑκκαίδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησεν τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου θεοῦ αὐτοῦ πιστῶς ὡς Δαυιδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ
3 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ Ιεροβοαμ υἱοῦ Ναβατ βασιλέως Ισραηλ καί γε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ διῆγεν ἐν πυρὶ κατὰ τὰ βδελύγματα τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν ἐξῆρεν κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ
4 καὶ ἐθυσίαζεν καὶ ἐθυμία ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν βουνῶν καὶ ὑποκάτω παντὸς ξύλου ἀλσώδους

5 τότε ἀνέβη Ραασσων βασιλεὺς Συρίας καὶ Φακεε υἱὸς Ρομελιου βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ εἰς Ιερουσαλημ εἰς πόλεμον καὶ ἐπολιόρκουν ἐπὶ Αχαζ καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο πολεμεῖν
6 ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἐπέστρεψεν Ραασσων βασιλεὺς Συρίας τὴν Αιλαθ τῇ Συρίᾳ καὶ ἐξέβαλεν τοὺς Ιουδαίους ἐξ Αιλαθ καὶ Ιδουμαῖοι ἦλθον εἰς Αιλαθ καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐκεῖ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
7 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Αχαζ ἀγγέλους πρὸς Θαγλαθφελλασαρ βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων λέγων δοῦλός σου καὶ υἱός σου ἐγώ ἀνάβηθι καὶ σῶσόν με ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Συρίας καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Ισραηλ τῶν ἐπανισταμένων ἐ{P'} ἐμέ
8 καὶ ἔλαβεν Αχαζ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν θησαυροῖς οἴκου κυρίου καὶ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τῷ βασιλεῖ δῶρα
9 καὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτοῦ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων καὶ ἀνέβη βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων εἰς Δαμασκὸν καὶ συνέλαβεν αὐτὴν καὶ ἀπῴκισεν αὐτὴν καὶ τὸν Ραασσων ἐθανάτωσεν

10 καὶ ἐπορεύθη βασιλεὺς Αχαζ εἰς ἀπαντὴν τῷ Θαγλαθφελλασαρ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων εἰς Δαμασκόν καὶ εἶδεν τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐν Δαμασκῷ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Αχαζ πρὸς Ουριαν τὸν ἱερέα τὸ ὁμοίωμα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ τὸν ῥυθμὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς πᾶσαν ποίησιν αὐτοῦ
11 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν Ουριας ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ θυσιαστήριον κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Αχαζ ἐκ Δαμασκοῦ
12 καὶ εἶδεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ θυσιαστήριον καὶ ἀνέβη ἐ{P'} αὐτὸ
13 καὶ ἐθυμίασεν τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν θυσίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν σπονδὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ προσέχεεν τὸ αἷμα τῶν εἰρηνικῶν τῶν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον
14 καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χαλκοῦν τὸ ἀπέναντι κυρίου καὶ προσήγαγεν ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ οἴκου κυρίου ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ οἴκου κυρίου καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ μηρὸν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου κατὰ βορρᾶν
15 καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς Αχαζ τῷ Ουρια τῷ ἱερεῖ λέγων ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ μέγα πρόσφερε τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν τὴν πρωινὴν καὶ τὴν θυσίαν τὴν ἑσπερινὴν καὶ τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τὴν θυσίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τὴν θυσίαν αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν σπονδὴν αὐτῶν καὶ πᾶν αἷμα ὁλοκαυτώσεως καὶ πᾶν αἷμα θυσίας ἐ{P'} αὐτὸ προσχεεῖς καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χαλκοῦν ἔσται μοι εἰς τὸ πρωί
16 καὶ ἐποίησεν Ουριας ὁ ἱερεὺς κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεὺς Αχαζ

17 καὶ συνέκοψεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Αχαζ τὰ συγκλείσματα τῶν μεχωνωθ καὶ μετῆρεν ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν τὸν λουτῆρα καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν καθεῖλεν ἀπὸ τῶν βοῶν τῶν χαλκῶν τῶν ὑποκάτω αὐτῆς καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν ἐπὶ βάσιν λιθίνην
18 καὶ τὸν θεμέλιον τῆς καθέδρας ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου καὶ τὴν εἴσοδον τοῦ βασιλέως τὴν ἔξω ἐπέστρεψεν ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου ἀπὸ προσώπου βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων

19 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Αχαζ ὅσα ἐποίησεν οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ιουδα
20 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Αχαζ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Εζεκιας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
