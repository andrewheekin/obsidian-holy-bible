# Second Book of Kings 9 (RSVCE)

### Anointing of Jehu
1 Then Eliʹsha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, “Gird up your loins, and take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Raʹmoth-gilʹead.
2 And when you arrive, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshʹaphat, son of Nimshi; and go in and bid him rise from among his fellows, and lead him to an inner chamber.
3 Then take the flask of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, ‘Thus says theLord, I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and flee; do not tarry.”
4 So the young man, the prophet, went to Raʹmoth-gilʹead.
5 And when he came, behold, the commanders of the army were in council; and he said, “I have an errand to you, O commander.” And Jehu said, “To which of us all?” And he said, “To you, O commander.”
6 So he arose, and went into the house; and the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, “Thus says theLordthe God of Israel, I anoint you king over the people of theLord, over Israel.
7 And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge on Jezʹebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of theLord.
8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.
9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baʹasha the son of Ahiʹjah.
10 And the dogs shall eat Jezʹebel in the territory of Jezreʹel, and none shall bury her.” Then he opened the door, and fled.
11 When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they said to him, “Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the fellow and his talk.”
12 And they said, “That is not true; tell us now.” And he said, “Thus and so he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus says theLord, I anoint you king over Israel.’ ”
13 Then in haste every man of them took his garment, and put it under him on the bare steps, and they blew the trumpet, and proclaimed, “Jehu is king.”
### Joram of Israel Killed
14 Thus Jehu the son of Jehoshʹaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Raʹmoth-gilʹead against Hazʹael king of Syria;
15 but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreʹel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazʹael king of Syria.) So Jehu said, “If this is your mind, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreʹel.”
16 Then Jehu mounted his chariot, and went to Jezreʹel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziʹah king of Judah had come down to visit Joram.
17 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreʹel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.” And Joram said, “Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’ ”
18 So a man on horseback went to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’ ” And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Turn round and ride behind me.” And the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.”
19 Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them, and said, “Thus the king has said, ‘Is it peace?’ ” And Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace? Turn round and ride behind me.”
20 Again the watchman reported, “He reached them, but he is not coming back. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.”
21 Joram said, “Make ready.” And they made ready his chariot. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziʹah king of Judah set out, each in his chariot, and went to meet Jehu, and met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreʹelite.
22 And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” He answered, “What peace can there be, so long as the harlotries and the sorceries of your mother Jezʹebel are so many?”
23 Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahaziʹah, “Treachery, O Ahaziʹah!”
24 And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart, and he sank in his chariot.
25 Jehu said to Bidkar his aide, “Take him up, and cast him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreʹelite; for remember, when you and I rode side by side behind Ahab his father, how theLorduttered this oracle against him:
26 ‘As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons—says theLord—I will requite you on this plot of ground.’ Now therefore take him up and cast him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of theLord.”
### Ahaziah of Judah Killed
27 When Ahaziʹah the king of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him, and said, “Shoot him also”; and they shot him in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megidʹdo, and died there.
28 His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.
29 In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziʹah began to reign over Judah.
### Jezebel’s Violent Death
30 When Jehu came to Jezreʹel, Jezʹebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out of the window.
31 And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, “Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?”
32 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
33 He said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down; and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled on her.
34 Then he went in and ate and drank; and he said, “See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.”
35 But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
36 When they came back and told him, he said, “This is the word of theLord, which he spoke by his servant Eliʹjah the Tishbite, ‘In the territory of Jezreʹel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezʹebel;
37 and the corpse of Jezʹebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the territory of Jezreʹel, so that no one can say, This is Jezʹebel.’ ”


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 9 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Eliseus autem prophetes vocavit unum de filiis prophetarum, et ait illi: Accinge lumbos tuos, et tolle lenticulam olei hanc in manu tua, et vade in Ramoth Galaad.
2 Cumque veneris illuc, videbis Jehu filium Josaphat filii Namsi: et ingressus suscitabis eum de medio fratrum suorum, et introduces in interius cubiculum.
3 Tenensque lenticulam olei, fundes super caput ejus, et dices: Hæc dicit Dominus: Unxi te regem super Israël. Aperiesque ostium, et fugies, et non ibi subsistes.
4 Abiit ergo adolescens puer prophetæ in Ramoth Galaad,
5 et ingressus est illuc: ecce autem principes exercitus sedebant: et ait: Verbum mihi ad te, o princeps. Dixitque Jehu: Ad quem ex omnibus nobis? At ille dixit: Ad te, o princeps.
6 Et surrexit, et ingressus est cubiculum: at ille fudit oleum super caput ejus, et ait: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Unxi te regem super populum Domini Israël,
7 et percuties domum Achab domini tui, et ulciscar sanguinem servorum meorum prophetarum, et sanguinem omnium servorum Domini de manu Jezabel.
8 Perdamque omnem domum Achab: et interficiam de Achab mingentem ad parietem, et clausum et novissimum in Israël.
9 Et dabo domum Achab sicut domum Jeroboam filii Nabat, et sicut domum Baasa filii Ahia.
10 Jezabel quoque comedent canes in agro Jezrahel, nec erit qui sepeliat eam. Aperuitque ostium, et fugit.

11 Jehu autem egressus est ad servos domini sui: qui dixerunt ei: Rectene sunt omnia? quid venit insanus iste ad te? Qui ait eis: Nostis hominem, et quid locutus sit.
12 At ille responderunt: Falsum est, sed magis narra nobis. Qui ait eis: Hæc et hæc locutus est mihi, et ait: Hæc dicit Dominus: Unxi te regem super Israël.
13 Festinaverunt itaque, et unusquisque tollens pallium suum posuerunt sub pedibus ejus in similitudinem tribunalis, et cecinerunt tuba, atque dixerunt: Regnavit Jehu.

14 Conjuravit ergo Jehu filius Josaphat filii Namsi contra Joram: porro Joram obsederat Ramoth Galaad, ipse et omnis Israël contra Hazaël regem Syriæ:
15 et reversus fuerat ut curaretur in Jezrahel propter vulnera, quia percusserant eum Syri præliantem contra Hazaël regem Syriæ. Dixitque Jehu: Si placet vobis, nemo egrediatur profugus de civitate, ne vadat, et nuntiet in Jezrahel.
16 Et ascendit, et profectus est in Jezrahel: Joram enim ægrotabat ibi, et Ochozias rex Juda descenderat ad visitandum Joram.
17 Igitur speculator qui stabat super turrim Jezrahel, vidit globum Jehu venientis, et ait: Video ego globum. Dixitque Joram: Tolle currum, et mitte in occursum eorum, et dicat vadens: Rectene sunt omnia?
18 Abiit ergo qui ascenderat currum, in occursum ejus, et ait: Hæc dicit rex: Pacatane sunt omnia? Dixitque Jehu: Quid tibi et paci? transi, et sequere me. Nuntiavit quoque speculator, dicens: Venit nuntius ad eos, et non revertitur.
19 Misit etiam currum equorum secundum: venitque ad eos, et ait: Hæc dicit rex: Numquid pax est? Et ait Jehu: Quid tibi et paci? transi, et sequere me.
20 Nuntiavit autem speculator, dicens: Venit usque ad eos, et non revertitur: est autem incessus quasi incessus Jehu filii Namsi, præceps enim graditur.

21 Et ait Joram: Junge currum. Junxeruntque currum ejus, et egressus est Joram rex Israël, et Ochozias rex Juda, singuli in curribus suis, egressique sunt in occursum Jehu, et invenerunt eum in agro Naboth Jezrahelitæ.

22 Cumque vidisset Joram Jehu, dixit: Pax est, Jehu? At ille respondit: Quæ pax? adhuc fornicationes Jezabel matris tuæ, et veneficia ejus multa, vigent.
23 Convertit autem Joram manum suam, et fugiens ait ad Ochoziam: Insidiæ, Ochozia.
24 Porro Jehu tetendit arcum manu, et percussit Joram inter scapulas: et egressa est sagitta per cor ejus, statimque corruit in curru suo.
25 Dixitque Jehu ad Badacer ducem: Tolle, projice eum in agro Naboth Jezrahelitæ: memini enim quando ego et tu sedentes in curru sequebamur Achab patrem hujus, quod Dominus onus hoc levaverit super eum, dicens:
26 Si non pro sanguine Naboth, et pro sanguine filiorum ejus, quem vidi heri, ait Dominus, reddam tibi in agro isto, dicit Dominus. Nunc ergo tolle, et projice eum in agrum juxta verbum Domini.

27 Ochozias autem rex Juda videns hoc, fugit per viam domus horti: persecutusque est eum Jehu, et ait: Etiam hunc percutite in curru suo. Et percusserunt eum in ascensu Gaver, qui est juxta Jeblaam: qui fugit in Mageddo, et mortuus est ibi.
28 Et imposuerunt eum servi ejus super currum suum, et tulerunt in Jerusalem: sepelieruntque eum in sepulchro cum patribus suis in civitate David.
29 Anno undecimo Joram filii Achab, regnavit Ochozias super Judam,

30 venitque Jehu in Jezrahel. Porro Jezabel, introitu ejus audito, depinxit oculos suos stibio, et ornavit caput suum, et respexit per fenestram
31 ingredientem Jehu per portam, et ait: Numquid pax potest esse Zambri, qui interfecit dominum suum?
32 Levavitque Jehu faciem suam ad fenestram, et ait: Quæ est ista? et inclinaverunt se ad eum duo vel tres eunuchi.
33 At ille dixit eis: Præcipitate eam deorsum: et præcipitaverunt eam, aspersusque est sanguine paries, et equorum ungulæ conculcaverunt eam.
34 Cumque introgressus esset ut comederet biberetque, ait: Ite, et videte maledictam illam, et sepelite eam: quia filia regis est.
35 Cumque issent ut sepelirent eam, non invenerunt nisi calvariam, et pedes, et summas manus.
36 Reversique nuntiaverunt ei. Et ait Jehu: Sermo Domini est, quem locutus est per servum suum Eliam Thesbiten, dicens: In agro Jezrahel comedent canes carnes Jezabel,
37 et erunt carnes Jezabel sicut stercus super faciem terræ in agro Jezrahel, ita ut prætereuntes dicant: Hæccine est illa Jezabel?

1 καὶ Ελισαιε ὁ προφήτης ἐκάλεσεν ἕνα τῶν υἱῶν τῶν προφητῶν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ζῶσαι τὴν ὀσφύν σου καὶ λαβὲ τὸν φακὸν τοῦ ἐλαίου τούτου ἐν τῇ χειρί σου καὶ δεῦρο εἰς Ρεμμωθ Γαλααδ
2 καὶ εἰσελεύσῃ ἐκεῖ καὶ ὄψῃ ἐκεῖ Ιου υἱὸν Ιωσαφατ υἱοῦ Ναμεσσι καὶ εἰσελεύσῃ καὶ ἀναστήσεις αὐτὸν ἐκ μέσου τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσάξεις αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ ταμίειον ἐν τῷ ταμιείῳ
3 καὶ λήμψῃ τὸν φακὸν τοῦ ἐλαίου καὶ ἐπιχεεῖς ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰπόν τάδε λέγει κύριος κέχρικά σε εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἀνοίξεις τὴν θύραν καὶ φεύξῃ καὶ οὐ μενεῖς
4 καὶ ἐπορεύθη τὸ παιδάριον ὁ προφήτης εἰς Ρεμμωθ Γαλααδ
5 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ ἄρχοντες τῆς δυνάμεως ἐκάθηντο καὶ εἶπεν λόγος μοι πρὸς σέ ὁ ἄρχων καὶ εἶπεν Ιου πρὸς τίνα ἐκ πάντων ἡμῶν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς σέ ὁ ἄρχων
6 καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον καὶ ἐπέχεεν τὸ ἔλαιον ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τάδε λέγει κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ κέχρικά σε εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ λαὸν κυρίου ἐπὶ τὸν Ισραηλ
7 καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσεις τὸν οἶκον Αχααβ τοῦ κυρίου σου ἐκ προσώπου μου καὶ ἐκδικήσεις τὰ αἵματα τῶν δούλων μου τῶν προφητῶν καὶ τὰ αἵματα πάντων τῶν δούλων κυρίου ἐκ χειρὸς Ιεζαβελ
8 καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς ὅλου τοῦ οἴκου Αχααβ καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσεις τῷ οἴκῳ Αχααβ οὐροῦντα πρὸς τοῖχον καὶ συνεχόμενον καὶ ἐγκαταλελειμμένον ἐν Ισραηλ
9 καὶ δώσω τὸν οἶκον Αχααβ ὡς τὸν οἶκον Ιεροβοαμ υἱοῦ Ναβατ καὶ ὡς τὸν οἶκον Βαασα υἱοῦ Αχια
10 καὶ τὴν Ιεζαβελ καταφάγονται οἱ κύνες ἐν τῇ μερίδι Ιεζραελ καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ θάπτων καὶ ἤνοιξεν τὴν θύραν καὶ ἔφυγεν

11 καὶ Ιου ἐξῆλθεν πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ εἰ εἰρήνη τί ὅτι εἰσῆλθεν ὁ ἐπίλημπτος οὗτος πρὸς σέ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὑμεῖς οἴδατε τὸν ἄνδρα καὶ τὴν ἀδολεσχίαν αὐτοῦ
12 καὶ εἶπον ἄδικον ἀπάγγειλον δὴ ἡμῖν καὶ εἶπεν Ιου πρὸς αὐτούς οὕτως καὶ οὕτως ἐλάλησεν πρός με λέγων τάδε λέγει κύριος κέχρικά σε εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ισραηλ
13 καὶ ἀκούσαντες ἔσπευσαν καὶ ἔλαβον ἕκαστος τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθηκαν ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ γαρεμ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ἐν κερατίνῃ καὶ εἶπον ἐβασίλευσεν Ιου

14 καὶ συνεστράφη Ιου υἱὸς Ιωσαφατ υἱοῦ Ναμεσσι πρὸς Ιωραμ καὶ Ιωραμ αὐτὸς ἐφύλασσεν ἐν Ρεμμωθ Γαλααδ αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ ἀπὸ προσώπου Αζαηλ βασιλέως Συρίας
15 καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Ιωραμ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἰατρευθῆναι ἐν Ιεζραελ ἀπὸ τῶν πληγῶν ὧν ἔπαισαν αὐτὸν οἱ Σύροι ἐν τῷ πολεμεῖν αὐτὸν μετὰ Αζαηλ βασιλέως Συρίας καὶ εἶπεν Ιου εἰ ἔστιν ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν με{T'} ἐμοῦ μὴ ἐξελθέτω ἐκ τῆς πόλεως διαπεφευγὼς τοῦ πορευθῆναι καὶ ἀπαγγεῖλαι ἐν Ιεζραελ
16 καὶ ἵππευσεν καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ιου καὶ κατέβη εἰς Ιεζραελ ὅτι Ιωραμ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ ἐθεραπεύετο ἐν Ιεζραελ ἀπὸ τῶν τοξευμάτων ὧν κατετόξευσαν αὐτὸν οἱ Αραμιν ἐν τῇ Ραμμαθ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ μετὰ Αζαηλ βασιλέως Συρίας ὅτι αὐτὸς δυνατὸς καὶ ἀνὴρ δυνάμεως καὶ Οχοζιας βασιλεὺς Ιουδα κατέβη ἰδεῖν τὸν Ιωραμ
17 καὶ ὁ σκοπὸς ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὸν πύργον ἐν Ιεζραελ καὶ εἶδεν τὸν κονιορτὸν Ιου ἐν τῷ παραγίνεσθαι αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν Κονιορτὸν ἐγὼ βλέπω καὶ εἶπεν Ιωραμ λαβὲ ἐπιβάτην καὶ ἀπόστειλον ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν καὶ εἰπάτω εἰ εἰρήνη
18 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐπιβάτης ἵππου εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπεν τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεύς εἰ εἰρήνη καὶ εἶπεν Ιου τί σοι καὶ εἰρήνῃ ἐπίστρεφε εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω μου καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν ὁ σκοπὸς λέγων ἦλθεν ὁ ἄγγελος ἕως αὐτῶν καὶ οὐκ ἀνέστρεψεν
19 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἐπιβάτην ἵππου δεύτερον καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεύς εἰ εἰρήνη καὶ εἶπεν Ιου τί σοι καὶ εἰρήνῃ ἐπιστρέφου εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω μου
20 καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν ὁ σκοπὸς λέγων ἦλθεν ἕως αὐτῶν καὶ οὐκ ἀνέστρεψεν καὶ ὁ ἄγων ἦγεν τὸν Ιου υἱὸν Ναμεσσιου ὅτι ἐν παραλλαγῇ ἐγένετο

21 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωραμ ζεῦξον καὶ ἔζευξεν ἅρμα καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ιωραμ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ Οχοζιας βασιλεὺς Ιουδα ἀνὴρ ἐν τῷ ἅρματι αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξῆλθον εἰς ἀπαντὴν Ιου καὶ εὗρον αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ μερίδι Ναβουθαι τοῦ Ιεζραηλίτου

22 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδεν Ιωραμ τὸν Ιου καὶ εἶπεν εἰ εἰρήνη Ιου καὶ εἶπεν Ιου τί εἰρήνη ἔτι αἱ πορνεῖαι Ιεζαβελ τῆς μητρός σου καὶ τὰ φάρμακα αὐτῆς τὰ πολλά
23 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ιωραμ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ τοῦ φυγεῖν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Οχοζιαν δόλος Οχοζια
24 καὶ ἔπλησεν Ιου τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ τόξῳ καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὸν Ιωραμ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν βραχιόνων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν τὸ βέλος διὰ τῆς καρδίας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔκαμψεν ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατα αὐτοῦ
25 καὶ εἶπεν Ιου πρὸς Βαδεκαρ τὸν τριστάτην αὐτοῦ ῥῖψον αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ μερίδι ἀγροῦ Ναβουθαι τοῦ Ιεζραηλίτου ὅτι μνημονεύω ἐγὼ καὶ σὺ ἐπιβεβηκότες ἐπὶ ζεύγη ὀπίσω Αχααβ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ κύριος ἔλαβεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν τὸ λῆμμα τοῦτο λέγων
26 εἰ μὴ μετὰ τῶν αἱμάτων Ναβουθαι καὶ τὰ αἵματα τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ εἶδον ἐχθές φησὶν κύριος καὶ ἀνταποδώσω αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ μερίδι ταύτῃ φησὶν κύριος καὶ νῦν ἄρας δὴ ῥῖψον αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ μερίδι κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου

27 καὶ Οχοζιας βασιλεὺς Ιουδα εἶδεν καὶ ἔφυγεν ὁδὸν Βαιθαγγαν καὶ ἐδίωξεν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ Ιου καὶ εἶπεν καί γε αὐτόν καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ἅρματι ἐν τῷ ἀναβαίνειν Γαι ἥ ἐστιν Ιεβλααμ καὶ ἔφυγεν εἰς Μαγεδδων καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ
28 καὶ ἐπεβίβασαν αὐτὸν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ
29 καὶ ἐν ἔτει ἑνδεκάτῳ Ιωραμ βασιλέως Ισραηλ ἐβασίλευσεν Οχοζιας ἐπὶ Ιουδαν

30 καὶ ἦλθεν Ιου εἰς Ιεζραελ καὶ Ιεζαβελ ἤκουσεν καὶ ἐστιμίσατο τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῆς καὶ ἠγάθυνεν τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῆς καὶ διέκυψεν διὰ τῆς θυρίδος
31 καὶ Ιου εἰσεπορεύετο ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ εἶπεν εἰ εἰρήνη Ζαμβρι ὁ φονευτὴς τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ
32 καὶ ἐπῆρεν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν θυρίδα καὶ εἶδεν αὐτὴν καὶ εἶπεν τίς εἶ σύ κατάβηθι με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ κατέκυψαν πρὸς αὐτὸν δύο εὐνοῦχοι
33 καὶ εἶπεν κυλίσατε αὐτήν καὶ ἐκύλισαν αὐτήν καὶ ἐρραντίσθη τοῦ αἵματος αὐτῆς πρὸς τὸν τοῖχον καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἵππους καὶ συνεπάτησαν αὐτήν
34 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ιου καὶ ἔφαγεν καὶ ἔπιεν καὶ εἶπεν ἐπισκέψασθε δὴ τὴν κατηραμένην ταύτην καὶ θάψατε αὐτήν ὅτι θυγάτηρ βασιλέως ἐστίν
35 καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν θάψαι αὐτὴν καὶ οὐχ εὗρον ἐν αὐτῇ ἄλλο τι ἢ τὸ κρανίον καὶ οἱ πόδες καὶ τὰ ἴχνη τῶν χειρῶν
36 καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτῷ καὶ εἶπεν λόγος κυρίου ὃν ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ δούλου αὐτοῦ Ηλιου τοῦ Θεσβίτου λέγων ἐν τῇ μερίδι Ιεζραελ καταφάγονται οἱ κύνες τὰς σάρκας Ιεζαβελ
37 καὶ ἔσται τὸ θνησιμαῖον Ιεζαβελ ὡς κοπρία ἐπὶ προσώπου τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἐν τῇ μερίδι Ιεζραελ ὥστε μὴ εἰπεῖν αὐτούς Ιεζαβελ
