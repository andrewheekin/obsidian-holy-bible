# Second Book of Kings 12 (RSVCE)

### The Temple Repaired
1 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoʹash began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibʹiah of Beer-sheba.
2 And Jehoʹash did what was right in the eyes of theLordall his days, because Jehoiʹada the priest instructed him.
3 Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people continued to sacrifice and burn incense on the high places.
4 Jehoʹash said to the priests, “All the money of the holy things which is brought into the house of theLord, the money for which each man is assessed—the money from the assessment of persons—and the money which a man’s heart prompts him to bring into the house of theLord,
5 let the priests take, each from his acquaintance; and let them repair the house wherever any need of repairs is discovered.”
6 But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoʹash the priests had made no repairs on the house.
7 Therefore King Jehoʹash summoned Jehoiʹada the priest and the other priests and said to them, “Why are you not repairing the house? Now therefore take no more money from your acquaintances, but hand it over for the repair of the house.”
8 So the priests agreed that they should take no more money from the people, and that they should not repair the house.
9 Then Jehoiʹada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the house of theLord; and the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money that was brought into the house of theLord.
10 And whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king’s secretary and the high priest came up and they counted and tied up in bags the money that was found in the house of theLord.
11 Then they would give the money that was weighed out into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of theLord; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked upon the house of theLord,
12 and to the masons and the stonecutters, as well as to buy timber and quarried stone for making repairs on the house of theLord, and for any outlay upon the repairs of the house.
13 But there were not made for the house of theLordbasins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any vessels of gold, or of silver, from the money that was brought into the house of theLord,
14 for that was given to the workmen who were repairing the house of theLordwith it.
15 And they did not ask an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to pay out to the workmen, for they dealt honestly.
16 The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of theLord; it belonged to the priests.
### Hazael Threatens Jerusalem
17 At that time Hazʹael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath, and took it. But when Hazʹael set his face to go up against Jerusalem,
18 Jehoʹash king of Judah took all the votive gifts that Jehoshʹaphat and Jehorʹam and Ahaziʹah, his fathers, the kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own votive gifts, and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of theLordand of the king’s house, and sent these to Hazʹael king of Syria. Then Hazʹael went away from Jerusalem.
### Death of Joash
19 Now the rest of the acts of Joʹash, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
20 His servants arose and made a conspiracy, and slew Joʹash in the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.
21 It was Joʹzacar the son of Shimʹeath and Jehoʹzabad the son of Shomer, his servants, who struck him down, so that he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amaziʹah his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 12 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno septimo Jehu, regnavit Joas: et quadraginta annis regnavit in Jerusalem. Nomen matris ejus Sebia de Bersabee.
2 Fecitque Joas rectum coram Domino cunctis diebus quibus docuit eum Jojada sacerdos.
3 Verumtamen excelsa non abstulit: adhuc enim populus immolabat, et adolebat in excelsis incensum.

4 Dixitque Joas ad sacerdotes: Omnem pecuniam sanctorum, quæ illata fuerit in templum Domini a prætereuntibus, quæ offertur pro pretio animæ, et quam sponte et arbitrio cordis sui inferunt in templum Domini:
5 accipiant illam sacerdotes juxta ordinem suum, et instaurent sartatecta domus, si quid necessarium viderint instauratione.
6 Igitur usque ad vigesimum tertium annum regis Joas, non instauraverunt sacerdotes sartatecta templi.
7 Vocavitque rex Joas Jojadam pontificem et sacerdotes, dicens eis: Quare sartatecta non instauratis templi? nolite ergo amplius accipere pecuniam juxta ordinem vestrum, sed ad instaurationem templi reddite eam.
8 Prohibitique sunt sacerdotes ultra accipere pecuniam a populo, et instaurare sartatecta domus.
9 Et tulit Jojada pontifex gazophylacium unum, aperuitque foramen desuper, et posuit illud juxta altare ad dexteram ingredientium domum Domini: mittebantque in eo sacerdotes qui custodiebant ostia, omnem pecuniam quæ deferebatur ad templum Domini.

10 Cumque viderent nimiam pecuniam esse in gazophylacio, ascendebat scriba regis, et pontifex, effundebantque et numerabant pecuniam quæ inveniebatur in domo Domini:
11 et dabant eam juxta numerum atque mensuram in manu eorum qui præerant cæmentariis domus Domini: qui impendebant eam in fabris lignorum et in cæmentariis, iis qui operabantur in domo Domini,
12 et sartatecta faciebant: et in iis qui cædebant saxa, et ut emerent ligna, et lapides, qui excidebantur, ita ut impleretur instauratio domus Domini in universis quæ indigebant expensa ad muniendam domum.
13 Verumtamen non fiebant ex eadem pecunia hydriæ templi Domini, et fuscinulæ, et thuribula, et tubæ, et omne vas aureum et argenteum, de pecunia quæ inferebatur in templum Domini.
14 Iis enim qui faciebant opus, dabatur ut instauraretur templum Domini:
15 et non fiebat ratio iis hominibus qui accipiebant pecuniam ut distribuerent eam artificibus, sed in fide tractabant eam.
16 Pecuniam vero pro delicto, et pecuniam pro peccatis non inferebant in templum Domini, quia sacerdotum erat.

17 Tunc ascendit Hazaël rex Syriæ, et pugnabat contra Geth, cepitque eam: et direxit faciem suam ut ascenderet in Jerusalem.
18 Quam ob rem tulit Joas rex Juda omnia sanctificata quæ consecraverant Josaphat, et Joram, et Ochozias, patres ejus reges Juda, et quæ ipse obtulerat: et universum argentum quod inveniri potuit in thesauris templi Domini et in palatio regis: misitque Hazaëli regi Syriæ, et recessit ab Jerusalem.
19 Reliqua autem sermonum Joas, et universa quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Juda?
20 Surrexerunt autem servi ejus, et conjuraverunt inter se, percusseruntque Joas in domo Mello in descensu Sella.
21 Josachar namque filius Semaath, et Jozabad filius Somer servi ejus, percusserunt eum, et mortuus est: et sepelierunt eum cum patribus suis in civitate David: regnavitque Amasias filius ejus pro eo.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 12 (Septuagint)

1 ἐν ἔτει ἑβδόμῳ τῷ Ιου ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωας καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Αβια ἐκ τῆς Βηρσαβεε
2 καὶ ἐποίησεν Ιωας τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον κυρίου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ἐφώτισεν αὐτὸν Ιωδαε ὁ ἱερεύς
3 πλὴν τῶν ὑψηλῶν οὐ μετεστάθησαν καὶ ἐκεῖ ἔτι ὁ λαὸς ἐθυσίαζεν καὶ ἐθυμίων ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς

4 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωας πρὸς τοὺς ἱερεῖς πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον τῶν ἁγίων τὸ εἰσοδιαζόμενον ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ κυρίου ἀργύριον συντιμήσεως ἀνὴρ ἀργύριον λαβὼν συντιμήσεως πᾶν ἀργύριον ὃ ἐὰν ἀναβῇ ἐπὶ καρδίαν ἀνδρὸς ἐνεγκεῖν ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου
5 λαβέτωσαν ἑαυτοῖς οἱ ἱερεῖς ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τῆς πράσεως αὐτῶν καὶ αὐτοὶ κρατήσουσιν τὸ βεδεκ τοῦ οἴκου εἰς πάντα οὗ ἐὰν εὑρεθῇ ἐκεῖ βεδεκ
6 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ εἰκοστῷ καὶ τρίτῳ ἔτει τῷ βασιλεῖ Ιωας οὐκ ἐκραταίωσαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὸ βεδεκ τοῦ οἴκου
7 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ιωας ὁ βασιλεὺς Ιωδαε τὸν ἱερέα καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς τί ὅτι οὐκ ἐκραταιοῦτε τὸ βεδεκ τοῦ οἴκου καὶ νῦν μὴ λάβητε ἀργύριον ἀπὸ τῶν πράσεων ὑμῶν ὅτι εἰς τὸ βεδεκ τοῦ οἴκου δώσετε αὐτό
8 καὶ συνεφώνησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τοῦ μὴ λαβεῖν ἀργύριον παρὰ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τοῦ μὴ ἐνισχῦσαι τὸ βεδεκ τοῦ οἴκου
9 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ιωδαε ὁ ἱερεὺς κιβωτὸν μίαν καὶ ἔτρησεν τρώγλην ἐπὶ τῆς σανίδος αὐτῆς καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν παρὰ ιαμιβιν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ἀνδρὸς οἴκου κυρίου καὶ ἔδωκαν οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ φυλάσσοντες τὸν σταθμὸν πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου

10 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδον ὅτι πολὺ τὸ ἀργύριον ἐν τῇ κιβωτῷ καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ γραμματεὺς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας καὶ ἔσφιγξαν καὶ ἠρίθμησαν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου
11 καὶ ἔδωκαν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ ἑτοιμασθὲν ἐπὶ χεῖρας ποιούντων τὰ ἔργα τῶν ἐπισκόπων οἴκου κυρίου καὶ ἐξέδοσαν τοῖς τέκτοσιν τῶν ξύλων καὶ τοῖς οἰκοδόμοις τοῖς ποιοῦσιν ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου
12 καὶ τοῖς τειχισταῖς καὶ τοῖς λατόμοις τῶν λίθων τοῦ κτήσασθαι ξύλα καὶ λίθους λατομητοὺς τοῦ κατασχεῖν τὸ βεδεκ οἴκου κυρίου εἰς πάντα ὅσα ἐξωδιάσθη ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ κραταιῶσαι
13 πλὴν οὐ ποιηθήσεται οἴκῳ κυρίου θύραι ἀργυραῖ ἧλοι φιάλαι καὶ σάλπιγγες πᾶν σκεῦος χρυσοῦν καὶ σκεῦος ἀργυροῦν ἐκ τοῦ ἀργυρίου τοῦ εἰσενεχθέντος ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου
14 ὅτι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν τὰ ἔργα δώσουσιν αὐτό καὶ ἐκραταίωσαν ἐν αὐτῷ τὸν οἶκον κυρίου
15 καὶ οὐκ ἐξελογίζοντο τοὺς ἄνδρας οἷς ἐδίδουν τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ χεῖρας αὐτῶν δοῦναι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν τὰ ἔργα ὅτι ἐν πίστει αὐτῶν ποιοῦσιν
16 ἀργύριον περὶ ἁμαρτίας καὶ ἀργύριον περὶ πλημμελείας ὅ τι εἰσηνέχθη ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ἐγένετο

17 τότε ἀνέβη Αζαηλ βασιλεὺς Συρίας καὶ ἐπολέμησεν ἐπὶ Γεθ καὶ προκατελάβετο αὐτήν καὶ ἔταξεν Αζαηλ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀναβῆναι ἐπὶ Ιερουσαλημ
18 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ιωας βασιλεὺς Ιουδα πάντα τὰ ἅγια ὅσα ἡγίασεν Ιωσαφατ καὶ Ιωραμ καὶ Οχοζιας οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ καὶ βασιλεῖς Ιουδα καὶ τὰ ἅγια αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶν τὸ χρυσίον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν θησαυροῖς οἴκου κυρίου καὶ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τῷ Αζαηλ βασιλεῖ Συρίας καὶ ἀνέβη ἀπὸ Ιερουσαλημ
19 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ιωας καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ιουδα
20 καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδησαν πάντα σύνδεσμον καὶ ἐπάταξαν τὸν Ιωας ἐν οἴκῳ Μαλλω τῷ ἐν Γααλλα
21 καὶ Ιεζιχαρ υἱὸς Ιεμουαθ καὶ Ιεζεβουθ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ Σωμηρ οἱ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ ἐπάταξαν αὐτόν καὶ ἀπέθανεν καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Αμεσσιας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
