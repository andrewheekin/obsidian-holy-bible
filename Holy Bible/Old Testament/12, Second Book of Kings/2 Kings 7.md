# Second Book of Kings 7 (RSVCE)

1 But Eliʹsha said, “Hear the word of theLord: thus says theLord, Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine meal shall be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samarʹia.”
2 Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned said to the man of God, “If theLordhimself should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?” But he said, “You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it.”
### The Arameans Flee
3 Now there were four men who were lepers at the entrance to the gate; and they said to one another, “Why do we sit here till we die?
4 If we say, ‘Let us enter the city,’ the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit here, we die also. So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians; if they spare our lives we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but die.”
5 So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; but when they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no one there.
6 For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians hear the sound of chariots, and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, “Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come upon us.”
7 So they fled away in the twilight and forsook their tents, their horses, and their asses, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their lives.
8 And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent, and ate and drank, and they carried off silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid them; then they came back, and entered another tent, and carried off things from it, and went and hid them.
9 Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news; if we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.”
10 So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, “We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.”
11 Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king’s household.
12 And the king rose in the night, and said to his servants, “I will tell you what the Syrians have prepared against us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive and get into the city.’ ”
13 And one of his servants said, “Let some men take five of the remaining horses, seeing that those who are left here will fare like the whole multitude of Israel that have already perished; let us send and see.”
14 So they took two mounted men, and the king sent them after the army of the Syrians, saying, “Go and see.”
15 So they went after them as far as the Jordan; and lo, all the way was littered with garments and equipment which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
16 Then the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine meal was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of theLord.
17 Now the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate; and the people trod upon him in the gate, so that he died, as the man of God had said when the king came down to him.
18 For when the man of God had said to the king, “Two measures of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a measure of fine meal for a shekel, about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samarʹia,”
19 the captain had answered the man of God, “If theLordhimself should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?” And he had said, “You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it.”
20 And so it happened to him, for the people trod upon him in the gate and he died.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 7 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dixit autem Eliseus: Audite verbum Domini: Hæc dicit Dominus: In tempore hoc cras modius similæ uno statere erit, et duo modii hordei statere uno, in porta Samariæ.
2 Respondens unus de ducibus, super cujus manum rex incumbebat, homini Dei, ait: Si Dominus fecerit etiam cataractas in cælo, numquid poterit esse quod loqueris? Qui ait: Videbis oculis tuis, et inde non comedes.

3 Quatuor ergo viri erant leprosi juxta introitum portæ: qui dixerunt ad invicem: Quid hic esse volumus donec moriamur?
4 sive ingredi voluerimus civitatem, fame moriemur: sive manserimus hic, moriendum nobis est: venite ergo, et transfugiamus ad castra Syriæ: si pepercerint nobis, vivemus: si autem occidere voluerint, nihilominus moriemur.
5 Surrexerunt ergo vesperi, ut venirent ad castra Syriæ. Cumque venissent ad principium castrorum Syriæ, nullum ibidem repererunt.
6 Siquidem Dominus sonitum audiri fecerat in castris Syriæ, curruum, et equorum, et exercitus plurimi: dixeruntque ad invicem: Ecce mercede conduxit adversum nos rex Israël reges Hethæorum et Ægyptiorum, et venerunt super nos.
7 Surrexerunt ergo, et fugerunt in tenebris, et dereliquerunt tentoria sua, et equos et asinos, in castris, fugeruntque animas tantum suas salvare cupientes.
8 Igitur cum venissent leprosi illi ad principium castrorum, ingressi sunt unum tabernaculum, et comederunt et biberunt: tuleruntque inde argentum, et aurum, et vestes, et abierunt, et absconderunt: et rursum reversi sunt ad aliud tabernaculum, et inde similiter auferentes absconderunt.
9 Dixeruntque ad invicem: Non recte facimus: hæc enim dies boni nuntii est. Si tacuerimus et noluerimus nuntiare usque mane, sceleris arguemur: venite, eamus, et nuntiemus in aula regis.

10 Cumque venissent ad portam civitatis, narraverunt eis, dicentes: Ivimus ad castra Syriæ, et nullum ibidem reperimus hominem, nisi equos et asinos alligatos, et fixa tentoria.
11 Ierunt ergo portarii, et nuntiaverunt in palatio regis intrinsecus.
12 Qui surrexit nocte, et ait ad servos suos: Dico vobis quid fecerint nobis Syri: sciunt quia fame laboramus, et idcirco egressi sunt de castris, et latitant in agris, dicentes: Cum egressi fuerint de civitate, capiemus eos vivos, et tunc civitatem ingredi poterimus.
13 Respondit autem unus servorum ejus: Tollamus quinque equos qui remanserunt in urbe (quia ipsi tantum sunt in universa multitudine Israël, alii enim consumpti sunt), et mittentes, explorare poterimus.
14 Adduxerunt ergo duos equos, misitque rex in castra Syrorum, dicens: Ite, et videte.
15 Qui abierunt post eos usque ad Jordanem: ecce autem omnis via plena erat vestibus et vasis quæ projecerant Syri cum turbarentur: reversique nuntii indicaverunt regi.

16 Et egressus populus diripuit castra Syriæ: factusque est modius similæ statere uno, et duo modii hordei statere uno, juxta verbum Domini.
17 Porro rex ducem illum, in cujus manu incumbebat, constituit ad portam: quem conculcavit turba in introitu portæ, et mortuus est, juxta quod locutus fuerat vir Dei, quando descenderat rex ad eum.
18 Factumque est secundum sermonem viri Dei quem dixerat regi, quando ait: Duo modii hordei statere uno erunt, et modius similæ statere uno, hoc eodem tempore cras in porta Samariæ:
19 quando responderat dux ille viro Dei, et dixerat: Etiamsi Dominus fecerit cataractas in cælo, numquid poterit fieri quod loqueris? Et dixit ei: Videbis oculis tuis, et inde non comedes.
20 Evenit ergo ei sicut prædictum fuerat, et conculcavit eum populus in porta, et mortuus est.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 7 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε ἄκουσον λόγον κυρίου τάδε λέγει κύριος ὡς ἡ ὥρα αὕτη αὔριον μέτρον σεμιδάλεως σίκλου καὶ δίμετρον κριθῶν σίκλου ἐν ταῖς πύλαις Σαμαρείας
2 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ τριστάτης ἐ{F'} ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπανεπαύετο ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ τῷ Ελισαιε καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ποιήσει κύριος καταρράκτας ἐν οὐρανῷ μὴ ἔσται τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο καὶ Ελισαιε εἶπεν ἰδοὺ σὺ ὄψῃ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου καὶ ἐκεῖθεν οὐ φάγῃ

3 καὶ τέσσαρες ἄνδρες ἦσαν λεπροὶ παρὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς πόλεως καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ τί ἡμεῖς καθήμεθα ὧδε ἕως ἀποθάνωμεν
4 ἐὰν εἴπωμεν εἰσέλθωμεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ ὁ λιμὸς ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ ἀποθανούμεθα ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐὰν καθίσωμεν ὧδε καὶ ἀποθανούμεθα καὶ νῦν δεῦτε καὶ ἐμπέσωμεν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Συρίας ἐὰν ζωογονήσωσιν ἡμᾶς καὶ ζησόμεθα καὶ ἐὰν θανατώσωσιν ἡμᾶς καὶ ἀποθανούμεθα
5 καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἐν τῷ σκότει εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Συρίας καὶ ἦλθον εἰς μέρος τῆς παρεμβολῆς Συρίας καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνὴρ ἐκεῖ
6 καὶ κύριος ἀκουστὴν ἐποίησεν τὴν παρεμβολὴν Συρίας φωνὴν ἅρματος καὶ φωνὴν ἵππου καὶ φωνὴν δυνάμεως μεγάλης καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ νῦν ἐμισθώσατο ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ τοὺς βασιλέας τῶν Χετταίων καὶ τοὺς βασιλέας Αἰγύπτου τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς
7 καὶ ἀνέστησαν καὶ ἀπέδρασαν ἐν τῷ σκότει καὶ ἐγκατέλιπαν τὰς σκηνὰς αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς ἵππους αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς ὄνους αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ ὡς ἔστιν καὶ ἔφυγον πρὸς τὴν ψυχὴν ἑαυτῶν
8 καὶ εἰσῆλθον οἱ λεπροὶ οὗτοι ἕως μέρους τῆς παρεμβολῆς καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς σκηνὴν μίαν καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἔπιον καὶ ἦραν ἐκεῖθεν ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ ἱματισμὸν καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς σκηνὴν ἄλλην καὶ ἔλαβον ἐκεῖθεν καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν καὶ κατέκρυψαν
9 καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ οὐχ οὕτως ἡμεῖς ποιοῦμεν ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη ἡμέρα εὐαγγελίας ἐστίν καὶ ἡμεῖς σιωπῶμεν καὶ μένομεν ἕως φωτὸς τοῦ πρωὶ καὶ εὑρήσομεν ἀνομίαν καὶ νῦν δεῦρο καὶ εἰσέλθωμεν καὶ ἀναγγείλωμεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως

10 καὶ εἰσῆλθον καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτοῖς λέγοντες εἰσήλθομεν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Συρίας καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκεῖ ἀνὴρ καὶ φωνὴ ἀνθρώπου ὅτι εἰ μὴ ἵππος δεδεμένος καὶ ὄνος καὶ αἱ σκηναὶ αὐτῶν ὡς εἰσίν
11 καὶ ἐβόησαν οἱ θυρωροὶ καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως ἔσω
12 καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ βασιλεὺς νυκτὸς καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ ἀναγγελῶ δὴ ὑμῖν ἃ ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν Συρία ἔγνωσαν ὅτι πεινῶμεν ἡμεῖς καὶ ἐξῆλθαν ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς καὶ ἐκρύβησαν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ λέγοντες ὅτι ἐξελεύσονται ἐκ τῆς πόλεως καὶ συλλημψόμεθα αὐτοὺς ζῶντας καὶ εἰς τὴν πόλιν εἰσελευσόμεθα
13 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη εἷς τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν λαβέτωσαν δὴ πέντε τῶν ἵππων τῶν ὑπολελειμμένων οἳ κατελείφθησαν ὧδε ἰδού εἰσιν πρὸς πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος Ισραηλ τὸ ἐκλεῖπον καὶ ἀποστελοῦμεν ἐκεῖ καὶ ὀψόμεθα
14 καὶ ἔλαβον δύο ἐπιβάτας ἵππων καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ ὀπίσω τοῦ βασιλέως Συρίας λέγων δεῦτε καὶ ἴδετε
15 καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἕως τοῦ Ιορδάνου καὶ ἰδοὺ πᾶσα ἡ ὁδὸς πλήρης ἱματίων καὶ σκευῶν ὧν ἔρριψεν Συρία ἐν τῷ θαμβεῖσθαι αὐτούς καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν οἱ ἄγγελοι καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ βασιλεῖ

16 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ διήρπασεν τὴν παρεμβολὴν Συρίας καὶ ἐγένετο μέτρον σεμιδάλεως σίκλου καὶ δίμετρον κριθῶν σίκλου κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου
17 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς κατέστησεν τὸν τριστάτην ἐ{F'} ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπανεπαύετο ἐπὶ τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς πύλης καὶ συνεπάτησεν αὐτὸν ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ πύλῃ καὶ ἀπέθανεν καθὰ ἐλάλησεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ὃς ἐλάλησεν ἐν τῷ καταβῆναι τὸν ἄγγελον πρὸς αὐτόν
18 καὶ ἐγένετο καθὰ ἐλάλησεν Ελισαιε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα λέγων Δίμετρον κριθῆς σίκλου καὶ μέτρον σεμιδάλεως σίκλου καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἡ ὥρα αὕτη αὔριον ἐν τῇ πύλῃ Σαμαρείας
19 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ τριστάτης τῷ Ελισαιε καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ κύριος ποιεῖ καταρράκτας ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ μὴ ἔσται τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε ἰδοὺ ὄψῃ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου καὶ ἐκεῖθεν οὐ φάγῃ
20 καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως καὶ συνεπάτησεν αὐτὸν ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ πύλῃ καὶ ἀπέθανεν
