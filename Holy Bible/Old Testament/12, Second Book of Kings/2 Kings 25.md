# Second Book of Kings 25 (RSVCE)

1 And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezʹzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it; and they built siegeworks against it round about.
2 So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiʹah.
3 On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
4 Then a breach was made in the city; the king with all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, by the king’s garden, though the Chaldeʹans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah.
5 But the army of the Chaldeʹans pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
6 Then they captured the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, who passed sentence upon him.
7 They slew the sons of Zedekiʹah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiʹah, and bound him in fetters, and took him to Babylon.
8 In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month—which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezʹzar, king of Babylon—Nebuʹzaradʹan, the captain of the bodyguard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
9 And he burned the house of theLord, and the king’s house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
10 And all the army of the Chaldeʹans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
11 And the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the multitude, Nebuʹzaradʹan the captain of the guard carried into exile.
12 But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
13 And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of theLord, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of theLord, the Chaldeʹans broke in pieces, and carried the bronze to Babylon.
14 And they took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service,
15 the firepans also, and the bowls. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver.
16 As for the two pillars, the one sea, and the stands, which Solomon had made for the house of theLord, the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.
17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and upon it was a capital of bronze; the height of the capital was three cubits; a network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were upon the capital round about. And the second pillar had the like, with the network.
18 And the captain of the guard took Seraiʹah the chief priest, and Zephaniʹah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;
19 and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and five men of the king’s council who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.
20 And Nebuʹzaradʹan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
21 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land.
### Gedaliah Made Governor of Judah
22 And over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezʹzar king of Babylon had left, he appointed Gedaliʹah the son of Ahiʹkam, son of Shaphan, governor.
23 Now when all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliʹah governor, they came with their men to Gedaliʹah at Mizpah, namely, Ishʹmael the son of Nethaniʹah, and Johaʹnan the son of Kareʹah, and Seraiʹah the son of Tanʹhumeth the Netophʹathite, and Ja-azaniʹah the son of the Ma-acʹathite.
24 And Gedaliʹah swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid because of the Chaldeʹan officials; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.”
25 But in the seventh month, Ishʹmael the son of Nethaniʹah, son of Elishʹama, of the royal family, came with ten men, and attacked and killed Gedaliʹah and the Jews and the Chaldeʹans who were with him at Mizpah.
26 Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose, and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeʹans.
### Jehoiachin Released from Prison
27 And in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiʹachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evil-merʹodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, graciously freed Jehoiʹachin king of Judah from prison;
28 and he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
29 So Jehoiʹachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king’s table;
30 and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, every day a portion, as long as he lived.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 25 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem anno nono regni ejus, mense decimo, decima die mensis, venit Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis, ipse et omnis exercitus ejus, in Jerusalem, et circumdederunt eam: et exstruxerunt in circuitu ejus munitiones.
2 Et clausa est civitas atque vallata usque ad undecimum annum regis Sedeciæ,
3 nona die mensis: prævaluitque fames in civitate, nec erat panis populo terræ.
4 Et interrupta est civitas: et omnes viri bellatores nocte fugerunt per viam portæ quæ est inter duplicem murum ad hortum regis. Porro Chaldæi obsidebant in circuitu civitatem. Fugit itaque Sedecias per viam quæ ducit ad campestria solitudinis.
5 Et persecutus est exercitus Chaldæorum regem, comprehenditque eum in planitie Jericho: et omnes bellatores qui erant cum eo, dispersi sunt, et reliquerunt eum.
6 Apprehensum ergo regem duxerunt ad regem Babylonis in Reblatha: qui locutus est cum eo judicium.
7 Filios autem Sedeciæ occidit coram eo, et oculos ejus effodit, vinxitque eum catenis, et adduxit in Babylonem.

8 Mense quinto, septima die mensis, ipse est annus nonusdecimus regis Babylonis, venit Nabuzardan princeps exercitus, servus regis Babylonis, in Jerusalem.
9 Et succendit domum Domini, et domum regis: et domos Jerusalem, omnemque domum combussit igni.
10 Et muros Jerusalem in circuitu destruxit omnis exercitus Chaldæorum, qui erat cum principe militum.
11 Reliquam autem populi partem quæ remanserat in civitate, et perfugas qui transfugerant ad regem Babylonis, et reliquum vulgus transtulit Nabuzardan princeps militiæ.
12 Et de pauperibus terræ reliquit vinitores et agricolas.
13 Columnas autem æreas quæ erant in templo Domini, et bases, et mare æreum quod erat in domo Domini, confregerunt Chaldæi, et transtulerunt æs omne in Babylonem.
14 Ollas quoque æreas, et trullas, et tridentes, et scyphos, et mortariola, et omnia vasa ærea, in quibus ministrabant, tulerunt.
15 Necnon et thuribula, et phialas: quæ aurea, aurea, et quæ argentea, argentea tulit princeps militiæ,
16 id est, columnas duas, mare unum, et bases quas fecerat Salomon in templo Domini: non erat pondus æris omnium vasorum.
17 Decem et octo cubitos altitudinis habebat columna una: et capitellum æreum super se altitudinis trium cubitorum: et retiaculum, et malogranata super capitellum columnæ, omnia ærea: similem et columna secunda habebat ornatum.

18 Tulit quoque princeps militiæ Saraiam sacerdotem primum, et Sophoniam sacerdotem secundum, et tres janitores.
19 Et de civitate eunuchum unum, qui erat præfectus super bellatores viros: et quinque viros de his qui steterant coram rege, quos reperit in civitate: et Sopher principem exercitus, qui probabat tyrones de populo terræ: et sexaginta viros e vulgo, qui inventi fuerant in civitate.
20 Quos tollens Nabuzardan princeps militum, duxit ad regem Babylonis in Reblatha.
21 Percussitque eos rex Babylonis, et interfecit eos in Reblatha in terra Emath: et translatus est Juda de terra sua.
22 Populo autem qui relictus erat in terra Juda, quem dimiserat Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis, præfecit Godoliam filium Ahicam filii Saphan.
23 Quod cum audissent omnes duces militum, ipsi et viri qui erant cum eis, videlicet quod constituisset rex Babylonis Godoliam, venerunt ad Godoliam in Maspha, Ismahel filius Nathaniæ, et Johanan filius Caree, et Saraia filius Thanehumeth Netophathites, et Jezonias filius Maachathi, ipsi et socii eorum.
24 Juravitque Godolias ipsis et sociis eorum, dicens: Nolite timere servire Chaldæis: manete in terra, et servite regi Babylonis, et bene erit vobis.
25 Factum est autem in mense septimo, venit Ismahel filius Nathaniæ filii Elisama de semine regio, et decem viri cum eo: percusseruntque Godoliam, qui et mortuus est: sed et Judæos et Chaldæos qui erant cum eo in Maspha.
26 Consurgensque omnis populus a parvo usque ad magnum, et principes militum, venerunt in Ægyptum timentes Chaldæos.

27 Factum est vero in anno trigesimo septimo transmigrationis Joachin regis Juda, mense duodecimo, vigesima septima die mensis: sublevavit Evilmerodach rex Babylonis, anno quo regnare cœperat, caput Joachin regis Juda de carcere.
28 Et locutus est ei benigne, et posuit thronum ejus super thronum regum qui erant cum eo in Babylone.
29 Et mutavit vestes ejus quas habuerat in carcere, et comedebat panem semper in conspectu ejus cunctis diebus vitæ suæ.
30 Annonam quoque constituit ei sine intermissione, quæ et dabatur ei a rege per singulos dies omnibus diebus vitæ suæ.
