# Second Book of Kings 24 (RSVCE)

### Judah Overrun by Enemies
1 In his days Nebuchadnezʹzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiʹakim became his servant three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.
2 And theLordsent against him bands of the Chaldeʹans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the Ammonites, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of theLordwhich he spoke by his servants the prophets.
3 Surely this came upon Judah at the command of theLord, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasʹseh, according to all that he had done,
4 and also for the innocent blood that he had shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and theLordwould not pardon.
5 Now the rest of the deeds of Jehoiʹakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
6 So Jehoiʹakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiʹachin his son reigned in his stead.
7 And the king of Egypt did not come again out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of Egypt to the river Euphraʹtes.
### Reign and Captivity of Jehoiachin
8 Jehoiʹachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Nehushʹta the daughter of Elnaʹthan of Jerusalem.
9 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord, according to all that his father had done.
### Capture of Jerusalem
10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezʹzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
11 And Nebuchadnezʹzar king of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it;
12 and Jehoiʹachin the king of Judah gave himself up to the king of Babylon, himself, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his palace officials. The king of Babylon took him prisoner in the eighth year of his reign,
13 and carried off all the treasures of the house of theLord, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold in the temple of theLord, which Solomon king of Israel had made, as theLordhad foretold.
14 He carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, except the poorest people of the land.
15 And he carried away Jehoiʹachin to Babylon; the king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officials, and the chief men of the land, he took into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
16 And the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon all the men of valor, seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths, one thousand, all of them strong and fit for war.
17 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniʹah, Jehoiʹachin’s uncle, king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiʹah.
### Zedekiah Reigns over Judah
18 Zedekiʹah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamuʹtal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
19 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord, according to all that Jehoiʹakim had done.
### The Fall and Captivity of Judah
20 For because of the anger of theLordit came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiʹah rebelled against the king of Babylon.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 24 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In diebus ejus ascendit Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis, et factus est ei Joakim servus tribus annis: et rursum rebellavit contra eum.
2 Immisitque ei Dominus latrunculos Chaldæorum, et latrunculos Syriæ, et latrunculos Moab, et latrunculos filiorum Ammon: et immisit eos in Judam ut disperderent eum, juxta verbum Domini quod locutus fuerat per servos suos prophetas.
3 Factum est autem hoc per verbum Domini contra Judam, ut auferret eum coram se propter peccata Manasse universa quæ fecit,
4 et propter sanguinem innoxium quem effudit, et implevit Jerusalem cruore innocentium: et ob hanc rem noluit Dominus propitiari.
5 Reliqua autem sermonum Joakim, et universa quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Juda? Et dormivit Joakim cum patribus suis:
6 et regnavit Joachin filius ejus pro eo.
7 Et ultra non addidit rex Ægypti ut egrederetur de terra sua: tulerat enim rex Babylonis, a rivo Ægypti usque ad fluvium Euphraten, omnia quæ fuerant regis Ægypti.

8 Decem et octo annorum erat Joachin cum regnare cœpisset, et tribus mensibus regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Nohesta filia Elnathan de Jerusalem.
9 Et fecit malum coram Domino, juxta omnia quæ fecerat pater ejus.
10 In tempore illo ascenderunt servi Nabuchodonosor regis Babylonis in Jerusalem, et circumdata est urbs munitionibus.
11 Venitque Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis ad civitatem cum servis suis ut oppugnarent eam.
12 Egressusque est Joachin rex Juda ad regem Babylonis, ipse et mater ejus, et servi ejus, et principes ejus, et eunuchi ejus: et suscepit eum rex Babylonis anno octavo regni sui.
13 Et protulit inde omnes thesauros domus Domini, et thesauros domus regiæ: et concidit universa vasa aurea quæ fecerat Salomon rex Israël in templo Domini juxta verbum Domini.
14 Et transtulit omnem Jerusalem, et universos principes, et omnes fortes exercitus, decem millia, in captivitatem, et omnem artificem et clusorem: nihilque relictum est, exceptis pauperibus populi terræ.
15 Transtulit quoque Joachin in Babylonem, et matrem regis, et uxores regis, et eunuchos ejus: et judices terræ duxit in captivitatem de Jerusalem in Babylonem.
16 Et omnes viros robustos, septem millia, et artifices, et clusores mille, omnes viros fortes et bellatores: duxitque eos rex Babylonis captivos in Babylonem.
17 Et constituit Matthaniam patruum ejus pro eo: imposuitque nomen ei Sedeciam.

18 Vigesimum et primum annum ætatis habebat Sedecias cum regnare cœpisset, et undecim annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus erat Amital filia Jeremiæ de Lobna.
19 Et fecit malum coram Domino, juxta omnia quæ fecerat Joakim.
20 Irascebatur enim Dominus contra Jerusalem et contra Judam, donec projiceret eos a facie sua: recessitque Sedecias a rege Babylonis.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 24 (Septuagint)

1 ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἀνέβη Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ Ιωακιμ δοῦλος τρία ἔτη καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν καὶ ἠθέτησεν ἐν αὐτῷ
2 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ τοὺς μονοζώνους τῶν Χαλδαίων καὶ τοὺς μονοζώνους Συρίας καὶ τοὺς μονοζώνους Μωαβ καὶ τοὺς μονοζώνους υἱῶν Αμμων καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ γῇ Ιουδα τοῦ κατισχῦσαι κατὰ τὸν λόγον κυρίου ὃν ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ τῶν προφητῶν
3 πλὴν ἐπὶ τὸν θυμὸν κυρίου ἦν ἐν τῷ Ιουδα ἀποστῆσαι αὐτὸν ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἐν ἁμαρτίαις Μανασση κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν
4 καί γε αἷμα ἀθῷον ἐξέχεεν καὶ ἔπλησεν τὴν Ιερουσαλημ αἵματος ἀθῴου καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν κύριος ἱλασθῆναι
5 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ιωακιμ καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ιουδα
6 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ιωακιμ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωακιμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
7 καὶ οὐ προσέθετο ἔτι βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου ἐξελθεῖν ἐκ τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἔλαβεν βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἀπὸ τοῦ χειμάρρου Αἰγύπτου ἕως τοῦ ποταμοῦ Εὐφράτου πάντα ὅσα ἦν τοῦ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου

8 υἱὸς ὀκτωκαίδεκα ἐτῶν Ιωακιμ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ τρίμηνον ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Νεσθα θυγάτηρ Ελλαναθαν ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ
9 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ
10 ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀνέβη Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἦλθεν ἡ πόλις ἐν περιοχῇ
11 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἐπολιόρκουν ἐ{P'} αὐτήν
12 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ιωακιμ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα ἐπὶ βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ εὐνοῦχοι αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐν ἔτει ὀγδόῳ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ ἐξήνεγκεν ἐκεῖθεν πάντας τοὺς θησαυροὺς οἴκου κυρίου καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ συνέκοψεν πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ ἃ ἐποίησεν Σαλωμων βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ ἐν τῷ ναῷ κυρίου κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου
14 καὶ ἀπῴκισεν τὴν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ τοὺς δυνατοὺς ἰσχύι αἰχμαλωσίας δέκα χιλιάδας αἰχμαλωτίσας καὶ πᾶν τέκτονα καὶ τὸν συγκλείοντα καὶ οὐχ ὑπελείφθη πλὴν οἱ πτωχοὶ τῆς γῆς
15 καὶ ἀπῴκισεν τὸν Ιωακιμ εἰς Βαβυλῶνα καὶ τὴν μητέρα τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τοὺς εὐνούχους αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἰσχυροὺς τῆς γῆς ἀπήγαγεν ἀποικεσίαν ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ εἰς Βαβυλῶνα
16 καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς δυνάμεως ἑπτακισχιλίους καὶ τὸν τέκτονα καὶ τὸν συγκλείοντα χιλίους πάντες δυνατοὶ ποιοῦντες πόλεμον καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτοὺς βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος μετοικεσίαν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα
17 καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος τὸν Μαθθανιαν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέθηκεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Σεδεκια

18 υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ ἑνὸς ἐνιαυτοῦ Σεδεκιας ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ ἕνδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Αμιταλ θυγάτηρ Ιερεμιου
19 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον κυρίου κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ιωακιμ
20 ὅτι ἐπὶ τὸν θυμὸν κυρίου ἦν ἐπὶ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐν τῷ Ιουδα ἕως ἀπέρριψεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἠθέτησεν Σεδεκιας ἐν τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος
