# Second Book of Kings 6 (RSVCE)

### The Miracle of the Ax Head
1 Now the sons of the prophets said to Eliʹsha, “See, the place where we dwell under your charge is too small for us.
2 Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get there a log, and let us make a place for us to dwell there.” And he answered, “Go.”
3 Then one of them said, “Be pleased to go with your servants.” And he answered, “I will go.”
4 So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.
5 But as one was felling a log, his axe head fell into the water; and he cried out, “Alas, my master! It was borrowed.”
6 Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick, and threw it in there, and made the iron float.
7 And he said, “Take it up.” So he reached out his hand and took it.
### The Aramean Attack Is Thwarted
8 Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servants, saying, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.”
9 But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are going down there.”
10 And the king of Israel sent to the place of which the man of God told him. Thus he used to warn him, so that he saved himself there more than once or twice.
11 And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not show me who of us is for the king of Israel?”
12 And one of his servants said, “None, my lord, O king; but Eliʹsha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.”
13 And he said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him.” It was told him, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”
14 So he sent there horses and chariots and a great army; and they came by night, and surrounded the city.
15 When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was round about the city. And the servant said, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”
16 He said, “Fear not, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”
17 Then Eliʹsha prayed, and said, “OLord, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may see.” So theLordopened the eyes of the young man, and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Eliʹsha.
18 And when the Syrians came down against him, Eliʹsha prayed to theLord, and said, “Strike this people, I pray thee, with blindness.” So he struck them with blindness in accordance with the prayer of Eliʹsha.
19 And Eliʹsha said to them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he led them to Samarʹia.
20 As soon as they entered Samarʹia, Eliʹsha said, “OLord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.” So theLordopened their eyes, and they saw; and lo, they were in the midst of Samarʹia.
21 When the king of Israel saw them he said to Eliʹsha, “My father, shall I slay them? Shall I slay them?”
22 He answered, “You shall not slay them. Would you slay those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.”
23 So he prepared for them a great feast; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the Syrians came no more on raids into the land of Israel.
### Ben-hadad’s Siege of Samaria
24 Afterward Ben-haʹdad king of Syria mustered his entire army, and went up, and besieged Samarʹia.
25 And there was a great famine in Samarʹia, as they besieged it, until an ass’s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung for five shekels of silver.
26 Now as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”
27 And he said, “If theLordwill not help you, whence shall I help you? From the threshing floor, or from the wine press?”
28 And the king asked her, “What is your trouble?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’
29 So we boiled my son, and ate him. And on the next day I said to her, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him’; but she has hidden her son.”
30 When the king heard the words of the woman he rent his clothes—now he was passing by upon the wall—and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath upon his body—
31 and he said, “May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Eliʹsha the son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today.”
32 Eliʹsha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Now the king had dispatched a man from his presence; but before the messenger arrived Eliʹsha said to the elders, “Do you see how this murderer has sent to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him. Is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”
33 And while he was still speaking with them, the king came down to him and said, “This trouble is from theLord! Why should I wait for theLordany longer?”


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 6 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dixerunt autem filii prophetarum ad Eliseum: Ecce locus in quo habitamus coram te, angustus est nobis.
2 Eamus usque ad Jordanem, et tollant singuli de silva materias singulas, ut ædificemus nobis ibi locum ad habitandum. Qui dixit: Ite.
3 Et ait unus ex illis: Veni ergo et tu cum servis tuis. Respondit: Ego veniam.
4 Et abiit cum eis. Cumque venissent ad Jordanem, cædebant ligna.
5 Accidit autem ut cum unus materiam succidisset, caderet ferrum securis in aquam: exclamavitque ille, et ait: Heu! heu! heu! domine mi: et hoc ipsum mutuo acceperam.
6 Dixit autem homo Dei: Ubi cecidit? At ille monstravit ei locum. Præcidit ergo lignum, et misit illuc: natavitque ferrum,
7 et ait: Tolle. Qui extendit manum, et tulit illud.

8 Rex autem Syriæ pugnabat contra Israël, consiliumque iniit cum servis suis, dicens: In loco illo et illo ponamus insidias.
9 Misit itaque vir Dei ad regem Israël, dicens: Cave ne transeas in locum illum: quia ibi Syri in insidiis sunt.
10 Misit itaque rex Israël ad locum quem dixerat ei vir Dei, et præoccupavit eum, et observavit se ibi non semel neque bis.
11 Conturbatumque est cor regis Syriæ pro hac re: et convocatis servis suis, ait: Quare non indicatis mihi quis proditor mei sit apud regem Israël?
12 Dixitque unus servorum ejus: Nequaquam, domine mi rex, sed Eliseus propheta qui est in Israël, indicat regi Israël omnia verba quæcumque locutus fueris in conclavi tuo.
13 Dixitque eis: Ite, et videte ubi sit, ut mittam, et capiam eum. Annuntiaveruntque ei, dicentes: Ecce in Dothan.
14 Misit ergo illuc equos et currus, et robur exercitus: qui cum venissent nocte, circumdederunt civitatem.

15 Consurgens autem diluculo minister viri Dei, egressus vidit exercitum in circuitu civitatis, et equos et currus: nuntiavitque ei, dicens: Heu! heu! heu! domine mi: quid faciemus?
16 At ille respondit: Noli timere: plures enim nobiscum sunt, quam cum illis.
17 Cumque orasset Eliseus, ait: Domine, aperi oculos hujus, ut videat. Et aperuit Dominus oculos pueri, et vidit: et ecce mons plenus equorum et curruum igneorum in circuitu Elisei.
18 Hostes vero descenderunt ad eum: porro Eliseus oravit ad Dominum, dicens: Percute, obsecro, gentem hanc cæcitate. Percussitque eos Dominus ne viderent, juxta verbum Elisei.
19 Dixit autem ad eos Eliseus: Non est hæc via, neque ista est civitas: sequimini me, et ostendam vobis virum quem quæritis. Duxit ergo eos in Samariam:
20 cumque ingressi fuissent in Samariam, dixit Eliseus: Domine, aperi oculos istorum, ut videant. Aperuitque Dominus oculos eorum, et viderunt se esse in medio Samariæ.
21 Dixitque rex Israël ad Eliseum, cum vidisset eos: Numquid percutiam eos, pater mi?
22 At ille ait: Non percuties: neque enim cepisti eos gladio et arcu tuo, ut percutias: sed pone panem et aquam coram eis, ut comedant et bibant, et vadant ad dominum suum.
23 Appositaque est eis ciborum magna præparatio, et comederunt et biberunt, et dimisit eos, abieruntque ad dominum suum, et ultra non venerunt latrones Syriæ in terram Israël.

24 Factum est autem post hæc, congregavit Benadad rex Syriæ universum exercitum suum, et ascendit, et obsidebat Samariam.
25 Factaque est fames magna in Samaria: et tamdiu obsessa est, donec venundaretur caput asini octoginta argenteis, et quarta pars cabi stercoris columbarum quinque argenteis.
26 Cumque rex Israël transiret per murum, mulier quædam exclamavit ad eum, dicens: Salva me, domine mi rex.
27 Qui ait: Non te salvat Dominus: unde te possum salvare? de area, vel de torculari? Dixitque ad eam rex: Quid tibi vis? Quæ respondit:
28 Mulier ista dixit mihi: Da filium tuum, ut comedamus eum hodie, et filium meum comedemus cras.
29 Coximus ergo filium meum, et comedimus. Dixique ei die altera: Da filium tuum, ut comedamus eum. Quæ abscondit filium suum.
30 Quod cum audisset rex, scidit vestimenta sua, et transibat per murum. Viditque omnis populus cilicium quo vestitus erat ad carnem intrinsecus.
31 Et ait rex: Hæc mihi faciat Deus, et hæc addat, si steterit caput Elisei filii Saphat super ipsum hodie.

32 Eliseus autem sedebat in domo sua, et senes sedebant cum eo. Præmisit itaque virum: et antequam veniret nuntius ille, dixit ad senes: Numquid scitis quod miserit filius homicidæ hic, ut præcidatur caput meum? videte ergo: cum venerit nuntius, claudite ostium, et non sinatis eum introire: ecce enim sonitus pedum domini ejus post eum est.
33 Adhuc illo loquente eis, apparuit nuntius qui veniebat ad eum. Et ait: Ecce, tantum malum a Domino est: quid amplius expectabo a Domino?

1 καὶ εἶπον οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν πρὸς Ελισαιε ἰδοὺ δὴ ὁ τόπος ἐν ᾧ ἡμεῖς οἰκοῦμεν ἐνώπιόν σου στενὸς ἀ{F'} ἡμῶν
2 πορευθῶμεν δὴ ἕως τοῦ Ιορδάνου καὶ λάβωμεν ἐκεῖθεν ἀνὴρ εἷς δοκὸν μίαν καὶ ποιήσωμεν ἑαυτοῖς ἐκεῖ τοῦ οἰκεῖν ἐκεῖ καὶ εἶπεν δεῦτε
3 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ εἷς ἐπιεικέως δεῦρο μετὰ τῶν δούλων σου καὶ εἶπεν ἐγὼ πορεύσομαι
4 καὶ ἐπορεύθη με{T'} αὐτῶν καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὸν Ιορδάνην καὶ ἔτεμνον τὰ ξύλα
5 καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ εἷς καταβάλλων τὴν δοκόν καὶ τὸ σιδήριον ἐξέπεσεν εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ ἐβόησεν ὦ κύριε καὶ αὐτὸ κεχρημένον
6 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ποῦ ἔπεσεν καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ τὸν τόπον καὶ ἀπέκνισεν ξύλον καὶ ἔρριψεν ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐπεπόλασεν τὸ σιδήριον
7 καὶ εἶπεν ὕψωσον σαυτῷ καὶ ἐξέτεινεν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτό

8 καὶ βασιλεὺς Συρίας ἦν πολεμῶν ἐν Ισραηλ καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ λέγων εἰς τὸν τόπον τόνδε τινὰ ελμωνι παρεμβαλῶ
9 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ελισαιε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ισραηλ λέγων φύλαξαι μὴ παρελθεῖν ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ ὅτι ἐκεῖ Συρία κέκρυπται
10 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ελισαιε καὶ ἐφυλάξατο ἐκεῖθεν οὐ μίαν οὐδὲ δύο
11 καὶ ἐξεκινήθη ἡ ψυχὴ βασιλέως Συρίας περὶ τοῦ λόγου τούτου καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς οὐκ ἀναγγελεῖτέ μοι τίς προδίδωσίν με βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ
12 καὶ εἶπεν εἷς τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ οὐχί κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ ὅτι Ελισαιε ὁ προφήτης ὁ ἐν Ισραηλ ἀναγγέλλει τῷ βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ πάντας τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἐὰν λαλήσῃς ἐν τῷ ταμιείῳ τοῦ κοιτῶνός σου
13 καὶ εἶπεν δεῦτε ἴδετε ποῦ οὗτος καὶ ἀποστείλας λήμψομαι αὐτόν καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες ἰδοὺ ἐν Δωθαϊμ
14 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἐκεῖ ἵππον καὶ ἅρμα καὶ δύναμιν βαρεῖαν καὶ ἦλθον νυκτὸς καὶ περιεκύκλωσαν τὴν πόλιν

15 καὶ ὤρθρισεν ὁ λειτουργὸς Ελισαιε ἀναστῆναι καὶ ἐξῆλθεν καὶ ἰδοὺ δύναμις κυκλοῦσα τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἵππος καὶ ἅρμα καὶ εἶπεν τὸ παιδάριον πρὸς αὐτόν ὦ κύριε πῶς ποιήσωμεν
16 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε μὴ φοβοῦ ὅτι πλείους οἱ με{Q'} ἡμῶν ὑπὲρ τοὺς με{T'} αὐτῶν
17 καὶ προσεύξατο Ελισαιε καὶ εἶπεν κύριε διάνοιξον τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς τοῦ παιδαρίου καὶ ἰδέτω καὶ διήνοιξεν κύριος τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶδεν καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ ὄρος πλῆρες ἵππων καὶ ἅρμα πυρὸς περικύκλῳ Ελισαιε
18 καὶ κατέβησαν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ προσηύξατο Ελισαιε πρὸς κύριον καὶ εἶπεν πάταξον δὴ τοῦτο τὸ ἔθνος ἀορασίᾳ καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς ἀορασίᾳ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ελισαιε
19 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ελισαιε οὐχ αὕτη ἡ πόλις καὶ αὕτη ἡ ὁδός δεῦτε ὀπίσω μου καὶ ἀπάξω ὑμᾶς πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα ὃν ζητεῖτε καὶ ἀπήγαγεν αὐτοὺς εἰς Σαμάρειαν
20 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἰσῆλθον εἰς Σαμάρειαν καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε ἄνοιξον δή κύριε τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ ἰδέτωσαν καὶ διήνοιξεν κύριος τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ εἶδον καὶ ἰδοὺ ἦσαν ἐν μέσῳ Σαμαρείας
21 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ ὡς εἶδεν αὐτούς εἰ πατάξας πατάξω πάτερ
22 καὶ εἶπεν οὐ πατάξεις εἰ μὴ οὓς ᾐχμαλώτευσας ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ σου καὶ τόξῳ σου σὺ τύπτεις παράθες ἄρτους καὶ ὕδωρ ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν καὶ φαγέτωσαν καὶ πιέτωσαν καὶ ἀπελθέτωσαν πρὸς τὸν κύριον αὐτῶν
23 καὶ παρέθηκεν αὐτοῖς παράθεσιν μεγάλην καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἔπιον καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτούς καὶ ἀπῆλθον πρὸς τὸν κύριον αὐτῶν καὶ οὐ προσέθεντο ἔτι μονόζωνοι Συρίας τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς γῆν Ισραηλ

24 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἤθροισεν υἱὸς Αδερ βασιλεὺς Συρίας πᾶσαν τὴν παρεμβολὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέβη καὶ περιεκάθισεν Σαμάρειαν
25 καὶ ἐγένετο λιμὸς μέγας ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ ἰδοὺ περιεκάθηντο ἐ{P'} αὐτήν ἕως οὗ ἐγενήθη κεφαλὴ ὄνου πεντήκοντα σίκλων ἀργυρίου καὶ τέταρτον τοῦ κάβου κόπρου περιστερῶν πέντε σίκλων ἀργυρίου
26 καὶ ἦν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ διαπορευόμενος ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους καὶ γυνὴ ἐβόησεν πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγουσα σῶσον κύριε βασιλεῦ
27 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ μή σε σώσαι κύριος πόθεν σώσω σε μὴ ἀπὸ τῆς ἅλωνος ἢ ἀπὸ τῆς ληνοῦ
28 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ βασιλεύς τί ἐστίν σοι καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ αὕτη εἶπεν πρός με δὸς τὸν υἱόν σου καὶ φαγόμεθα αὐτὸν σήμερον καὶ τὸν υἱόν μου καὶ φαγόμεθα αὐτὸν αὔριον
29 καὶ ἡψήσαμεν τὸν υἱόν μου καὶ ἐφάγομεν αὐτόν καὶ εἶπον πρὸς αὐτὴν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ δὸς τὸν υἱόν σου καὶ φάγωμεν αὐτόν καὶ ἔκρυψεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς
30 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ τοὺς λόγους τῆς γυναικός διέρρηξεν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς διεπορεύετο ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους καὶ εἶδεν ὁ λαὸς τὸν σάκκον ἐπὶ τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ ἔσωθεν
31 καὶ εἶπεν τάδε ποιήσαι μοι ὁ θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη εἰ στήσεται ἡ κεφαλὴ Ελισαιε ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ σήμερον

32 καὶ Ελισαιε ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ἐκάθηντο με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἄνδρα πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ πρὶν ἐλθεῖν τὸν ἄγγελον πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ αὐτὸς εἶπεν πρὸς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους εἰ οἴδατε ὅτι ἀπέστειλεν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ φονευτοῦ οὗτος ἀφελεῖν τὴν κεφαλήν μου ἴδετε ὡς ἂν ἔλθῃ ὁ ἄγγελος ἀποκλείσατε τὴν θύραν καὶ παραθλίψατε αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ θύρᾳ οὐχὶ φωνὴ τῶν ποδῶν τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ κατόπισθεν αὐτοῦ
33 ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος με{T'} αὐτῶν καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄγγελος κατέβη πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ αὕτη ἡ κακία παρὰ κυρίου τί ὑπομείνω τῷ κυρίῳ ἔτι
