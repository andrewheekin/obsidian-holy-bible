# Second Book of Kings 17 (RSVCE)

### Hoshea Reigns over Israel; Israel Carried Captive to Assyria
1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah Hosheʹa the son of Elah began to reign in Samarʹia over Israel, and he reigned nine years.
2 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him.
3 Against him came up Shalmaneʹser king of Assyria; and Hosheʹa became his vassal, and paid him tribute.
4 But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hosheʹa; for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year; therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
5 Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samarʹia, and for three years he besieged it.
6 In the ninth year of Hosheʹa the king of Assyria captured Samarʹia, and he carried the Israelites away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
7 And this was so, because the people of Israel had sinned against theLordtheir God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods
8 and walked in the customs of the nations whom theLorddrove out before the people of Israel, and in the customs which the kings of Israel had introduced.
9 And the people of Israel did secretly against theLordtheir God things that were not right. They built for themselves high places at all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city;
10 they set up for themselves pillars and Asheʹrim on every high hill and under every green tree;
11 and there they burned incense on all the high places, as the nations did whom theLordcarried away before them. And they did wicked things, provoking theLordto anger,
12 and they served idols, of which theLordhad said to them, “You shall not do this.”
13 Yet theLordwarned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.”
14 But they would not listen, but were stubborn, as their fathers had been, who did not believe in theLordtheir God.
15 They despised his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and the warnings which he gave them. They went after false idols, and became false, and they followed the nations that were round about them, concerning whom theLordhad commanded them that they should not do like them.
16 And they forsook all the commandments of theLordtheir God, and made for themselves molten images of two calves; and they made an Asheʹrah, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baʹal.
17 And they burned their sons and their daughters as offerings, and used divination and sorcery, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of theLord, provoking him to anger.
18 Therefore theLordwas very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight; none was left but the tribe of Judah only.
19 Judah also did not keep the commandments of theLordtheir God, but walked in the customs which Israel had introduced.
20 And theLordrejected all the descendants of Israel, and afflicted them, and gave them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
21 When he had torn Israel from the house of David they made Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat king. And Jeroboʹam drove Israel from following theLordand made them commit great sin.
22 The people of Israel walked in all the sins which Jeroboʹam did; they did not depart from them,
23 until theLordremoved Israel out of his sight, as he had spoken by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their own land to Assyria until this day.
### Assyria Resettles Samaria
24 And the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaʹim, and placed them in the cities of Samarʹia instead of the people of Israel; and they took possession of Samarʹia, and dwelt in its cities.
25 And at the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear theLord; therefore theLordsent lions among them, which killed some of them.
26 So the king of Assyria was told, “The nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samarʹia do not know the law of the god of the land; therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them, because they do not know the law of the god of the land.”
27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, “Send there one of the priests whom you carried away thence; and let him go and dwell there, and teach them the law of the god of the land.”
28 So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samarʹia came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear theLord.
29 But every nation still made gods of its own, and put them in the shrines of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in the cities in which they dwelt;
30 the men of Babylon made Sucʹcoth-beʹnoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashiʹma,
31 and the Avʹvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharʹvites burned their children in the fire to Adramʹmelech and Anamʹmelech, the gods of Sepharvaʹim.
32 They also feared theLord, and appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places.
33 So they feared theLordbut also served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
34 To this day they do according to the former manner. They do not fear theLord, and they do not follow the statutes or the ordinances or the law or the commandment which theLordcommanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
35 TheLordmade a covenant with them, and commanded them, “You shall not fear other gods or bow yourselves to them or serve them or sacrifice to them;
36 but you shall fear theLord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm; you shall bow yourselves to him, and to him you shall sacrifice.
37 And the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you, you shall always be careful to do. You shall not fear other gods,
38 and you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods,
39 but you shall fear theLordyour God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.”
40 However they would not listen, but they did according to their former manner.
41 So these nations feared theLord, and also served their graven images; their children likewise, and their children’s children—as their fathers did, so they do to this day.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 17 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno duodecimo Achaz regis Juda, regnavit Osee filius Ela in Samaria super Israël novem annis.
2 Fecitque malum coram Domino, sed non sicut reges Israël qui ante eum fuerant.
3 Contra hunc ascendit Salmanasar rex Assyriorum, et factus est ei Osee servus, reddebatque illi tributa.
4 Cumque deprehendisset rex Assyriorum Osee, quod rebellare nitens misisset nuntios ad Sua regem Ægypti ne præstaret tributa regi Assyriorum sicut singulis annis solitus erat, obsedit eum, et vinctum misit in carcerem.
5 Pervagatusque est omnem terram: et ascendens Samariam, obsedit eam tribus annis.
6 Anno autem nono Osee, cepit rex Assyriorum Samariam, et transtulit Israël in Assyrios: posuitque eos in Hala et in Habor juxta fluvium Gozan, in civitatibus Medorum.

7 Factum est enim, cum peccassent filii Israël Domino Deo suo, qui eduxerat eos de terra Ægypti, de manu Pharaonis regis Ægypti, coluerunt deos alienos.
8 Et ambulaverunt juxta ritum gentium quas consumpserat Dominus in conspectu filiorum Israël et regum Israël, quia similiter fecerant.
9 Et offenderunt filii Israël verbis non rectis Dominum Deum suum: et ædificaverunt sibi excelsa in cunctis urbibus suis, a turre custodum usque ad civitatem munitam.
10 Feceruntque sibi statuas et lucos in omni colle sublimi, et subter omne lignum nemorosum:
11 et adolebant ibi incensum super aras in morem gentium quas transtulerat Dominus a facie eorum: feceruntque verba pessima irritantes Dominum.
12 Et coluerunt immunditias de quibus præcepit eis Dominus ne facerent verbum hoc.

13 Et testificatus est Dominus in Israël et in Juda per manum omnium prophetarum et videntium, dicens: Revertimini a viis vestris pessimis, et custodite præcepta mea et cæremonias, juxta omnem legem quam præcepi patribus vestris, et sicut misi ad vos in manu servorum meorum prophetarum.
14 Qui non audierunt, sed induraverunt cervicem suam juxta cervicem patrum suorum, qui noluerunt obedire Domino Deo suo.
15 Et abjecerunt legitima ejus, et pactum quod pepigit cum patribus eorum, et testificationes quibus contestatus est eos: secutique sunt vanitates, et vane egerunt: et secuti sunt gentes quæ erant per circuitum eorum, super quibus præceperat Dominus eis ut non facerent sicut et illæ faciebant.
16 Et dereliquerunt omnia præcepta Domini Dei sui: feceruntque sibi conflatiles duos vitulos, et lucos, et adoraverunt universam militiam cæli: servieruntque Baal,
17 et consecraverunt filios suos et filias suas per ignem: et divinationibus inserviebant, et auguriis: et tradiderunt se ut facerent malum coram Domino, ut irritarent eum.
18 Iratusque est Dominus vehementer Israëli, et abstulit eos a conspectu suo, et non remansit nisi tribus Juda tantummodo.
19 Sed nec ipse Juda custodivit mandata Domini Dei sui: verum ambulavit in erroribus Israël, quos operatus fuerat.
20 Projecitque Dominus omne semen Israël, et afflixit eos, et tradidit eos in manu diripientium, donec projiceret eos a facie sua:
21 ex eo jam tempore quo scissus est Israël a domo David, et constituerunt sibi regem Jeroboam filium Nabat: separavit enim Jeroboam Israël a Domino, et peccare eos fecit peccatum magnum.
22 Et ambulaverunt filii Israël in universis peccatis Jeroboam quæ fecerat: et non recesserunt ab eis,
23 usquequo Dominus auferret Israël a facie sua, sicut locutus fuerat in manu omnium servorum suorum prophetarum: translatusque est Israël de terra sua in Assyrios, usque in diem hanc.

24 Adduxit autem rex Assyriorum de Babylone, et de Cutha, et de Avah, et de Emath, et de Sepharvaim: et collocavit eos in civitatibus Samariæ pro filiis Israël: qui possederunt Samariam, et habitaverunt in urbibus ejus.
25 Cumque ibi habitare cœpissent, non timebant Dominum: et immisit in eos Dominus leones, qui interficiebant eos.
26 Nuntiatumque est regi Assyriorum, et dictum: Gentes quas transtulisti, et habitare fecisti in civitatibus Samariæ, ignorant legitima Dei terræ: et immisit in eos Dominus leones, et ecce interficiunt eos, eo quod ignorent ritum Dei terræ.
27 Præcepit autem rex Assyriorum, dicens: Ducite illuc unum de sacerdotibus quos inde captivos adduxistis, et vadat, et habitet cum eis: et doceat eos legitima Dei terræ.
28 Igitur cum venisset unus de sacerdotibus his qui captivi ducti fuerant de Samaria, habitavit in Bethel, et docebat eos quomodo colerent Dominum.
29 Et unaquæque gens fabricata est deum suum: posueruntque eos in fanis excelsis quæ fecerant Samaritæ, gens et gens in urbibus suis, in quibus habitabat.
30 Viri enim Babylonii fecerunt Sochothbenoth: viri autem Cuthæi fecerunt Nergel: et viri de Emath fecerunt Asima.
31 Porro Hevæi fecerunt Nebahaz et Tharthac. Hi autem qui erant de Sepharvaim, comburebant filios suos igni, Adramelech et Anamelech diis Sepharvaim,

32 et nihilominus colebant Dominum. Fecerunt autem sibi de novissimis sacerdotes excelsorum, et ponebant eos in fanis sublimibus.
33 Et cum Dominum colerent, diis quoque suis serviebant juxta consuetudinem gentium, de quibus translati fuerant Samariam.
34 Usque in præsentem diem morem sequuntur antiquum: non timent Dominum, neque custodiunt cæremonias ejus, judicia, et legem, et mandatum, quod præceperat Dominus filiis Jacob, quem cognominavit Israël:
35 et percusserat cum eis pactum, et mandaverat eis, dicens: Nolite timere deos alienos, et non adoretis eos, neque colatis eos, et non immoletis eis:
36 sed Dominum Deum vestrum, qui eduxit vos de terra Ægypti in fortitudine magna et in brachio extento, ipsum timete, et illum adorate, et ipsi immolate.
37 Cæremonias quoque, et judicia, et legem, et mandatum, quod scripsit vobis, custodite ut faciatis cunctis diebus: et non timeatis deos alienos.
38 Et pactum quod percussit vobiscum, nolite oblivisci: nec colatis deos alienos,
39 sed Dominum Deum vestrum timete, et ipse eruet vos de manu omnium inimicorum vestrorum.
40 Illi vero non audierunt, sed juxta consuetudinem suam pristinam perpetrabant.
41 Fuerunt igitur gentes istæ timentes quidem Dominum, sed nihilominus et idolis suis servientes: nam et filii eorum, et nepotes, sicut fecerunt patres sui, ita faciunt usque in præsentem diem.

1 ἐν ἔτει δωδεκάτῳ τῷ Αχαζ βασιλεῖ Ιουδα ἐβασίλευσεν Ωσηε υἱὸς Ηλα ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἐπὶ Ισραηλ ἐννέα ἔτη
2 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου πλὴν οὐχ ὡς οἱ βασιλεῖς Ισραηλ οἳ ἦσαν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ
3 ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν ἀνέβη Σαλαμανασαρ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ Ωσηε δοῦλος καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτῷ μαναα
4 καὶ εὗρεν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐν τῷ Ωσηε ἀδικίαν ὅτι ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Σηγωρ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου καὶ οὐκ ἤνεγκεν μαναα τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ καὶ ἐπολιόρκησεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐν οἴκῳ φυλακῆς
5 καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς Σαμάρειαν καὶ ἐπολιόρκησεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὴν τρία ἔτη
6 ἐν ἔτει ἐνάτῳ Ωσηε συνέλαβεν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων τὴν Σαμάρειαν καὶ ἀπῴκισεν τὸν Ισραηλ εἰς Ἀσσυρίους καὶ κατῴκισεν αὐτοὺς ἐν Αλαε καὶ ἐν Αβωρ ποταμοῖς Γωζαν καὶ Ορη Μήδων

7 καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτι ἥμαρτον οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ αὐτῶν τῷ ἀναγαγόντι αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ὑποκάτωθεν χειρὸς Φαραω βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν θεοὺς ἑτέρους
8 καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν τοῖς δικαιώμασιν τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν ἐξῆρεν κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου υἱῶν Ισραηλ καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς Ισραηλ ὅσοι ἐποίησαν
9 καὶ ὅσοι ἠμφιέσαντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ λόγους οὐχ οὕτως κατὰ κυρίου θεοῦ αὐτῶν καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν ἑαυτοῖς ὑψηλὰ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῶν ἀπὸ πύργου φυλασσόντων ἕως πόλεως ὀχυρᾶς
10 καὶ ἐστήλωσαν ἑαυτοῖς στήλας καὶ ἄλση ἐπὶ παντὶ βουνῷ ὑψηλῷ καὶ ὑποκάτω παντὸς ξύλου ἀλσώδους
11 καὶ ἐθυμίασαν ἐκεῖ ἐν πᾶσιν ὑψηλοῖς καθὼς τὰ ἔθνη ἃ ἀπῴκισεν κύριος ἐκ προσώπου αὐτῶν καὶ ἐποίησαν κοινωνοὺς καὶ ἐχάραξαν τοῦ παροργίσαι τὸν κύριον
12 καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν τοῖς εἰδώλοις οἷς εἶπεν κύριος αὐτοῖς οὐ ποιήσετε τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο κυρίῳ

13 καὶ διεμαρτύρατο κύριος ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐν τῷ Ιουδα ἐν χειρὶ πάντων τῶν προφητῶν αὐτοῦ παντὸς ὁρῶντος λέγων ἀποστράφητε ἀπὸ τῶν ὁδῶν ὑμῶν τῶν πονηρῶν καὶ φυλάξατε τὰς ἐντολάς μου καὶ τὰ δικαιώματά μου καὶ πάντα τὸν νόμον ὃν ἐνετειλάμην τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν ὅσα ἀπέστειλα αὐτοῖς ἐν χειρὶ τῶν δούλων μου τῶν προφητῶν
14 καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν καὶ ἐσκλήρυναν τὸν νῶτον αὐτῶν ὑπὲρ τὸν νῶτον τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν
15 καὶ τὰ μαρτύρια αὐτοῦ ὅσα διεμαρτύρατο αὐτοῖς οὐκ ἐφύλαξαν καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω τῶν ματαίων καὶ ἐματαιώθησαν καὶ ὀπίσω τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν περικύκλῳ αὐτῶν ὧν ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς τοῦ μὴ ποιῆσαι κατὰ ταῦτα
16 ἐγκατέλιπον τὰς ἐντολὰς κυρίου θεοῦ αὐτῶν καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς χώνευμα δύο δαμάλεις καὶ ἐποίησαν ἄλση καὶ προσεκύνησαν πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν τῷ Βααλ
17 καὶ διῆγον τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν ἐν πυρὶ καὶ ἐμαντεύοντο μαντείας καὶ οἰωνίζοντο καὶ ἐπράθησαν τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου παροργίσαι αὐτόν
18 καὶ ἐθυμώθη κύριος σφόδρα ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ ἀπέστησεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐχ ὑπελείφθη πλὴν φυλὴ Ιουδα μονωτάτη
19 καί γε Ιουδας οὐκ ἐφύλαξεν τὰς ἐντολὰς κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐν τοῖς δικαιώμασιν Ισραηλ οἷς ἐποίησαν
20 καὶ ἀπεώσαντο τὸν κύριον ἐν παντὶ σπέρματι Ισραηλ καὶ ἐσάλευσεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ διαρπαζόντων αὐτούς ἕως οὗ ἀπέρριψεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ
21 ὅτι πλὴν Ισραηλ ἐπάνωθεν οἴκου Δαυιδ καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν τὸν Ιεροβοαμ υἱὸν Ναβατ καὶ ἐξέωσεν Ιεροβοαμ τὸν Ισραηλ ἐξόπισθεν κυρίου καὶ ἐξήμαρτεν αὐτοὺς ἁμαρτίαν μεγάλην
22 καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἐν πάσῃ ἁμαρτίᾳ Ιεροβοαμ ᾗ ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἀπέστησαν ἀ{P'} αὐτῆς
23 ἕως οὗ μετέστησεν κύριος τὸν Ισραηλ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καθὼς ἐλάλησεν κύριος ἐν χειρὶ πάντων τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ τῶν προφητῶν καὶ ἀπῳκίσθη Ισραηλ ἐπάνωθεν τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἀσσυρίους ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης

24 καὶ ἤγαγεν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος τὸν ἐκ Χουνθα καὶ ἀπὸ Αια καὶ ἀπὸ Αιμαθ καὶ Σεπφαρουαιν καὶ κατῳκίσθησαν ἐν πόλεσιν Σαμαρείας ἀντὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν τὴν Σαμάρειαν καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῆς
25 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν ἀρχῇ τῆς καθέδρας αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν κύριον καὶ ἀπέστειλεν κύριος ἐν αὐτοῖς τοὺς λέοντας καὶ ἦσαν ἀποκτέννοντες ἐν αὐτοῖς
26 καὶ εἶπον τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων λέγοντες τὰ ἔθνη ἃ ἀπῴκισας καὶ ἀντεκάθισας ἐν πόλεσιν Σαμαρείας οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὸ κρίμα τοῦ θεοῦ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς αὐτοὺς τοὺς λέοντας καὶ ἰδού εἰσιν θανατοῦντες αὐτούς καθότι οὐκ οἴδασιν τὸ κρίμα τοῦ θεοῦ τῆς γῆς
27 καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων λέγων ἀπάγετε ἐκεῖθεν καὶ πορευέσθωσαν καὶ κατοικείτωσαν ἐκεῖ καὶ φωτιοῦσιν αὐτοὺς τὸ κρίμα τοῦ θεοῦ τῆς γῆς
28 καὶ ἤγαγον ἕνα τῶν ἱερέων ὧν ἀπῴκισαν ἀπὸ Σαμαρείας καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν Βαιθηλ καὶ ἦν φωτίζων αὐτοὺς πῶς φοβηθῶσιν τὸν κύριον

30 καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες Βαβυλῶνος ἐποίησαν τὴν Σοκχωθβαινιθ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες Χουθ ἐποίησαν τὴν Νηριγελ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες Αιμαθ ἐποίησαν τὴν Ασιμαθ
31 καὶ οἱ Ευαῖοι ἐποίησαν τὴν Εβλαζερ καὶ τὴν Θαρθακ καὶ οἱ Σεπφαρουαιν κατέκαιον τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν ἐν πυρὶ τῷ Αδραμελεχ καὶ Ανημελεχ θεοῖς Σεπφαρουαιν

32 καὶ ἦσαν φοβούμενοι τὸν κύριον καὶ κατῴκισαν τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις τῶν ὑψηλῶν ἃ ἐποίησαν ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἔθνος ἔθνος ἐν πόλει ἐν ᾗ κατῴκουν ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ ἦσαν φοβούμενοι τὸν κύριον καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς ἱερεῖς τῶν ὑψηλῶν καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς ἐν οἴκῳ τῶν ὑψηλῶν
33 τὸν κύριον ἐφοβοῦντο καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν ἐλάτρευον κατὰ τὸ κρίμα τῶν ἐθνῶν ὅθεν ἀπῴκισεν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖθεν
34 ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης αὐτοὶ ἐποίουν κατὰ τὸ κρίμα αὐτῶν αὐτοὶ φοβοῦνται καὶ αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσιν κατὰ τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτῶν καὶ κατὰ τὴν κρίσιν αὐτῶν καὶ κατὰ τὸν νόμον καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἐντολήν ἣν ἐνετείλατο κύριος τοῖς υἱοῖς Ιακωβ οὗ ἔθηκεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ισραηλ
35 καὶ διέθετο κύριος με{T'} αὐτῶν διαθήκην καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς λέγων οὐ φοβηθήσεσθε θεοὺς ἑτέρους καὶ οὐ προσκυνήσετε αὐτοῖς καὶ οὐ λατρεύσετε αὐτοῖς καὶ οὐ θυσιάσετε αὐτοῖς
36 ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ τῷ κυρίῳ ὃς ἀνήγαγεν ὑμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐν ἰσχύι μεγάλῃ καὶ ἐν βραχίονι ὑψηλῷ αὐτὸν φοβηθήσεσθε καὶ αὐτῷ προσκυνήσετε καὶ αὐτῷ θύσετε
37 καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα καὶ τὰ κρίματα καὶ τὸν νόμον καὶ τὰς ἐντολάς ἃς ἔγραψεν ὑμῖν φυλάσσεσθε ποιεῖν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας καὶ οὐ φοβηθήσεσθε θεοὺς ἑτέρους
38 καὶ τὴν διαθήκην ἣν διέθετο με{Q'} ὑμῶν οὐκ ἐπιλήσεσθε καὶ οὐ φοβηθήσεσθε θεοὺς ἑτέρους
39 ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ τὸν κύριον θεὸν ὑμῶν φοβηθήσεσθε καὶ αὐτὸς ἐξελεῖται ὑμᾶς ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν
40 καὶ οὐκ ἀκούσεσθε ἐπὶ τῷ κρίματι αὐτῶν ὃ αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσιν
41 καὶ ἦσαν τὰ ἔθνη ταῦτα φοβούμενοι τὸν κύριον καὶ τοῖς γλυπτοῖς αὐτῶν ἦσαν δουλεύοντες καί γε οἱ υἱοὶ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτῶν καθὰ ἐποίησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν ποιοῦσιν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
