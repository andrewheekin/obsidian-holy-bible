# Second Book of Kings 13 (RSVCE)

### Jehoahaz Reigns over Israel
1 In the twenty-third year of Joʹash the son of Ahaziʹah, king of Judah, Jehoʹahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samarʹia, and he reigned seventeen years.
2 He did what was evil in the sight of theLord, and followed the sins of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from them.
3 And the anger of theLordwas kindled against Israel, and he gave them continually into the hand of Hazʹael king of Syria and into the hand of Ben-haʹdad the son of Hazʹael.
4 Then Jehoʹahaz besought theLord, and theLordhearkened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Syria oppressed them.
5 (Therefore theLordgave Israel a savior, so that they escaped from the hand of the Syrians; and the people of Israel dwelt in their homes as formerly.
6 Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboʹam, which he made Israel to sin, but walked in them; and the Asheʹrah also remained in Samarʹia.)
7 For there was not left to Jehoʹahaz an army of more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.
8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoʹahaz and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9 So Jehoʹahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samarʹia; and Joʹash his son reigned in his stead.
### Jehoash Reigns over Israel
10 In the thirty-seventh year of Joʹash king of Judah Jehoʹash the son of Jehoʹahaz began to reign over Israel in Samarʹia, and he reigned sixteen years.
11 He also did what was evil in the sight of theLord; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin, but he walked in them.
12 Now the rest of the acts of Joʹash, and all that he did, and the might with which he fought against Amaziʹah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
13 So Joʹash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboʹam sat upon his throne; and Joʹash was buried in Samarʹia with the kings of Israel.
### Death of Elisha
14 Now when Eliʹsha had fallen sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joʹash king of Israel went down to him, and wept before him, crying, “My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”
15 And Eliʹsha said to him, “Take a bow and arrows”; so he took a bow and arrows.
16 Then he said to the king of Israel, “Draw the bow”; and he drew it. And Eliʹsha laid his hands upon the king’s hands.
17 And he said, “Open the window eastward”; and he opened it. Then Eliʹsha said, “Shoot”; and he shot. And he said, “TheLord’s arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria! For you shall fight the Syrians in Aphek until you have made an end of them.”
18 And he said, “Take the arrows”; and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground with them”; and he struck three times, and stopped.
19 Then the man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria until you had made an end of it, but now you will strike down Syria only three times.”
20 So Eliʹsha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year.
21 And as a man was being buried, lo, a marauding band was seen and the man was cast into the grave of Eliʹsha; and as soon as the man touched the bones of Eliʹsha, he revived, and stood on his feet.
### Israel Recaptures Cities from Aram
22 Now Hazʹael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoʹahaz.
23 But theLordwas gracious to them and had compassion on them, and he turned toward them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them; nor has he cast them from his presence until now.
24 When Hazʹael king of Syria died, Ben-haʹdad his son became king in his stead.
25 Then Jehoʹash the son of Jehoʹahaz took again from Ben-haʹdad the son of Hazʹael the cities which he had taken from Jehoʹahaz his father in war. Three times Joʹash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno vigesimo tertio Joas filii Ochoziæ regis Juda, regnavit Joachaz filius Jehu super Israël in Samaria decem et septem annis.
2 Et fecit malum coram Domino, secutusque est peccata Jeroboam filii Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël, et non declinavit ab eis.
3 Iratusque est furor Domini contra Israël, et tradidit eos in manu Hazaël regis Syriæ, et in manu Benadad filii Hazaël, cunctis diebus.
4 Deprecatus est autem Joachaz faciem Domini, et audivit eum Dominus: vidit enim angustiam Israël, quia attriverat eos rex Syriæ:
5 et dedit Dominus salvatorem Israëli, et liberatus est de manu regis Syriæ: habitaveruntque filii Israël in tabernaculis suis sicut heri et nudiustertius.
6 Verumtamen non recesserunt a peccatis domus Jeroboam, qui peccare fecit Israël, sed in ipsis ambulaverunt: siquidem et lucus permansit in Samaria.
7 Et non sunt derelicti Joachaz de populo nisi quinquaginta equites, et decem currus, et decem millia peditum: interfecerat enim eos rex Syriæ, et redegerat quasi pulverem in tritura areæ.
8 Reliqua autem sermonum Joachaz, et universa quæ fecit, et fortitudo ejus, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Israël?
9 Dormivitque Joachaz cum patribus suis, et sepelierunt eum in Samaria: regnavitque Joas filius ejus pro eo.

10 Anno trigesimo septimo Joas regis Juda, regnavit Joas filius Joachaz super Israël in Samaria sedecim annis.
11 Et fecit quod malum est in conspectu Domini: non declinavit ab omnibus peccatis Jeroboam filii Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël, sed in ipsis ambulavit.
12 Reliqua autem sermonum Joas, et universa quæ fecit, et fortitudo ejus, quomodo pugnaverit contra Amasiam regem Juda, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Israël?
13 Et dormivit Joas cum patribus suis: Jeroboam autem sedit super solium ejus. Porro Joas sepultus est in Samaria cum regibus Israël.

14 Eliseus autem ægrotabat infirmitate, qua et mortuus est: descenditque ad eum Joas rex Israël, et flebat coram eo, dicebatque: Pater mi, pater mi, currus Israël et auriga ejus.
15 Et ait illi Eliseus: Affer arcum et sagittas. Cumque attulisset ad eum arcum et sagittas,
16 dixit ad regem Israël: Pone manum tuam super arcum. Et cum posuisset ille manum suam, superposuit Eliseus manus suas manibus regis,
17 et ait: Aperi fenestram orientalem. Cumque aperuisset, dixit Eliseus: Jace sagittam. Et jecit. Et ait Eliseus: Sagitta salutis Domini, et sagitta salutis contra Syriam: percutiesque Syriam in Aphec, donec consumas eam.
18 Et ait: Tolle sagittas. Qui cum tulisset, rursum dixit ei: Percute jaculo terram. Et cum percussisset tribus vicibus, et stetisset,
19 iratus est vir Dei contra eum, et ait: Si percussisses quinquies, aut sexies, sive septies, percussisses Syriam usque ad consumptionem: nunc autem tribus vicibus percuties eam.

20 Mortuus est ergo Eliseus, et sepelierunt eum. Latrunculi autem de Moab venerunt in terram in ipso anno.
21 Quidam autem sepelientes hominem, viderunt latrunculos, et projecerunt cadaver in sepulchro Elisei. Quod cum tetigisset ossa Elisei, revixit homo, et stetit super pedes suos.

22 Igitur Hazaël rex Syriæ afflixit Israël cunctis diebus Joachaz:
23 et misertus est Dominus eorum, et reversus est ad eos propter pactum suum, quod habebat cum Abraham, et Isaac, et Jacob: et noluit disperdere eos, neque projicere penitus usque in præsens tempus.
24 Mortuus est autem Hazaël rex Syriæ, et regnavit Benadad filius ejus pro eo.
25 Porro Joas filius Joachaz tulit urbes de manu Benadad filii Hazaël, quas tulerat de manu Joachaz patris sui jure prælii: tribus vicibus percussit eum Joas, et reddidit civitates Israël.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 13 (Septuagint)

1 ἐν ἔτει εἰκοστῷ καὶ τρίτῳ ἔτει τῷ Ιωας υἱῷ Οχοζιου βασιλεῖ Ιουδα ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωαχας υἱὸς Ιου ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἑπτακαίδεκα ἔτη

5 καὶ ἔδωκεν κύριος σωτηρίαν τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὑποκάτωθεν χειρὸς Συρίας καὶ ἐκάθισαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἐν τοῖς σκηνώμασιν αὐτῶν καθὼς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης
6 πλὴν οὐκ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ ἁμαρτιῶν οἴκου Ιεροβοαμ ὃς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ ἐν αὐταῖς ἐπορεύθησαν καί γε τὸ ἄλσος ἐστάθη ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ
7 ὅτι οὐχ ὑπελείφθη τῷ Ιωαχας λαὸς ἀλ{L'} ἢ πεντήκοντα ἱππεῖς καὶ δέκα ἅρματα καὶ δέκα χιλιάδες πεζῶν ὅτι ἀπώλεσεν αὐτοὺς βασιλεὺς Συρίας καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτοὺς ὡς χοῦν εἰς καταπάτησιν
8 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ιωαχας καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν καὶ αἱ δυναστεῖαι αὐτοῦ οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ισραηλ
9 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ιωαχας μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ

10 ἐν ἔτει τριακοστῷ καὶ ἑβδόμῳ ἔτει τῷ Ιωας βασιλεῖ Ιουδα ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωας υἱὸς Ιωαχας ἐπὶ Ισραηλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἑκκαίδεκα ἔτη
11 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ πάσης ἁμαρτίας Ιεροβοαμ υἱοῦ Ναβατ ὃς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ ἐν αὐταῖς ἐπορεύθη
12 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ιωας καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν καὶ αἱ δυναστεῖαι αὐτοῦ ἃς ἐποίησεν μετὰ Αμεσσιου βασιλέως Ιουδα οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ισραηλ
13 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ιωας μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ Ιεροβοαμ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ μετὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ

14 καὶ Ελισαιε ἠρρώστησεν τὴν ἀρρωστίαν αὐτοῦ δ{I'} ἣν ἀπέθανεν καὶ κατέβη πρὸς αὐτὸν Ιωας βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ἐπὶ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν πάτερ πάτερ ἅρμα Ισραηλ καὶ ἱππεὺς αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ελισαιε λαβὲ τόξον καὶ βέλη καὶ ἔλαβεν πρὸς αὐτὸν τόξον καὶ βέλη
16 καὶ εἶπεν τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐπιβίβασον τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐπὶ τὸ τόξον καὶ ἐπεβίβασεν Ιωας τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ τόξον καὶ ἐπέθηκεν Ελισαιε τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ βασιλέως
17 καὶ εἶπεν ἄνοιξον τὴν θυρίδα κα{T'} ἀνατολάς καὶ ἤνοιξεν καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε τόξευσον καὶ ἐτόξευσεν καὶ εἶπεν βέλος σωτηρίας τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ βέλος σωτηρίας ἐν Συρίᾳ καὶ πατάξεις τὴν Συρίαν ἐν Αφεκ ἕως συντελείας
18 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ελισαιε λαβὲ τόξα καὶ ἔλαβεν καὶ εἶπεν τῷ βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ πάταξον εἰς τὴν γῆν καὶ ἐπάταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τρὶς καὶ ἔστη
19 καὶ ἐλυπήθη ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ εἶπεν εἰ ἐπάταξας πεντάκις ἢ ἑξάκις τότε ἂν ἐπάταξας τὴν Συρίαν ἕως συντελείας καὶ νῦν τρὶς πατάξεις τὴν Συρίαν

20 καὶ ἀπέθανεν Ελισαιε καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτόν καὶ μονόζωνοι Μωαβ ἦλθον ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐλθόντος τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ
21 καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῶν θαπτόντων τὸν ἄνδρα καὶ ἰδοὺ εἶδον τὸν μονόζωνον καὶ ἔρριψαν τὸν ἄνδρα ἐν τῷ τάφῳ Ελισαιε καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ ἥψατο τῶν ὀστέων Ελισαιε καὶ ἔζησεν καὶ ἀνέστη ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ

22 καὶ Αζαηλ ἐξέθλιψεν τὸν Ισραηλ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Ιωαχας
23 καὶ ἠλέησεν κύριος αὐτοὺς καὶ οἰκτίρησεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς διὰ τὴν διαθήκην αὐτοῦ τὴν μετὰ Αβρααμ καὶ Ισαακ καὶ Ιακωβ καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν κύριος διαφθεῖραι αὐτοὺς καὶ οὐκ ἀπέρριψεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ
24 καὶ ἀπέθανεν Αζαηλ βασιλεὺς Συρίας καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν υἱὸς Αδερ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
25 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ιωας υἱὸς Ιωαχας καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰς πόλεις ἐκ χειρὸς υἱοῦ Αδερ υἱοῦ Αζαηλ ἃς ἔλαβεν ἐκ χειρὸς Ιωαχας τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ τρὶς ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν Ιωας καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν τὰς πόλεις Ισραηλ
