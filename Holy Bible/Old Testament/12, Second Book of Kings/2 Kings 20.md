# Second Book of Kings 20 (RSVCE)

### Hezekiah’s Illness
1 In those days Hezekiʹah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says theLord, ‘Set your house in order; for you shall die, you shall not recover.’ ”
2 Then Hezekiʹah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to theLord, saying,
3 “Remember now, OLord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in thy sight.” And Hezekiʹah wept bitterly.
4 And before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of theLordcame to him:
5 “Turn back, and say to Hezekiʹah the prince of my people, Thus says theLord, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will heal you; on the third day you shall go up to the house of theLord.
6 And I will add fifteen years to your life. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David’s sake.”
7 And Isaiah said, “Bring a cake of figs. And let them take and lay it on the boil, that he may recover.”
8 And Hezekiʹah said to Isaiah, “What shall be the sign that theLordwill heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of theLordon the third day?”
9 And Isaiah said, “This is the sign to you from theLord, that theLordwill do the thing that he has promised: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?”
10 And Hezekiʹah answered, “It is an easy thing for the shadow to lengthen ten steps; rather let the shadow go back ten steps.”
11 And Isaiah the prophet cried to theLord; and he brought the shadow back ten steps, by which the sun had declined on the dial of Ahaz.
### Envoys from Babylon
12 At that time Meroʹdach-balʹadan the son of Balʹadan, king of Babylon, sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiʹah; for he heard that Hezekiʹah had been sick.
13 And Hezekiʹah welcomed them, and he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiʹah did not show them.
14 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiʹah, and said to him, “What did these men say? And whence did they come to you?” And Hezekiʹah said, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.”
15 He said, “What have they seen in your house?” And Hezekiʹah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”
16 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiʹah, “Hear the word of theLord:
17 Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says theLord.
18 And some of your own sons, who are born to you, shall be taken away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
19 Then said Hezekiʹah to Isaiah, “The word of theLordwhich you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “Why not, if there will be peace and security in my days?”
### Death of Hezekiah
20 The rest of the deeds of Hezekiʹah, and all his might, and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
21 And Hezekiʹah slept with his fathers; and Manasʹseh his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 20 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In diebus illis ægrotavit Ezechias usque ad mortem: et venit ad eum Isaias filius Amos propheta, dixitque ei: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus: Præcipe domui tuæ: morieris enim tu, et non vives.
2 Qui convertit faciem suam ad parietem, et oravit Dominum, dicens:
3 Obsecro, Domine: memento, quæso, quomodo ambulaverim coram te in veritate, et in corde perfecto, et quod placitum est coram te fecerim. Flevit itaque Ezechias fletu magno.
4 Et antequam egrederetur Isaias mediam partem atrii, factus est sermo Domini ad eum, dicens:
5 Revertere, et dic Ezechiæ duci populi mei: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus David patris tui: Audivi orationem tuam, et vidi lacrimas tuas, et ecce sanavi te: die tertio ascendes templum Domini.
6 Et addam diebus tuis quindecim annos: sed et de manu regis Assyriorum liberabo te, et civitatem hanc: et protegam urbem istam propter me, et propter David servum meum.
7 Dixitque Isaias: Afferte massam ficorum. Quam cum attulissent, et posuissent super ulcus ejus, curatus est.
8 Dixerat autem Ezechias ad Isaiam: Quod erit signum, quia Dominus me sanabit, et quia ascensurus sum die tertia templum Domini?
9 Cui ait Isaias: Hoc erit signum a Domino quod facturus sit Dominus sermonem quem locutus est: vis ut ascendat umbra decem lineis, an ut revertatur totidem gradibus?
10 Et ait Ezechias: Facile est umbram crescere decem lineis: nec hoc volo ut fiat, sed ut revertatur retrorsum decem gradibus.
11 Invocavit itaque Isaias propheta Dominum, et reduxit umbram per lineas quibus jam descenderat in horologio Achaz, retrorsum decem gradibus.

12 In tempore illo misit Berodach Baladan, filius Baladan, rex Babyloniorum, litteras et munera ad Ezechiam: audierat enim quod ægrotasset Ezechias.
13 Lætatus est autem in adventu eorum Ezechias, et ostendit eis domum aromatum, et aurum et argentum, et pigmenta varia, unguenta quoque, et domum vasorum suorum, et omnia quæ habere poterat in thesauris suis. Non fuit quod non monstraret eis Ezechias in domo sua, et in omni potestate sua.
14 Venit autem Isaias propheta ad regem Ezechiam, dixitque ei: Quid dixerunt viri isti? aut unde venerunt ad te? Cui ait Ezechias: De terra longinqua venerunt ad me, de Babylone.
15 At ille respondit: Quid viderunt in domo tua? Ait Ezechias: Omnia quæcumque sunt in domo mea, viderunt: nihil est quod non monstraverim eis in thesauris meis.
16 Dixit itaque Isaias Ezechiæ: Audi sermonem Domini:
17 Ecce dies venient, et auferentur omnia quæ sunt in domo tua, et quæ condiderunt patres tui usque in diem hanc, in Babylonem: non remanebit quidquam, ait Dominus.
18 Sed et de filiis tuis qui egredientur ex te, quos generabis, tollentur, et erunt eunuchi in palatio regis Babylonis.
19 Dixit Ezechias ad Isaiam: Bonus sermo Domini quem locutus es: sit pax et veritas in diebus meis.

20 Reliqua autem sermonum Ezechiæ, et omnis fortitudo ejus, et quomodo fecerit piscinam et aquæductum, et introduxerit aquas in civitatem, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Juda?
21 Dormivitque Ezechias cum patribus suis, et regnavit Manasses filius ejus pro eo.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 20 (Septuagint)

1 ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἠρρώστησεν Εζεκιας εἰς θάνατον καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ησαιας υἱὸς Αμως ὁ προφήτης καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν τάδε λέγει κύριος ἔντειλαι τῷ οἴκῳ σου ὅτι ἀποθνῄσκεις σὺ καὶ οὐ ζήσῃ
2 καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Εζεκιας τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὸν τοῖχον καὶ ηὔξατο πρὸς κύριον λέγων
3 ὦ δή κύριε μνήσθητι δὴ ὅσα περιεπάτησα ἐνώπιόν σου ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ ἐν καρδίᾳ πλήρει καὶ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου ἐποίησα καὶ ἔκλαυσεν Εζεκιας κλαυθμῷ μεγάλῳ
4 καὶ ἦν Ησαιας ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῇ μέσῃ καὶ ῥῆμα κυρίου ἐγένετο πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγων
5 ἐπίστρεψον καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς Εζεκιαν τὸν ἡγούμενον τοῦ λαοῦ μου τάδε λέγει κύριος ὁ θεὸς Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρός σου ἤκουσα τῆς προσευχῆς σου εἶδον τὰ δάκρυά σου ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἰάσομαί σε τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ ἀναβήσῃ εἰς οἶκον κυρίου
6 καὶ προσθήσω ἐπὶ τὰς ἡμέρας σου πέντε καὶ δέκα ἔτη καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων σώσω σε καὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην καὶ ὑπερασπιῶ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως ταύτης δ{I'} ἐμὲ καὶ διὰ Δαυιδ τὸν δοῦλόν μου
7 καὶ εἶπεν λαβέτωσαν παλάθην σύκων καὶ ἐπιθέτωσαν ἐπὶ τὸ ἕλκος καὶ ὑγιάσει
8 καὶ εἶπεν Εζεκιας πρὸς Ησαιαν τί τὸ σημεῖον ὅτι ἰάσεταί με κύριος καὶ ἀναβήσομαι εἰς οἶκον κυρίου τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ
9 καὶ εἶπεν Ησαιας τοῦτο τὸ σημεῖον παρὰ κυρίου ὅτι ποιήσει κύριος τὸν λόγον ὃν ἐλάλησεν πορεύσεται ἡ σκιὰ δέκα βαθμούς ἐὰν ἐπιστρέφῃ δέκα βαθμούς
10 καὶ εἶπεν Εζεκιας κοῦφον τὴν σκιὰν κλῖναι δέκα βαθμούς οὐχί ἀλ{L'} ἐπιστραφήτω ἡ σκιὰ δέκα βαθμοὺς εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω
11 καὶ ἐβόησεν Ησαιας ὁ προφήτης πρὸς κύριον καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ἡ σκιὰ ἐν τοῖς ἀναβαθμοῖς εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω δέκα βαθμούς

12 ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀπέστειλεν Μαρωδαχβαλαδαν υἱὸς Βαλαδαν βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος βιβλία καὶ μαναα πρὸς Εζεκιαν ὅτι ἤκουσεν ὅτι ἠρρώστησεν Εζεκιας
13 καὶ ἐχάρη ἐ{P'} αὐτοῖς Εζεκιας καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς ὅλον τὸν οἶκον τοῦ νεχωθα τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον τὰ ἀρώματα καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον τὸ ἀγαθόν καὶ τὸν οἶκον τῶν σκευῶν καὶ ὅσα ηὑρέθη ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἦν λόγος ὃν οὐκ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς Εζεκιας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ησαιας ὁ προφήτης πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Εζεκιαν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν τί ἐλάλησαν οἱ ἄνδρες οὗτοι καὶ πόθεν ἥκασιν πρὸς σέ καὶ εἶπεν Εζεκιας ἐκ γῆς πόρρωθεν ἥκασιν πρός με ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος
15 καὶ εἶπεν τί εἶδον ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου καὶ εἶπεν πάντα ὅσα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου εἶδον οὐκ ἦν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου ὃ οὐκ ἔδειξα αὐτοῖς ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς μου
16 καὶ εἶπεν Ησαιας πρὸς Εζεκιαν ἄκουσον λόγον κυρίου
17 ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται καὶ λημφθήσεται πάντα τὰ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου καὶ ὅσα ἐθησαύρισαν οἱ πατέρες σου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης εἰς Βαβυλῶνα καὶ οὐχ ὑπολειφθήσεται ῥῆμα ὃ εἶπεν κύριος
18 καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου οἳ ἐξελεύσονται ἐκ σοῦ οὓς γεννήσεις λήμψεται καὶ ἔσονται εὐνοῦχοι ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος
19 καὶ εἶπεν Εζεκιας πρὸς Ησαιαν ἀγαθὸς ὁ λόγος κυρίου ὃν ἐλάλησεν ἔστω εἰρήνη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις μου

20 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Εζεκιου καὶ πᾶσα ἡ δυναστεία αὐτοῦ καὶ ὅσα ἐποίησεν τὴν κρήνην καὶ τὸν ὑδραγωγὸν καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν τὸ ὕδωρ εἰς τὴν πόλιν οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ιουδα
21 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Εζεκιας μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Μανασσης υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
