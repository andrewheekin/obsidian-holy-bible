# Second Book of Kings 15 (RSVCE)

### Azariah Reigns over Judah
1 In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboʹam king of Israel Azariʹah the son of Amaziʹah, king of Judah, began to reign.
2 He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliʹah of Jerusalem.
3 And he did what was right in the eyes of theLord, according to all that his father Amaziʹah had done.
4 Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
5 And theLordsmote the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and he dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the king’s son was over the household, governing the people of the land.
6 Now the rest of the acts of Azariʹah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
7 And Azariʹah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
### Zechariah Reigns over Israel
8 In the thirty-eighth year of Azariʹah king of Judah Zechariʹah the son of Jeroboʹam reigned over Israel in Samarʹia six months.
9 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord, as his fathers had done. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
10 Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him down at Ibleam, and killed him, and reigned in his stead.
11 Now the rest of the deeds of Zechariʹah, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
12 (This was the promise of theLordwhich he gave to Jehu, “Your sons shall sit upon the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.” And so it came to pass.)
### Shallum Reigns over Israel
13 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziʹah king of Judah, and he reigned one month in Samarʹia.
14 Then Menʹahem the son of Gadi came up from Tirzah and came to Samarʹia, and he struck down Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samarʹia and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
15 Now the rest of the deeds of Shallum, and the conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
16 At that time Menʹahem sacked Tapʹpu-ah and all who were in it and its territory from Tirzah on; because they did not open it to him, therefore he sacked it, and he ripped up all the women in it who were with child.
### Menahem Reigns over Israel
17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariʹah king of Judah Menʹahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel, and he reigned ten years in Samarʹia.
18 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord; he did not depart all his days from all the sins of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
19 Pul the king of Assyria came against the land; and Menʹahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that he might help him to confirm his hold of the royal power.
20 Menʹahem exacted the money from Israel, that is, from all the wealthy men, fifty shekels of silver from every man, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and did not stay there in the land.
21 Now the rest of the deeds of Menʹahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
22 And Menʹahem slept with his fathers, and Pekahiʹah his son reigned in his stead.
### Pekahiah Reigns over Israel
23 In the fiftieth year of Azariʹah king of Judah Pekahiʹah the son of Menʹahem began to reign over Israel in Samarʹia, and he reigned two years.
24 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord; he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
25 And Pekah the son of Remaliʹah, his captain, conspired against him with fifty men of the Gileadites, and slew him in Samarʹia, in the citadel of the king’s house; he slew him, and reigned in his stead.
26 Now the rest of the deeds of Pekahiʹah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
### Pekah Reigns over Israel
27 In the fifty-second year of Azariʹah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliʹah began to reign over Israel in Samarʹia, and he reigned twenty years.
28 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel Tigʹlath-pileʹser king of Assyria came and captured Iʹjon, Aʹbel-beth-maʹacah, Jan-oʹah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphʹtali; and he carried the people captive to Assyria.
30 Then Hosheʹa the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliʹah, and struck him down, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziʹah.
31 Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
### Jotham Reigns over Judah
32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliʹah, king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziʹah, king of Judah, began to reign.
33 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jeruʹsha the daughter of Zadok.
34 And he did what was right in the eyes of theLord, according to all that his father Uzziʹah had done.
35 Nevertheless the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of theLord.
36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
37 In those days theLordbegan to send Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliʹah against Judah.
38 Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 15 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno vigesimo septimo Jeroboam regis Israël, regnavit Azarias filius Amasiæ regis Juda.
2 Sedecim annorum erat cum regnare cœpisset, et quinquaginta duobus annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Jechelia de Jerusalem.
3 Fecitque quod erat placitum coram Domino, juxta omnia quæ fecit Amasias pater ejus.
4 Verumtamen excelsa non est demolitus: adhuc populus sacrificabat, et adolebat incensum in excelsis.
5 Percussit autem Dominus regem, et fuit leprosus usque in diem mortis suæ, et habitabat in domo libera seorsum: Joatham vero filius regis gubernabat palatium, et judicabit populum terræ.
6 Reliqua autem sermonum Azariæ, et universa quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Juda?
7 Et dormivit Azarias cum patribus suis: sepelieruntque eum cum majoribus suis in civitate David, et regnavit Joatham filius ejus pro eo.

8 Anno trigesimo octavo Azariæ regis Juda, regnavit Zacharias filius Jeroboam super Israël in Samaria sex mensibus.
9 Et fecit quod malum est coram Domino, sicut fecerant patres ejus: non recessit a peccatis Jeroboam filii Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël.
10 Conjuravit autem contra eum Sellum filius Jabes: percussitque eum palam, et interfecit, regnavitque pro eo.
11 Reliqua autem verborum Zachariæ, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Israël?
12 Iste est sermo Domini quem locutus est ad Jehu, dicens: Filii tui usque ad quartam generationem sedebunt super thronum Israël. Factumque est ita.
13 Sellum filius Jabes regnavit trigesimo novo anno Azariæ regis Juda: regnavit autem uno mense in Samaria.
14 Et ascendit Manahem filius Gadi de Thersa, venitque in Samariam, et percussit Sellum filium Jabes in Samaria, et interfecit eum: regnavitque pro eo.
15 Reliqua autem verborum Sellum, et conjuratio ejus, per quam tetendit insidias, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Israël?
16 Tunc percussit Manahem Thapsam, et omnes qui erant in ea, et terminos ejus de Thersa: noluerant enim aperire ei: et interfecit omnes prægnantes ejus, et scidit eas.

17 Anno trigesimo nono Azariæ regis Juda, regnavit Manahem filius Gadi super Israël decem annis in Samaria.
18 Fecitque quod erat malum coram Domino: non recessit a peccatis Jeroboam filii Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël, cunctis diebus ejus.
19 Veniebat Phul rex Assyriorum in terram, et dabat Manahem Phul mille talenta argenti, ut esset ei in auxilium, et firmaret regnum ejus.
20 Indixitque Manahem argentum super Israël cunctis potentibus et divitibus, ut daret regi Assyriorum quinquaginta siclos argenti per singulos: reversusque est rex Assyriorum, et non est moratus in terra.
21 Reliqua autem sermonum Manahem, et universa quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Israël?
22 Et dormivit Manahem cum patribus suis: regnavitque Phaceia filius ejus pro eo.
23 Anno quinquagesimo Azariæ regis Juda, regnavit Phaceia filius Manahem super Israël in Samaria biennio.
24 Et fecit quod erat malum coram Domino: non recessit a peccatis Jeroboam filii Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël.
25 Conjuravit autem adversus eum Phacee filius Romeliæ, dux ejus, et percussit eum in Samaria in turre domus regiæ, juxta Argob et juxta Arie, et cum eo quinquaginta viros de filiis Galaaditarum: et interfecit eum, regnavitque pro eo.
26 Reliqua autem sermonum Phaceia, et universa quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Israël?

27 Anno quinquagesimo secundo Azariæ regis Juda, regnavit Phacee filius Romeliæ super Israël in Samaria viginti annis.
28 Et fecit quod erat malum coram Domino: non recessit a peccatis Jeroboam filii Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël.
29 In diebus Phacee regis Israël, venit Theglathphalasar rex Assur, et cepit Ajon, et Abel Domum, Maacha et Janoë, et Cedes, et Asor, et Galaad, et Galilæam, et universam terram Nephthali: et transtulit eos in Assyrios.
30 Conjuravit autem et tetendit insidias Osee filius Ela contra Phacee filium Romeliæ, et percussit eum, et interfecit: regnavitque pro eo vigesimo anno Joatham filii Oziæ.
31 Reliqua autem sermonum Phacee, et universa quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Israël?

32 Anno secundo Phacee filii Romeliæ regis Israël, regnavit Joatham filius Oziæ regis Juda.
33 Viginti quinque annorum erat cum regnare cœpisset, et sedecim annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Jerusa filia Sadoc.
34 Fecitque quod erat placitum coram Domino: juxta omnia quæ fecerat Ozias pater suus, operatus est.
35 Verumtamen excelsa non abstulit: adhuc populus immolabat, et adolebat incensum in excelsis. Ipse ædificavit portam domus Domini sublimissimam.
36 Reliqua autem sermonum Joatham, et universa quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Juda?
37 In diebus illis cœpit Dominus mittere in Judam Rasin regem Syriæ, et Phacee filium Romeliæ.
38 Et dormivit Joatham cum patribus suis, sepultusque est cum eis in civitate David patris sui: et regnavit Achaz filius ejus pro eo.
