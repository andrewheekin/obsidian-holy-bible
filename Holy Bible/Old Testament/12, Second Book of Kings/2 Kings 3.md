# Second Book of Kings 3 (RSVCE)

### Jehoram Reigns over Israel
1 In the eighteenth year of Jehoshʹaphat king of Judah, Jehorʹam the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samarʹia, and he reigned twelve years.
2 He did what was evil in the sight of theLord, though not like his father and mother, for he put away the pillar of Baʹal which his father had made.
3 Nevertheless he clung to the sin of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from it.
### War with Moab
4 Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he had to deliver annually to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
5 But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
6 So King Jehorʹam marched out of Samarʹia at that time and mustered all Israel.
7 And he went and sent word to Jehoshʹaphat king of Judah, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me; will you go with me to battle against Moab?” And he said, “I will go; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
8 Then he said, “By which way shall we march?” Jehorʹam answered, “By the way of the wilderness of Edom.”
9 So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. And when they had made a circuitous march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the beasts which followed them.
10 Then the king of Israel said, “Alas! TheLordhas called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.”
11 And Jehoshʹaphat said, “Is there no prophet of theLordhere, through whom we may inquire of theLord?” Then one of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Eliʹsha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Eliʹjah.”
12 And Jehoshʹaphat said, “The word of theLordis with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshʹaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
13 And Eliʹsha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.” But the king of Israel said to him, “No; it is theLordwho has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.”
14 And Eliʹsha said, “As theLordof hosts lives, whom I serve, were it not that I have regard for Jehoshʹaphat the king of Judah, I would neither look at you, nor see you.
15 But now bring me a minstrel.” And when the minstrel played, the power of theLordcame upon him.
16 And he said, “Thus says theLord, ‘I will make this dry stream-bed full of pools.’
17 For thus says theLord, ‘You shall not see wind or rain, but that stream-bed shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, you, your cattle, and your beasts.’
18 This is a light thing in the sight of theLord; he will also give the Moabites into your hand,
19 and you shall conquer every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop up all springs of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.”
20 The next morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came from the direction of Edom, till the country was filled with water.
21 When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to put on armor, from the youngest to the oldest, were called out, and were drawn up at the frontier.
22 And when they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.
23 And they said, “This is blood; the kings have surely fought together, and slain one another. Now then, Moab, to the spoil!”
24 But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and attacked the Moabites, till they fled before them; and they went forward, slaughtering the Moabites as they went.
25 And they overthrew the cities, and on every good piece of land every man threw a stone, until it was covered; they stopped every spring of water, and felled all the good trees; till only its stones were left in Kir-harʹeseth, and the slingers surrounded and conquered it.
26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through, opposite the king of Edom; but they could not.
27 Then he took his eldest son who was to reign in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there came great wrath upon Israel; and they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Joram vero filius Achab regnavit super Israël in Samaria anno decimooctavo Josaphat regis Judæ: regnavitque duodecim annis.
2 Et fecit malum coram Domino, sed non sicut pater suus et mater: tulit enim statuas Baal quas fecerat pater ejus.
3 Verumtamen in peccatis Jeroboam filii Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël, adhæsit, nec recessit ab eis.

4 Porro Mesa rex Moab nutriebat pecora multa, et solvebat regi Israël centum millia agnorum, et centum millia arietum cum velleribus suis.
5 Cumque mortuus fuisset Achab, prævaricatus est fœdus quod habebat cum rege Israël.
6 Egressus est igitur rex Joram in die illa de Samaria, et recensuit universum Israël.
7 Misitque ad Josaphat regem Juda, dicens: Rex Moab recessit a me: veni mecum contra eum ad prælium. Qui respondit: Ascendam: qui meus est, tuus est: populus meus, populus tuus, et equi mei, equi tui.
8 Dixitque: Per quam viam ascendemus? At ille respondit: Per desertum Idumææ.
9 Perrexerunt igitur rex Israël, et rex Juda, et rex Edom, et circuierunt per viam septem dierum, nec erat aqua exercitui et jumentis quæ sequebantur eos.
10 Dixitque rex Israël: Heu! heu! heu! congregavit nos Dominus tres reges ut traderet in manus Moab.

11 Et ait Josaphat: Estne hic propheta Domini, ut deprecemur Dominum per eum? Et respondit unus de servis regis Israël: Est hic Eliseus filius Saphat, qui fundebat aquam super manus Eliæ.
12 Et ait Josaphat: Est apud eum sermo Domini. Descenditque ad eum rex Israël, et Josaphat rex Juda, et rex Edom.
13 Dixit autem Eliseus ad regem Israël: Quid mihi et tibi est? vade ad prophetas patris tui et matris tuæ. Et ait illi rex Israël: Quare congregavit Dominus tres reges hos ut traderet eos in manus Moab?
14 Dixitque ad eum Eliseus: Vivit Dominus exercituum, in cujus conspectu sto, quod si non vultum Josaphat regis Judæ erubescerem, non attendissem quidem te, nec respexissem.
15 Nunc autem adducite mihi psaltem. Cumque caneret psaltes, facta est super eum manus Domini, et ait:
16 Hæc dicit Dominus: Facite alveum torrentis hujus fossas et fossas.
17 Hæc enim dicit Dominus: Non videbitis ventum, neque pluviam: et alveus iste replebitur aquis, et bibetis vos, et familiæ vestræ, et jumenta vestra.
18 Parumque est hoc in conspectu Domini: insuper tradet etiam Moab in manus vestras.
19 Et percutietis omnem civitatem munitam, et omnem urbem electam, et universum lignum fructiferum succidetis, cunctosque fontes aquarum obturabitis, et omnem agrum egregium operietis lapidibus.

20 Factum est igitur mane, quando sacrificium offerri solet, et ecce aquæ veniebant per viam Edom, et repleta est terra aquis.
21 Universi autem Moabitæ audientes quod ascendissent reges ut pugnarent adversum eos, convocaverunt omnes qui accincti erant balteo desuper, et steterunt in terminis.
22 Primoque mane surgentes, et orto jam sole ex adverso aquarum, viderunt Moabitæ e contra aquas rubras quasi sanguinem,
23 dixeruntque: Sanguis gladii est: pugnaverunt reges contra se, et cæsi sunt mutuo: nunc perge ad prædam, Moab.
24 Perrexeruntque in castra Israël: porro consurgens Israël, percussit Moab: at illi fugerunt coram eis. Venerunt igitur qui vicerant, et percusserunt Moab,
25 et civitates destruxerunt: et omnem agrum optimum, mittentes singuli lapides, repleverunt: et universos fontes aquarum obturaverunt: et omnia ligna fructifera succiderunt, ita ut muri tantum fictiles remanerent: et circumdata est civitas a fundibulariis, et magna ex parte percussa.

26 Quod cum vidisset rex Moab, prævaluisse scilicet hostes, tulit secum septingentos viros educentes gladium, ut irrumperent ad regem Edom: et non potuerunt.
27 Arripiensque filium suum primogenitum, qui regnaturus erat pro eo, obtulit holocaustum super murum: et facta est indignatio magna in Israël, statimque recesserunt ab eo, et reversi sunt in terram suam.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 3 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ Ιωραμ υἱὸς Αχααβ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ισραηλ ἐν ἔτει ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῳ Ιωσαφατ βασιλεῖ Ιουδα καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν δώδεκα ἔτη
2 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου πλὴν οὐχ ὡς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐχ ὡς ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ καὶ μετέστησεν τὰς στήλας τοῦ Βααλ ἃς ἐποίησεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ
3 πλὴν ἐν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ Ιεροβοαμ υἱοῦ Ναβατ ὃς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ ἐκολλήθη οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀ{P'} αὐτῆς

4 καὶ Μωσα βασιλεὺς Μωαβ ἦν νωκηδ καὶ ἐπέστρεφεν τῷ βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ ἐν τῇ ἐπαναστάσει ἑκατὸν χιλιάδας ἀρνῶν καὶ ἑκατὸν χιλιάδας κριῶν ἐπὶ πόκων
5 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν Αχααβ καὶ ἠθέτησεν βασιλεὺς Μωαβ ἐν βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ
6 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ιωραμ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ Σαμαρείας καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο τὸν Ισραηλ
7 καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν πρὸς Ιωσαφατ βασιλέα Ιουδα λέγων βασιλεὺς Μωαβ ἠθέτησεν ἐν ἐμοί εἰ πορεύσῃ με{T'} ἐμοῦ εἰς Μωαβ εἰς πόλεμον καὶ εἶπεν ἀναβήσομαι ὅμοιός μοι ὅμοιός σοι ὡς ὁ λαός μου ὁ λαός σου ὡς οἱ ἵπποι μου οἱ ἵπποι σου
8 καὶ εἶπεν ποίᾳ ὁδῷ ἀναβῶ καὶ εἶπεν ὁδὸν ἔρημον Εδωμ
9 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Εδωμ καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν ὁδὸν ἑπτὰ ἡμερῶν καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὕδωρ τῇ παρεμβολῇ καὶ τοῖς κτήνεσιν τοῖς ἐν τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτῶν
10 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ ὦ ὅτι κέκληκεν κύριος τοὺς τρεῖς βασιλεῖς παρερχομένους δοῦναι αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ Μωαβ

11 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωσαφατ οὐκ ἔστιν ὧδε προφήτης τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ἐπιζητήσωμεν τὸν κύριον πα{R'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπεκρίθη εἷς τῶν παίδων βασιλέως Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν ὧδε Ελισαιε υἱὸς Σαφατ ὃς ἐπέχεεν ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας Ηλιου
12 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωσαφατ ἔστιν αὐτῷ ῥῆμα κυρίου καὶ κατέβη πρὸς αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ Ιωσαφατ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα καὶ βασιλεὺς Εδωμ
13 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε πρὸς βασιλέα Ισραηλ τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί δεῦρο πρὸς τοὺς προφήτας τοῦ πατρός σου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ μή ὅτι κέκληκεν κύριος τοὺς τρεῖς βασιλεῖς τοῦ παραδοῦναι αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας Μωαβ
14 καὶ εἶπεν Ελισαιε ζῇ κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ᾧ παρέστην ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ὅτι εἰ μὴ πρόσωπον Ιωσαφατ βασιλέως Ιουδα ἐγὼ λαμβάνω εἰ ἐπέβλεψα πρὸς σὲ καὶ εἶδόν σε
15 καὶ νυνὶ δὲ λαβέ μοι ψάλλοντα καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἔψαλλεν ὁ ψάλλων καὶ ἐγένετο ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν χεὶρ κυρίου
16 καὶ εἶπεν τάδε λέγει κύριος ποιήσατε τὸν χειμάρρουν τοῦτον βοθύνους βοθύνους
17 ὅτι τάδε λέγει κύριος οὐκ ὄψεσθε πνεῦμα καὶ οὐκ ὄψεσθε ὑετόν καὶ ὁ χειμάρρους οὗτος πλησθήσεται ὕδατος καὶ πίεσθε ὑμεῖς καὶ αἱ κτήσεις ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ κτήνη ὑμῶν
18 καὶ κούφη αὕτη ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου καὶ παραδώσω τὴν Μωαβ ἐν χειρὶ ὑμῶν
19 καὶ πατάξετε πᾶσαν πόλιν ὀχυρὰν καὶ πᾶν ξύλον ἀγαθὸν καταβαλεῖτε καὶ πάσας πηγὰς ὕδατος ἐμφράξετε καὶ πᾶσαν μερίδα ἀγαθὴν ἀχρειώσετε ἐν λίθοις

20 καὶ ἐγένετο τὸ πρωὶ ἀναβαινούσης τῆς θυσίας καὶ ἰδοὺ ὕδατα ἤρχοντο ἐξ ὁδοῦ Εδωμ καὶ ἐπλήσθη ἡ γῆ ὕδατος
21 καὶ πᾶσα Μωαβ ἤκουσαν ὅτι ἀνέβησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς πολεμεῖν αὐτούς καὶ ἀνεβόησαν ἐκ παντὸς περιεζωσμένου ζώνην καὶ ἐπάνω καὶ ἔστησαν ἐπὶ τοῦ ὁρίου
22 καὶ ὤρθρισαν τὸ πρωί καὶ ὁ ἥλιος ἀνέτειλεν ἐπὶ τὰ ὕδατα καὶ εἶδεν Μωαβ ἐξ ἐναντίας τὰ ὕδατα πυρρὰ ὡσεὶ αἷμα
23 καὶ εἶπαν αἷμα τοῦτο τῆς ῥομφαίας ἐμαχέσαντο οἱ βασιλεῖς καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἀνὴρ τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ καὶ νῦν ἐπὶ τὰ σκῦλα Μωαβ
24 καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Ισραηλ καὶ Ισραηλ ἀνέστησαν καὶ ἐπάταξαν τὴν Μωαβ καὶ ἔφυγον ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰσπορευόμενοι καὶ τύπτοντες τὴν Μωαβ
25 καὶ τὰς πόλεις καθεῖλον καὶ πᾶσαν μερίδα ἀγαθὴν ἔρριψαν ἀνὴρ τὸν λίθον καὶ ἐνέπλησαν αὐτὴν καὶ πᾶσαν πηγὴν ὕδατος ἐνέφραξαν καὶ πᾶν ξύλον ἀγαθὸν κατέβαλον ἕως τοῦ καταλιπεῖν τοὺς λίθους τοῦ τοίχου καθῃρημένους καὶ ἐκύκλευσαν οἱ σφενδονῆται καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτήν

26 καὶ εἶδεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Μωαβ ὅτι ἐκραταίωσεν ὑπὲρ αὐτὸν ὁ πόλεμος καὶ ἔλαβεν με{Q'} ἑαυτοῦ ἑπτακοσίους ἄνδρας ἐσπασμένους ῥομφαίαν διακόψαι πρὸς βασιλέα Εδωμ καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν
27 καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν πρωτότοκον ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν αὐτὸν ὁλοκαύτωμα ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους καὶ ἐγένετο μετάμελος μέγας ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἀπῆραν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς τὴν γῆν
