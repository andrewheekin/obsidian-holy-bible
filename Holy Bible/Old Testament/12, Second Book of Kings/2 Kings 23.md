# Second Book of Kings 23 (RSVCE)

### Josiah’s Reformation
1 Then the king sent, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him.
2 And the king went up to the house of theLord, and with him all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests and the prophets, all the people, both small and great; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of theLord.
3 And the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before theLord, to walk after theLordand to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book; and all the people joined in the covenant.
4 And the king commanded Hilkiʹah, the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of the temple of theLordall the vessels made for Baʹal, for Asheʹrah, and for all the host of heaven; he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.
5 And he deposed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places at the cities of Judah and round about Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baʹal, to the sun, and the moon, and the constellations, and all the host of the heavens.
6 And he brought out the Asheʹrah from the house of theLord, outside Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust and cast the dust of it upon the graves of the common people.
7 And he broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes which were in the house of theLord, where the women wove hangings for the Asheʹrah.
8 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on one’s left at the gate of the city.
9 However, the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of theLordin Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brethren.
10 And he defiled Toʹpheth, which is in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, that no one might burn his son or his daughter as an offering to Molech.
11 And he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of theLord, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
12 And the altars on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasʹseh had made in the two courts of the house of theLord, he pulled down and broke in pieces, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
13 And the king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, to the south of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashʹtoreth the abomination of the Sidoʹnians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
14 And he broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asheʹrim, and filled their places with the bones of men.
15 Moreover the altar at Bethel, the high place erected by Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, that altar with the high place he pulled down and he broke in pieces its stones, crushing them to dust; also he burned the Asheʹrah.
16 And as Josiʹah turned, he saw the tombs there on the mount; and he sent and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of theLordwhich the man of God proclaimed, who had predicted these things.
17 Then he said, “What is yonder monument that I see?” And the men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted these things which you have done against the altar at Bethel.”
18 And he said, “Let him be; let no man move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samarʹia.
19 And all the shrines also of the high places that were in the cities of Samarʹia, which kings of Israel had made, provoking theLordto anger, Josiʹah removed; he did to them according to all that he had done at Bethel.
20 And he slew all the priests of the high places who were there, upon the altars, and burned the bones of men upon them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
### The Passover Celebrated
21 And the king commanded all the people, “Keep the passover to theLordyour God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.”
22 For no such passover had been kept since the days of the judges who judged Israel, or during all the days of the kings of Israel or of the kings of Judah;
23 but in the eighteenth year of King Josiʹah this passover was kept to theLordin Jerusalem.
24 Moreover Josiʹah put away the mediums and the wizards and the teraphim and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might establish the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiʹah the priest found in the house of theLord.
25 Before him there was no king like him, who turned to theLordwith all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him.
26 Still theLorddid not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, by which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasʹseh had provoked him.
27 And theLordsaid, “I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.”
### Josiah Dies in Battle
28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiʹah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
29 In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphraʹtes. King Josiʹah went to meet him; and Pharaoh Neco slew him at Megidʹdo, when he saw him.
30 And his servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megidʹdo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoʹahaz the son of Josiʹah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead.
### Reign and Captivity of Jehoahaz
31 Jehoʹahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamuʹtal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
32 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord, according to all that his fathers had done.
33 And Pharaoh Neco put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and laid upon the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
34 And Pharaoh Neco made Eliʹakim the son of Josiʹah king in the place of Josiʹah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiʹakim. But he took Jehoʹahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.
35 And Jehoiʹakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land to give the money according to the command of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, from every one according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Neco.
### Jehoiakim Reigns over Judah
36 Jehoiʹakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebiʹdah the daughter of Pedaiʹah of Rumah.
37 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord, according to all that his fathers had done.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 23 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et renuntiaverunt regi quod dixerat. Qui misit: et congregati sunt ad eum omnes senes Juda et Jerusalem.
2 Ascenditque rex templum Domini, et omnes viri Juda, universique qui habitabant in Jerusalem cum eo sacerdotes et prophetæ, et omnis populus a parvo usque ad magnum: legitque, cunctis audientibus, omnia verba libri fœderis, qui inventus est in domo Domini.
3 Stetitque rex super gradum: et fœdus percussit coram Domino, ut ambularent post Dominum, et custodirent præcepta ejus, et testimonia, et cæremonias in omni corde, et in tota anima, et suscitarent verba fœderis hujus, quæ scripta erant in libro illo: acquievitque populus pacto.

4 Et præcepit rex Helciæ pontifici, et sacerdotibus secundi ordinis, et janitoribus, ut projicerent de templo Domini omnia vasa quæ facta fuerant Baal, et in luco, et universæ militiæ cæli: et combussit ea foris Jerusalem in convalle Cedron, et tulit pulverem eorum in Bethel.
5 Et delevit aruspices quos posuerant reges Juda ad sacrificandum in excelsis per civitates Juda, et in circuitu Jerusalem: et eos qui adolebant incensum Baal, et soli, et lunæ, et duodecim signis, et omni militiæ cæli.
6 Et efferri fecit lucum de domo Domini foras Jerusalem in convalle Cedron, et combussit eum ibi, et redegit in pulverem, et projecit super sepulchra vulgi.
7 Destruxit quoque ædiculas effeminatorum quæ erant in domo Domini, pro quibus mulieres texebant quasi domunculas luci.
8 Congregavitque omnes sacerdotes de civitatibus Juda, et contaminavit excelsa ubi sacrificabant sacerdotes de Gabaa usque Bersabee, et destruxit aras portarum in introitu ostii Josue principis civitatis, quod erat ad sinistram portæ civitatis.
9 Verumtamen non ascendebant sacerdotes excelsorum ad altare Domini in Jerusalem: sed tantum comedebant azyma in medio fratrum suorum.
10 Contaminavit quoque Topheth, quod est in convalle filii Ennom, ut nemo consecraret filium suum aut filiam per ignem, Moloch.
11 Abstulit quoque equos quos dederant reges Juda soli in introitu templi Domini juxta exedram Nathanmelech eunuchi, qui erat in Pharurim: currus autem solis combussit igni.
12 Altaria quoque quæ erant super tecta cœnaculi Achaz, quæ fecerant reges Juda, et altaria quæ fecerat Manasses in duobus atriis templi Domini, destruxit rex, et cucurrit inde, et dispersit cinerem eorum in torrentem Cedron.
13 Excelsa quoque, quæ erant in Jerusalem ad dexteram partem montis offensionis, quæ ædificaverat Salomon rex Israël Astaroth idolo Sidoniorum, et Chamos offensioni Moab, et Melchom abominationi filiorum Ammon, polluit rex.
14 Et contrivit statuas, et succidit lucos: replevitque loca eorum ossibus mortuorum.

15 Insuper et altare quod erat in Bethel, et excelsum quod fecerat Jeroboam filius Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël: et altare illud, et excelsum destruxit, atque combussit, et comminuit in pulverem, succenditque etiam lucum.
16 Et conversus Josias, vidit ibi sepulchra quæ erant in monte: misitque et tulit ossa de sepulchris, et combussit ea super altare, et polluit illud juxta verbum Domini quod locutus est vir Dei, qui prædixerat verba hæc.
17 Et ait: Quis est titulus ille, quem video? Responderuntque ei cives urbis illius: Sepulchrum est hominis Dei, qui venit de Juda, et prædixit verba hæc, quæ fecisti super altare Bethel.
18 Et ait: Dimitte eum: nemo commoveat ossa ejus. Et intacta manserunt ossa illius cum ossibus prophetæ qui venerat de Samaria.
19 Insuper et omnia fana excelsorum quæ erant in civitatibus Samariæ, quæ fecerant reges Israël ad irritandum Dominum, abstulit Josias: et fecit eis secundum omnia opera quæ fecerat in Bethel.
20 Et occidit universos sacerdotes excelsorum qui erant ibi super altaria, et combussit ossa humana super ea: reversusque est Jerusalem.

21 Et præcepit omni populo, dicens: Facite Phase Domino Deo vestro, secundum quod scriptum est in libro fœderis hujus.
22 Nec enim factum est Phase tale a diebus judicum qui judicaverunt Israël, et omnium dierum regum Israël et regum Juda,
23 sicut in octavodecimo anno regis Josiæ factum est Phase istud Domino in Jerusalem.
24 Sed et pythones, et ariolos, et figuras idolorum, et immunditias, et abominationes, quæ fuerant in terra Juda et Jerusalem, abstulit Josias: ut statueret verba legis quæ scripta sunt in libro quem invenit Helcias sacerdos in templo Domini.
25 Similis illi non fuit ante eum rex, qui reverteretur ad Dominum in omni corde suo, et in tota anima sua, et in universa virtute sua juxta omnem legem Moysi: neque post eum surrexit similis illi.
26 Verumtamen non est aversus Dominus ab ira furoris sui magni quo iratus est furor ejus contra Judam propter irritationes quibus provocaverat eum Manasses.
27 Dixit itaque Dominus: Etiam Judam auferam a facie mea, sicut abstuli Israël: et projiciam civitatem hanc quam elegi Jerusalem, et domum de qua dixi: Erit nomen meum ibi.

28 Reliqua autem sermonum Josiæ, et universa quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Juda?
29 In diebus ejus ascendit Pharao Nechao rex Ægypti contra regem Assyriorum ad flumen Euphraten, et abiit Josias rex in occursum ejus: et occisus est in Mageddo cum vidisset eum.
30 Et portaverunt eum servi sui mortuum de Mageddo: et pertulerunt in Jerusalem, et sepelierunt eum in sepulchro suo. Tulitque populus terræ Joachaz filium Josiæ: et unxerunt eum, et constituerunt eum regem pro patre suo.

31 Viginti trium annorum erat Joachaz cum regnare cœpisset, et tribus mensibus regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Amital filia Jeremiæ de Lobna.
32 Et fecit malum coram Domino, juxta omnia quæ fecerant patres ejus.
33 Vinxitque eum Pharao Nechao in Rebla, quæ est in terra Emath, ne regnaret in Jerusalem: et imposuit mulctam terræ centum talentis argenti, et talento auri.
34 Regemque constituit Pharao Nechao Eliacim filium Josiæ pro Josia patre ejus: vertitque nomen ejus Joakim. Porro Joachaz tulit, et duxit in Ægyptum, et mortuus est ibi.
35 Argentum autem et aurum dedit Joakim Pharaoni, cum indixisset terræ per singulos, ut conferretur juxta præceptum Pharaonis: et unumquemque juxta vires suas exegit, tam argentum quam aurum, de populo terræ, ut daret Pharaoni Nechao.
36 Viginti quinque annorum erat Joakim cum regnare cœpisset, et undecim annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Zebida filia Phadaia de Ruma.
37 Et fecit malum coram Domino juxta omnia quæ fecerant patres ejus.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 23 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ συνήγαγεν πρὸς ἑαυτὸν πάντας τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ιουδα καὶ Ιερουσαλημ
2 καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς οἶκον κυρίου καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ιουδα καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ιερουσαλημ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ προφῆται καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἀπὸ μικροῦ καὶ ἕως μεγάλου καὶ ἀνέγνω ἐν ὠσὶν αὐτῶν πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ βιβλίου τῆς διαθήκης τοῦ εὑρεθέντος ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου
3 καὶ ἔστη ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς τὸν στῦλον καὶ διέθετο διαθήκην ἐνώπιον κυρίου τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω κυρίου καὶ τοῦ φυλάσσειν τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ μαρτύρια αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ ἐν πάσῃ καρδίᾳ καὶ ἐν πάσῃ ψυχῇ τοῦ ἀναστῆσαι τοὺς λόγους τῆς διαθήκης ταύτης τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο καὶ ἔστη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ διαθήκῃ

4 καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Χελκια τῷ ἱερεῖ τῷ μεγάλῳ καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν τῆς δευτερώσεως καὶ τοῖς φυλάσσουσιν τὸν σταθμὸν τοῦ ἐξαγαγεῖν ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ κυρίου πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ πεποιημένα τῷ Βααλ καὶ τῷ ἄλσει καὶ πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ κατέκαυσεν αὐτὰ ἔξω Ιερουσαλημ ἐν σαδημωθ Κεδρων καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸν χοῦν αὐτῶν εἰς Βαιθηλ
5 καὶ κατέπαυσεν τοὺς χωμαριμ οὓς ἔδωκαν βασιλεῖς Ιουδα καὶ ἐθυμίων ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς καὶ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν Ιουδα καὶ τοῖς περικύκλῳ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τοὺς θυμιῶντας τῷ Βααλ καὶ τῷ ἡλίῳ καὶ τῇ σελήνῃ καὶ τοῖς μαζουρωθ καὶ πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ οὐρανοῦ
6 καὶ ἐξήνεγκεν τὸ ἄλσος ἐξ οἴκου κυρίου ἔξωθεν Ιερουσαλημ εἰς τὸν χειμάρρουν Κεδρων καὶ κατέκαυσεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ Κεδρων καὶ ἐλέπτυνεν εἰς χοῦν καὶ ἔρριψεν τὸν χοῦν αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν τάφον τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ λαοῦ
7 καὶ καθεῖλεν τὸν οἶκον τῶν καδησιμ τῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ κυρίου οὗ αἱ γυναῖκες ὕφαινον ἐκεῖ χεττιιν τῷ ἄλσει
8 καὶ ἀνήγαγεν πάντας τοὺς ἱερεῖς ἐκ πόλεων Ιουδα καὶ ἐμίανεν τὰ ὑψηλά οὗ ἐθυμίασαν ἐκεῖ οἱ ἱερεῖς ἀπὸ Γαβαα καὶ ἕως Βηρσαβεε καὶ καθεῖλεν τὸν οἶκον τῶν πυλῶν τὸν παρὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς πύλης Ιησου ἄρχοντος τῆς πόλεως τῶν ἐξ ἀριστερῶν ἀνδρὸς ἐν τῇ πύλῃ τῆς πόλεως
9 πλὴν οὐκ ἀνέβησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τῶν ὑψηλῶν πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον κυρίου ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ὅτι εἰ μὴ ἔφαγον ἄζυμα ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν
10 καὶ ἐμίανεν τὸν Ταφεθ τὸν ἐν φάραγγι υἱοῦ Εννομ τοῦ διάγειν ἄνδρα τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἄνδρα τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ τῷ Μολοχ ἐν πυρί
11 καὶ κατέπαυσεν τοὺς ἵππους οὓς ἔδωκαν βασιλεῖς Ιουδα τῷ ἡλίῳ ἐν τῇ εἰσόδῳ οἴκου κυρίου εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον Ναθαν βασιλέως τοῦ εὐνούχου ἐν φαρουριμ καὶ τὸ ἅρμα τοῦ ἡλίου κατέκαυσεν πυρί
12 καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια τὰ ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος τοῦ ὑπερῴου Αχαζ ἃ ἐποίησαν βασιλεῖς Ιουδα καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια ἃ ἐποίησεν Μανασσης ἐν ταῖς δυσὶν αὐλαῖς οἴκου κυρίου καὶ καθεῖλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ κατέσπασεν ἐκεῖθεν καὶ ἔρριψεν τὸν χοῦν αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν χειμάρρουν Κεδρων
13 καὶ τὸν οἶκον τὸν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Ιερουσαλημ τὸν ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ Μοσοαθ ὃν ᾠκοδόμησεν Σαλωμων βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ τῇ Ἀστάρτῃ προσοχθίσματι Σιδωνίων καὶ τῷ Χαμως προσοχθίσματι Μωαβ καὶ τῷ Μολχολ βδελύγματι υἱῶν Αμμων ἐμίανεν ὁ βασιλεύς
14 καὶ συνέτριψεν τὰς στήλας καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσεν τὰ ἄλση καὶ ἔπλησεν τοὺς τόπους αὐτῶν ὀστέων ἀνθρώπων

15 καί γε τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ ἐν Βαιθηλ τὸ ὑψηλόν ὃ ἐποίησεν Ιεροβοαμ υἱὸς Ναβατ ὃς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ καί γε τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐκεῖνο καὶ τὸ ὑψηλὸν κατέσπασεν καὶ συνέτριψεν τοὺς λίθους αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐλέπτυνεν εἰς χοῦν καὶ κατέκαυσεν τὸ ἄλσος
16 καὶ ἐξένευσεν Ιωσιας καὶ εἶδεν τοὺς τάφους τοὺς ὄντας ἐκεῖ ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ ἀπέστειλεν καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰ ὀστᾶ ἐκ τῶν τάφων καὶ κατέκαυσεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον καὶ ἐμίανεν αὐτὸ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου ὃ ἐλάλησεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν τῷ ἑστάναι Ιεροβοαμ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον καὶ ἐπιστρέψας ἦρεν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν τάφον τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ λαλήσαντος τοὺς λόγους τούτους
17 καὶ εἶπεν τί τὸ σκόπελον ἐκεῖνο ὃ ἐγὼ ὁρῶ καὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστιν ὁ ἐξεληλυθὼς ἐξ Ιουδα καὶ ἐπικαλεσάμενος τοὺς λόγους τούτους οὓς ἐπεκαλέσατο ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον Βαιθηλ

19 καί γε εἰς πάντας τοὺς οἴκους τῶν ὑψηλῶν τοὺς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν Σαμαρείας οὓς ἐποίησαν βασιλεῖς Ισραηλ παροργίζειν κύριον ἀπέστησεν Ιωσιας καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς πάντα τὰ ἔργα ἃ ἐποίησεν ἐν Βαιθηλ
20 καὶ ἐθυσίασεν πάντας τοὺς ἱερεῖς τῶν ὑψηλῶν τοὺς ὄντας ἐκεῖ ἐπὶ τῶν θυσιαστηρίων καὶ κατέκαυσεν τὰ ὀστᾶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐ{P'} αὐτά καὶ ἐπεστράφη εἰς Ιερουσαλημ

21 καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς παντὶ τῷ λαῷ λέγων ποιήσατε τὸ πασχα τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ ἡμῶν καθὼς γέγραπται ἐπὶ βιβλίου τῆς διαθήκης ταύτης
22 ὅτι οὐκ ἐγενήθη τὸ πασχα τοῦτο ἀ{F'} ἡμερῶν τῶν κριτῶν οἳ ἔκρινον τὸν Ισραηλ καὶ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας βασιλέων Ισραηλ καὶ βασιλέων Ιουδα

27 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος καί γε τὸν Ιουδαν ἀποστήσω ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου μου καθὼς ἀπέστησα τὸν Ισραηλ καὶ ἀπώσομαι τὴν πόλιν ταύτην ἣν ἐξελεξάμην τὴν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τὸν οἶκον οὗ εἶπον ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ

28 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ιωσιου καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ιουδα
29 ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἀνέβη Φαραω Νεχαω βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου ἐπὶ βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ ποταμὸν Εὐφράτην καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ιωσιας εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτὸν Νεχαω ἐν Μαγεδδω ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν αὐτόν

36 υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν Ιωακιμ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ ἕνδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ιελδαφ θυγάτηρ Φεδεϊα ἐκ Ρουμα
37 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ
