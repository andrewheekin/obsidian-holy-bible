# Second Book of Kings 14 (RSVCE)

### Amaziah Reigns over Judah
1 In the second year of Joʹash the son of Joʹahaz, king of Israel, Amaziʹah the son of Joʹash, king of Judah, began to reign.
2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jeho-adʹdin of Jerusalem.
3 And he did what was right in the eyes of theLord, yet not like David his father; he did in all things as Joʹash his father had done.
4 But the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
5 And as soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand he killed his servants who had slain the king his father.
6 But he did not put to death the children of the murderers; according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses, where theLordcommanded, “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, or the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.”
7 He killed ten thousand Eʹdomites in the Valley of Salt and took Sela by storm, and called it Jokʹthe-el, which is its name to this day.
8 Then Amaziʹah sent messengers to Jehoʹash the son of Jehoʹahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in the face.”
9 And Jehoʹash king of Israel sent word to Amaziʹah king of Judah, “A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son for a wife’; and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle.
10 You have indeed smitten Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your glory, and stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?”
11 But Amaziʹah would not listen. So Jehoʹash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziʹah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-sheʹmesh, which belongs to Judah.
12 And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
13 And Jehoʹash king of Israel captured Amaziʹah king of Judah, the son of Jehoʹash, son of Ahaziʹah, at Beth-sheʹmesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits, from the Eʹphraim Gate to the Corner Gate.
14 And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of theLordand in the treasuries of the king’s house, also hostages, and he returned to Samarʹia.
15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoʹash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziʹah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
16 And Jehoʹash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samarʹia with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboʹam his son reigned in his stead.
17 Amaziʹah the son of Joʹash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoʹash son of Jehoʹahaz, king of Israel.
18 Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziʹah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
19 And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
20 And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
21 And all the people of Judah took Azariʹah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziʹah.
22 He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
### Jeroboam II Reigns over Israel
23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziʹah the son of Joʹash, king of Judah, Jeroboʹam the son of Joʹash, king of Israel, began to reign in Samarʹia, and he reigned forty-one years.
24 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
25 He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of theLord, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the son of Amitʹtai, the prophet, who was from Gath-heʹpher.
26 For theLordsaw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter, for there was none left, bond or free, and there was none to help Israel.
27 But theLordhad not said that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, so he saved them by the hand of Jeroboʹam the son of Joʹash.
28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboʹam, and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he recovered for Israel Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
29 And Jeroboʹam slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel, and Zechariʹah his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Regum Quartus, Secundum Hebraeos Secundus Malachim 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In anno secundo Joas filii Joachaz regis Israël, regnavit Amasias filius Joas regis Juda.
2 Viginti quinque annorum erat cum regnare cœpisset: viginti autem et novem annis regnavit in Jerusalem. Nomen matris ejus Joadan de Jerusalem.
3 Et fecit rectum coram Domino, verumtamen non ut David pater ejus. Juxta omnia quæ fecit Joas pater suus, fecit:
4 nisi hoc tantum, quod excelsa non abstulit: adhuc enim populus immolabat, et adolebat incensum in excelsis.
5 Cumque obtinuisset regnum, percussit servos suos, qui interfecerant regem patrem suum:
6 filios autem eorum qui occiderant, non occidit, juxta quod scriptum est in libro legis Moysi, sicut præcepit Dominus, dicens: Non morientur patres pro filiis, neque filii morientur pro patribus: sed unusquisque in peccato suo morietur.
7 Ipse percussit Edom in valle Salinarum decem millia, et apprehendit petram in prælio, vocavitque nomen ejus Jectehel usque in præsentem diem.

8 Tunc misit Amasias nuntios ad Joas filium Joachaz filii Jehu regis Israël, dicens: Veni, et videamus nos.
9 Remisitque Joas rex Israël ad Amasiam regem Juda, dicens: Carduus Libani misit ad cedrum quæ est in Libano, dicens: Da filiam tuam filio meo uxorem. Transieruntque bestiæ saltus quæ sunt in Libano, et conculcaverunt carduum.
10 Percutiens invaluisti super Edom, et sublevavit te cor tuum: contentus esto gloria, et sede in domo tua: quare provocas malum, ut cadas tu et Judas tecum?
11 Et non acquievit Amasias. Ascenditque Joas rex Israël, et viderunt se, ipse et Amasias rex Juda, in Bethsames oppido Judæ.
12 Percussusque est Juda coram Israël, et fugerunt unusquisque in tabernacula sua.
13 Amasiam vero regem Juda, filium Joas filii Ochoziæ, cepit Joas rex Israël in Bethsames, et adduxit eum in Jerusalem: et interrupit murum Jerusalem, a porta Ephraim usque ad portam anguli, quadringentis cubitis.
14 Tulitque omne aurum et argentum, et universa vasa quæ inventa sunt in domo Domini et in thesauris regis, et obsides, et reversus est in Samariam.

15 Reliqua autem verborum Joas quæ fecit, et fortitudo ejus qua pugnavit contra Amasiam regem Juda, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Israël?
16 Dormivitque Joas cum patribus suis, et sepultus est in Samaria cum regibus Israël, et regnavit Jeroboam filius ejus pro eo.
17 Vixit autem Amasias filius Joas rex Juda postquam mortuus est Joas filius Joachaz regis Israël, quindecim annis.
18 Reliqua autem sermonum Amasiæ, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Juda?
19 Factaque est contra eum conjuratio in Jerusalem: at ille fugit in Lachis. Miseruntque post eum in Lachis, et interfecerunt eum ibi:
20 et asportaverunt in equis, sepultusque est in Jerusalem cum patribus suis in civitate David.
21 Tulit autem universus populus Judæ Azariam annos natum sedecim, et constituerunt eum regem pro patre ejus Amasia.
22 Ipse ædificavit Ælath, et restituit eam Judæ, postquam dormivit rex cum patribus suis.

23 Anno quintodecimo Amasiæ filii Joas regis Juda, regnavit Jeroboam filius Joas regis Israël in Samaria, quadraginta et uno anno.
24 Et fecit quod malum est coram Domino: non recessit ab omnibus peccatis Jeroboam filii Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël.
25 Ipse restituit terminos Israël ab introitu Emath usque ad mare solitudinis, juxta sermonem Domini Dei Israël quem locutus est per servum suum Jonam filium Amathi prophetam, qui erat de Geth, quæ est in Opher.
26 Vidit enim Dominus afflictionem Israël amaram nimis, et quod consumpti essent usque ad clausos carcere et extremos, et non esset qui auxiliaretur Israëli.
27 Nec locutus est Dominus ut deleret nomen Israël de sub cælo, sed salvavit eos in manu Jeroboam filii Joas.
28 Reliqua autem sermonum Jeroboam, et universa quæ fecit, et fortitudo ejus qua præliatus est, et quomodo restituit Damascum et Emath Judæ in Israël, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Israël?
29 Dormivitque Jeroboam cum patribus suis regibus Israël, et regnavit Zacharias filius ejus pro eo.


# Βασιλειῶν Δʹ 14 (Septuagint)

1 ἐν ἔτει δευτέρῳ τῷ Ιωας υἱῷ Ιωαχας βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Αμεσσιας υἱὸς Ιωας βασιλεὺς Ιουδα
2 υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν ἦν ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ εἴκοσι καὶ ἐννέα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Ιωαδιν ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ
3 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου πλὴν οὐχ ὡς Δαυιδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ιωας ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἐποίησεν
4 πλὴν τὰ ὑψηλὰ οὐκ ἐξῆρεν ἔτι ὁ λαὸς ἐθυσίαζεν καὶ ἐθυμίων ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς
5 καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε κατίσχυσεν ἡ βασιλεία ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπάταξεν τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ τοὺς πατάξαντας τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν παταξάντων οὐκ ἐθανάτωσεν καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν βιβλίῳ νόμων Μωυσῆ ὡς ἐνετείλατο κύριος λέγων οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται πατέρες ὑπὲρ υἱῶν καὶ υἱοὶ οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται ὑπὲρ πατέρων ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ ἕκαστος ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖται
7 αὐτὸς ἐπάταξεν τὸν Εδωμ ἐν Γαιμελε δέκα χιλιάδας καὶ συνέλαβε τὴν πέτραν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς Καθοηλ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης

8 τότε ἀπέστειλεν Αμεσσιας ἀγγέλους πρὸς Ιωας υἱὸν Ιωαχας υἱοῦ Ιου βασιλέως Ισραηλ λέγων δεῦρο ὀφθῶμεν προσώποις
9 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιωας βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ πρὸς Αμεσσιαν βασιλέα Ιουδα λέγων ὁ ακαν ὁ ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς τὴν κέδρον τὴν ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ λέγων δὸς τὴν θυγατέρα σου τῷ υἱῷ μου εἰς γυναῖκα καὶ διῆλθον τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ τὰ ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ καὶ συνεπάτησαν τὸν ακανα
10 τύπτων ἐπάταξας τὴν Ιδουμαίαν καὶ ἐπῆρέν σε ἡ καρδία σου ἐνδοξάσθητι καθήμενος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου καὶ ἵνα τί ἐρίζεις ἐν κακίᾳ σου καὶ πεσῇ σὺ καὶ Ιουδας μετὰ σοῦ
11 καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν Αμεσσιας καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ ὤφθησαν προσώποις αὐτὸς καὶ Αμεσσιας βασιλεὺς Ιουδα ἐν Βαιθσαμυς τῇ τοῦ Ιουδα
12 καὶ ἔπταισεν Ιουδας ἀπὸ προσώπου Ισραηλ καὶ ἔφυγεν ἀνὴρ εἰς τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ τὸν Αμεσσιαν υἱὸν Ιωας υἱοῦ Οχοζιου βασιλέα Ιουδα συνέλαβεν Ιωας υἱὸς Ιωαχας βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ ἐν Βαιθσαμυς καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ καθεῖλεν ἐν τῷ τείχει Ιερουσαλημ ἐν τῇ πύλῃ Εφραιμ ἕως πύλης τῆς γωνίας τετρακοσίους πήχεις
14 καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ εὑρεθέντα ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου καὶ ἐν θησαυροῖς οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν συμμίξεων καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς Σαμάρειαν

15 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ιωας ὅσα ἐποίησεν ἐν δυναστείᾳ αὐτοῦ ἃ ἐπολέμησεν μετὰ Αμεσσιου βασιλέως Ιουδα οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ισραηλ
16 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ιωας μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ μετὰ τῶν βασιλέων Ισραηλ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ιεροβοαμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ ἔζησεν Αμεσσιας υἱὸς Ιωας βασιλεὺς Ιουδα μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν Ιωας υἱὸν Ιωαχας βασιλέα Ισραηλ πεντεκαίδεκα ἔτη
18 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Αμεσσιου καὶ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησεν οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ιουδα
19 καὶ συνεστράφησαν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν σύστρεμμα ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἔφυγεν εἰς Λαχις καὶ ἀπέστειλαν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ εἰς Λαχις καὶ ἐθανάτωσαν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ
20 καὶ ἦραν αὐτὸν ἐ{F'} ἵππων καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν Ιερουσαλημ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ
21 καὶ ἔλαβεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς Ιουδα τὸν Αζαριαν καὶ αὐτὸς υἱὸς ἑκκαίδεκα ἐτῶν καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν αὐτὸν ἀντὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Αμεσσιου
22 αὐτὸς ᾠκοδόμησεν τὴν Αιλωθ καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτὴν τῷ Ιουδα μετὰ τὸ κοιμηθῆναι τὸν βασιλέα μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ

23 ἐν ἔτει πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ τοῦ Αμεσσιου υἱοῦ Ιωας βασιλέως Ιουδα ἐβασίλευσεν Ιεροβοαμ υἱὸς Ιωας ἐπὶ Ισραηλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ τεσσαράκοντα καὶ ἓν ἔτος
24 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον κυρίου οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ πασῶν ἁμαρτιῶν Ιεροβοαμ υἱοῦ Ναβατ ὃς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ
25 αὐτὸς ἀπέστησεν τὸ ὅριον Ισραηλ ἀπὸ εἰσόδου Αιμαθ ἕως τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς Αραβα κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ δούλου αὐτοῦ Ιωνα υἱοῦ Αμαθι τοῦ προφήτου τοῦ ἐκ Γεθχοβερ
26 ὅτι εἶδεν κύριος τὴν ταπείνωσιν Ισραηλ πικρὰν σφόδρα καὶ ὀλιγοστοὺς συνεχομένους καὶ ἐσπανισμένους καὶ ἐγκαταλελειμμένους καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ βοηθῶν τῷ Ισραηλ
27 καὶ οὐκ ἐλάλησεν κύριος ἐξαλεῖψαι τὸ σπέρμα Ισραηλ ὑποκάτωθεν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς διὰ χειρὸς Ιεροβοαμ υἱοῦ Ιωας
