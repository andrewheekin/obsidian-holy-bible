# Book of Ecclesiasticus 46 (RSVCE)

### Joshua and Caleb
1 Joshua the son of Nun was mighty in war, and was the successor of Moses in prophesying. He became, in accordance with his name, a great savior of God’stelect, to take vengeance on the enemies that rose against them, so that he might give Israel its inheritance.
2 How glorious he was when he lifted his hands and stretched out his sword against the cities!
3 Who before him ever stood so firm? For he waged the wars of the Lord.
4 Was not the sun held back by his hand? And did not one day become as long as two?
5 He called upon the Most High, the Mighty One, when enemies pressed him on every side,
6 and the great Lord answered him with hailstones of mighty power. He hurled down war upon that nation, and at the descent of Beth-horʹonuhe destroyed those who resisted, so that the nations might know his armament, that he was fighting in the sight of the Lord; for he wholly followed the Mighty One.
7 And in the days of Moses he did a loyal deed, he and Caleb the son of Jephunʹneh: they withstood the congregation,v restrained the people from sin, and stilled their wicked murmuring.
8 And these two alone were preserved out of six hundred thousand people on foot, to bring them into their inheritance, into a land flowing with milk and honey.
9 And the Lord gave Caleb strength, which remained with him to old age, so that he went up to the hill country, and his children obtained it for an inheritance;
10 so that all the sons of Israel might see that it is good to follow the Lord.
### The Judges
11 The judges also, with their respective names, those whose hearts did not fall into idolatry and who did not turn away from the Lord— may their memory be blessed!
12 May their bones revive from where they lie, and may the name of those who have been honored live again in their sons!
13 Samuel, beloved by his Lord, a prophet of the Lord, established the kingdom and anointed rulers over his people.
14 By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, and the Lord watched over Jacob.
15 By his faithfulness he was proved to be a prophet, and by his words he became known as a trustworthy seer.
16 He called upon the Lord, the Mighty One, when his enemies pressed him on every side, and he offered in sacrifice a sucking lamb.
17 Then the Lord thundered from heaven, and made his voice heard with a mighty sound;
18 and he wiped out the leaders of the people of Tyre and all the rulers of the Philistines.
19 Before the time of his eternal sleep, Samuelwcalled men to witness before the Lord and his anointed: “I have not taken any one’s property, not so much as a pair of shoes.” And no man accused him.
20 Even after he had fallen asleep he prophesied and revealed to the king his death, and lifted up his voice out of the earth in prophecy, to blot out the wickedness of the people.


# Liber Ecclesiastici 46 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Fortis in bello Jesus Nave, successor Moysi in prophetis,qui fuit magnus secundum nomen suum,
2 maximus in salutem electorum Dei,expugnare insurgentes hostes,ut consequeretur hæreditatem Israël.
3 Quam gloriam adeptus est in tollendo manus suas,et jactando contra civitates rhomphæas!
4 Quis ante illum sic restitit?nam hostes ipse Dominus perduxit.
5 An non in iracundia ejus impeditus est sol,et una dies facta est quasi duo?
6 Invocavit Altissimum potentem,in oppugnando inimicos undique:et audivit illum magnus et sanctus Deus,in saxis grandinis virtutis valde fortis.
7 Impetum fecit contra gentem hostilem,et in descensu perdidit contrarios:
8 ut cognoscant gentes potentiam ejus,quia contra Deum pugnare non est facile.Et secutus est a tergo potentis:
9 et in diebus Moysi misericordiam fecit,ipse, et Caleb filius Jephone,stare contra hostem, et prohibere gentem a peccatis,et perfringere murmur malitiæ.
10 Et ipsi duo constituti a periculo liberati sunta numero sexcentorum millium peditum,inducere illos in hæreditatem,in terram quæ manat lac et mel.

11 Et dedit Dominus ipsi Caleb fortitudinem,et usque in senectutem permansit illi virtus,ut ascenderet in excelsum terræ locum,et semen ipsius obtinuit hæreditatem,
12 ut viderent omnes filii Israëlquia bonum est obsequi sancto Deo.
13 Et judices singuli suo nomine, quorum non est corruptum cor,qui non aversi sunt a Domino,
14 ut sit memoria illorum in benedictione,et ossa eorum pullulent de loco suo:
15 et nomen eorum permaneat in æternum,permanens ad filios illorum, sanctorum virorum gloria.

16 Dilectus a Domino Deo suo Samuel, propheta Domini,renovavit imperium,et unxit principes in gente sua.
17 In lege Domini congregationem judicavit,et vidit Deus Jacob:et in fide sua probatus est propheta,
18 et cognitus est in verbis suis fidelis,quia vidit Deum lucis.
19 Et invocavit Dominum omnipotentem,in oppugnando hostes circumstantes undique,in oblatione agni inviolati.
20 Et intonuit de cælo Dominus,et in sonitu magno auditam fecit vocem suam:
21 et contrivit principes Tyriorum,et omnes duces Philisthiim:
22 et ante tempus finis vitæ suæ et sæculi,testimonium præbuit in conspectu Domini et christi:pecunias et usque ad calceamenta ab omni carne non accepit,et non accusavit illum homo.
23 Et post hoc dormivit: et notum fecit regi,et ostendit illi finem vitæ suæ:et exaltavit vocem suam de terra in prophetia,delere impietatem gentis.


# Σοφία Σειράχ 46 (Septuagint)

1 κραταιὸς ἐν πολέμῳ Ἰησοῦς Ναυη καὶ διάδοχος Μωυσῆ ἐν προφητείαις ὃς ἐγένετο κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ
2 μέγας ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ ἐκδικῆσαι ἐπεγειρομένους ἐχθρούς ὅπως κατακληρονομήσῃ τὸν Ισραηλ
3 ὡς ἐδοξάσθη ἐν τῷ ἐπᾶραι χεῖρας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐκτεῖναι ῥομφαίαν ἐπὶ πόλεις
4 τίς πρότερος αὐτοῦ οὕτως ἔστη τοὺς γὰρ πολέμους κυρίου αὐτὸς ἐπήγαγεν
5 οὐχὶ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἐνεποδίσθη ὁ ἥλιος καὶ μία ἡμέρα ἐγενήθη πρὸς δύο
6 ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν ὕψιστον δυνάστην ἐν τῷ θλῖψαι αὐτὸν ἐχθροὺς κυκλόθεν καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ μέγας κύριος ἐν λίθοις χαλάζης δυνάμεως κραταιᾶς
7 κατέρραξεν ἐ{P'} ἔθνος πόλεμον καὶ ἐν καταβάσει ἀπώλεσεν ἀνθεστηκότας
8 ἵνα γνῶσιν ἔθνη πανοπλίαν αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐναντίον κυρίου ὁ πόλεμος αὐτοῦ
9 καὶ γὰρ ἐπηκολούθησεν ὀπίσω δυνάστου καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις Μωυσέως ἐποίησεν ἔλεος αὐτὸς καὶ Χαλεβ υἱὸς Ιεφοννη ἀντιστῆναι ἔναντι ἐκκλησίας κωλῦσαι λαὸν ἀπὸ ἁμαρτίας καὶ κοπάσαι γογγυσμὸν πονηρίας
10 καὶ αὐτοὶ δύο ὄντες διεσώθησαν ἀπὸ ἑξακοσίων χιλιάδων πεζῶν εἰσαγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς κληρονομίαν εἰς γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι

11 καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ κύριος τῷ Χαλεβ ἰσχύν καὶ ἕως γήρους διέμεινεν αὐτῷ ἐπιβῆναι αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ὕψος τῆς γῆς καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ κατέσχεν κληρονομίαν
12 ὅπως ἴδωσιν πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ὅτι καλὸν τὸ πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω κυρίου
13 καὶ οἱ κριταί ἕκαστος τῷ αὐτοῦ ὀνόματι ὅσων οὐκ ἐξεπόρνευσεν ἡ καρδία καὶ ὅσοι οὐκ ἀπεστράφησαν ἀπὸ κυρίου
14 εἴη τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν ἐν εὐλογίαις τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν ἀναθάλοι ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν
15 καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν ἀντικαταλλασσόμενον ἐ{F'} υἱοῖς δεδοξασμένων αὐτῶν

16 ἠγαπημένος ὑπὸ κυρίου αὐτοῦ Σαμουηλ προφήτης κυρίου κατέστησεν βασιλείαν καὶ ἔχρισεν ἄρχοντας ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ
17 ἐν νόμῳ κυρίου ἔκρινεν συναγωγήν καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο κύριος τὸν Ιακωβ
18 ἐν πίστει αὐτοῦ ἠκριβάσθη προφήτης καὶ ἐγνώσθη ἐν ῥήμασιν αὐτοῦ πιστὸς ὁράσεως
19 καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν κύριον δυνάστην ἐν τῷ θλῖψαι ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ κυκλόθεν ἐν προσφορᾷ ἀρνὸς γαλαθηνοῦ
20 καὶ ἐβρόντησεν ἀ{P'} οὐρανοῦ ὁ κύριος καὶ ἐν ἤχῳ μεγάλῳ ἀκουστὴν ἐποίησεν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ
21 καὶ ἐξέτριψεν ἡγουμένους Τυρίων καὶ πάντας ἄρχοντας Φυλιστιιμ
22 καὶ πρὸ καιροῦ κοιμήσεως αἰῶνος ἐπεμαρτύρατο ἔναντι κυρίου καὶ χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ χρήματα καὶ ἕως ὑποδημάτων ἀπὸ πάσης σαρκὸς οὐκ εἴληφα καὶ οὐκ ἐνεκάλεσεν αὐτῷ ἄνθρωπος
23 καὶ μετὰ τὸ ὑπνῶσαι αὐτὸν προεφήτευσεν καὶ ὑπέδειξεν βασιλεῖ τὴν τελευτὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνύψωσεν ἐκ γῆς τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν προφητείᾳ ἐξαλεῖψαι ἀνομίαν λαοῦ
