# Book of Ecclesiasticus 38 (RSVCE)

### Concerning Physicians and Health
1 Honor the physician with the honor due him, according to your need of him, for the Lord created him;
2 for healing comes from the Most High, and he will receive a gift from the king.
3 The skill of the physician lifts up his head, and in the presence of great men he is admired.
4 The Lord created medicines from the earth, and a sensible man will not despise them.
5 Was not water made sweet with a tree in order that hisgpower might be known?
6 And he gave skill to men that hehmight be glorified in his marvelous works.
7 By them he heals and takes away pain;
8 the pharmacist makes of them a compound. His works will never be finished; and from him healthiis upon the face of the earth.
9 My son, when you are sick do not be negligent, but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you.
10 Give up your faults and direct your hands aright, and cleanse your heart from all sin.
11 Offer a sweet-smelling sacrifice, and a memorial portion of fine flour, and pour oil on your offering, as much as you can afford.j
12 And give the physician his place, for the Lord created him; let him not leave you, for there is need of him.
13 There is a time when success lies in the hands of physicians,
14 for they too will pray to the Lord that he should grant them success in diagnosisl and in healing, for the sake of preserving life.
15 He who sins before his Maker, may he fall into the caremof a physician.
### On Mourning for the Dead
16 My son, let your tears fall for the dead, and as one who is suffering grievously begin the lament. Lay out his body with the honor due him, and do not neglect his burial.
17 Let your weeping be bitter and your wailing fervent; observe the mourning according to his merit, for one day, or two, to avoid criticism; then be comforted for your sorrow.
18 For sorrow results in death, and sorrow of heart saps one’s strength.
19 In calamity sorrow continues, and the life of the poor man weighs down his heart.
20 Do not give your heart to sorrow; drive it away, remembering the end of life.
21 Do not forget, there is no coming back; you do the deadnno good, and you injure yourself.
22 “Remember my doom, for yours is like it: yesterday it was mine, and today it is yours.”
23 When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance cease, and be comforted for him when his spirit has departed.
### Trades and Crafts
24 The wisdom of the scribe depends on the opportunity of leisure; and he who has little business may become wise.
25 How can he become wise who handles the plow, and who glories in the shaft of a goad, who drives oxen and is occupied with their work, and whose talk is aboutobulls?
26 He sets his heart on plowing furrows, and he is careful about fodder for the heifers.
27 So too is every craftsman and master workman who labors by night as well as by day; those who cut the signets of seals, each is diligent in making a great variety; he sets his heart on painting a lifelike image, and he is careful to finish his work.
28 So too is the smith sitting by the anvil, intent upon his handiwork in iron; the breath of the fire melts his flesh, and he wastes away inpthe heat of the furnace; he inclines his ear to the sound of the hammer,q and his eyes are on the pattern of the object. He sets his heart on finishing his handiwork, and he is careful to complete its decoration.
29 So too is the potter sitting at his work and turning the wheel with his feet; he is always deeply concerned over his work, and all his output is by number.
30 He moulds the clay with his arm and makes it pliable with his feet; he sets his heart to finish the glazing, and he is careful to clean the furnace.
31 All these rely upon their hands, and each is skilful in his own work.
32 Without them a city cannot be established, and men can neither sojourn nor live there.
33 Yet they are not sought out for the council of the people, nor do they attain eminence in the public assembly. They do not sit in the judge’s seat, nor do they understand the sentence of judgment; they cannot expound discipline or judgment, and they are not found using proverbs.
34 But they keep stable the fabric of the world, and their prayer is in the practice of their trade.


# Liber Ecclesiastici 38 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Honora medicum propter necessitatem:etenim illum creavit Altissimus.
2 A Deo est enim omnis medela,et a rege accipiet donationem.
3 Disciplina medici exaltabit caput illius,et in conspectu magnatorum collaudabitur.
4 Altissimus creavit de terra medicamenta,et vir prudens non abhorrebit illa.
5 Nonne a ligno indulcata est aqua amara?
6 Ad agnitionem hominum virtus illorum:et dedit hominibus scientiam Altissimus,honorari in mirabilibus suis.
7 In his curans mitigabit dolorem:et unguentarius faciet pigmenta suavitatis,et unctiones conficiet sanitatis:et non consummabuntur opera ejus.
8 Pax enim Dei super faciem terræ.

9 Fili, in tua infirmitate ne despicias teipsum:sed ora Dominum, et ipse curabit te.
10 Averte a delicto, et dirige manus,et ab omni delicto munda cor tuum.
11 Da suavitatem et memoriam similaginis,et impingua oblationem, et da locum medico:
12 etenim illum Dominus creavit, et non discedat a te,quia opera ejus sunt necessaria.
13 Est enim tempus quando in manus illorum incurras:
14 ipsi vero Dominum deprecabuntur, ut dirigat requiem eorum,et sanitatem, propter conversationem illorum.
15 Qui delinquit in conspectu ejus qui fecit eum,incidet in manus medici.

16 Fili, in mortuum produc lacrimas,et quasi dira passus incipe plorare:et secundum judicium contege corpus illius,et non despicias sepulturam illius.
17 Propter delaturam autem amare fer luctum illius uno die,et consolare propter tristitiam:
18 et fac luctum secundum meritum ejusuno die, vel duobus, propter detractionem:
19 a tristitia enim festinat mors, et cooperit virtutem,et tristitia cordis flectit cervicem.
20 In abductione permanet tristitia,et substantia inopis secundum cor ejus.
21 Ne dederis in tristitia cor tuum,sed repelle eam a te, et memento novissimorum.
22 Noli oblivisci, neque enim est conversio:et huic nihil proderis, et teipsum pessimabis.
23 Memor esto judicii mei: sic enim erit et tuum:mihi heri, et tibi hodie.
24 In requie mortui requiescere fac memoriam ejus,et consolare illum in exitu spiritus sui.

25 Sapientia scribæ in tempore vacuitatis,et qui minoratur actu sapientiam percipiet,qua sapientia replebitur.
26 Qui tenet aratrum,et qui gloriatur in jaculo, stimulo boves agitat,et conversatur in operibus eorum,et enarratio ejus in filiis taurorum.
27 Cor suum dabit ad versandos sulcos,et vigilia ejus in sagina vaccarum.
28 Sic omnis faber et architectus,qui noctem tamquam diem transigit:qui sculpit signacula sculptilia,et assiduitas ejus variat picturam:cor suum dabit in similitudinem picturæ,et vigilia sua perficiet opus.
29 Sic faber ferrarius sedens juxta incudem,et considerans opus ferri:vapor ignis uret carnes ejus,et in calore fornacis concertatur.
30 Vox mallei innovat aurem ejus,et contra similitudinem vasis oculus ejus.
31 Cor suum dabit in consummationem operum,et vigilia sua ornabit in perfectionem.
32 Sic figulus sedens ad opus suum,convertens pedibus suis rotam,qui in sollicitudine positus est semper propter opus suum,et in numero est omnis operatio ejus.
33 In brachio suo formabit lutum,et ante pedes suos curvabit virtutem suam.
34 Cor suum dabit ut consummet linitionem,et vigilia sua mundabit fornacem.
35 Omnes hi in manibus suis speraverunt,et unusquisque in arte sua sapiens est.
36 Sine his omnibus non ædificatur civitas,
37 et non inhabitabunt, nec inambulabunt,et in ecclesiam non transilient.
38 Super sellam judicis non sedebunt,et testamentum judicii non intelligent,neque palam facient disciplinam et judicium,et in parabolis non invenientur:
39 sed creaturam ævi confirmabunt:et deprecatio illorum in operatione artis,accomodantes animam suam,et conquirentes in lege Altissimi.


# Σοφία Σειράχ 38 (Septuagint)

1 τίμα ἰατρὸν πρὸς τὰς χρείας αὐτοῦ τιμαῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸν ἔκτισεν κύριος
2 παρὰ γὰρ ὑψίστου ἐστὶν ἴασις καὶ παρὰ βασιλέως λήμψεται δόμα
3 ἐπιστήμη ἰατροῦ ἀνυψώσει κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔναντι μεγιστάνων θαυμασθήσεται
4 κύριος ἔκτισεν ἐκ γῆς φάρμακα καὶ ἀνὴρ φρόνιμος οὐ προσοχθιεῖ αὐτοῖς
5 οὐκ ἀπὸ ξύλου ἐγλυκάνθη ὕδωρ εἰς τὸ γνωσθῆναι τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ αὐτὸς ἔδωκεν ἀνθρώποις ἐπιστήμην ἐνδοξάζεσθαι ἐν τοῖς θαυμασίοις αὐτοῦ
7 ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐθεράπευσεν καὶ ἦρεν τὸν πόνον αὐτοῦ μυρεψὸς ἐν τούτοις ποιήσει μεῖγμα καὶ οὐ μὴ συντελεσθῇ ἔργα αὐτοῦ
8 καὶ εἰρήνη πα{R'} αὐτοῦ ἐστιν ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς

9 τέκνον ἐν ἀρρωστήματί σου μὴ παράβλεπε ἀλ{L'} εὖξαι κυρίῳ καὶ αὐτὸς ἰάσεταί σε
10 ἀπόστησον πλημμέλειαν καὶ εὔθυνον χεῖρας καὶ ἀπὸ πάσης ἁμαρτίας καθάρισον καρδίαν
11 δὸς εὐωδίαν καὶ μνημόσυνον σεμιδάλεως καὶ λίπανον προσφορὰν ὡς μὴ ὑπάρχων
12 καὶ ἰατρῷ δὸς τόπον καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸν ἔκτισεν κύριος καὶ μὴ ἀποστήτω σου καὶ γὰρ αὐτοῦ χρεία
13 ἔστιν καιρὸς ὅτε καὶ ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν εὐοδία
14 καὶ γὰρ αὐτοὶ κυρίου δεηθήσονται ἵνα εὐοδώσῃ αὐτοῖς ἀνάπαυσιν καὶ ἴασιν χάριν ἐμβιώσεως
15 ὁ ἁμαρτάνων ἔναντι τοῦ ποιήσαντος αὐτὸν ἐμπέσοι εἰς χεῖρας ἰατροῦ

16 τέκνον ἐπὶ νεκρῷ κατάγαγε δάκρυα καὶ ὡς δεινὰ πάσχων ἔναρξαι θρήνου κατὰ δὲ τὴν κρίσιν αὐτοῦ περίστειλον τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ καὶ μὴ ὑπερίδῃς τὴν ταφὴν αὐτοῦ
17 πίκρανον κλαυθμὸν καὶ θέρμανον κοπετὸν
18 καὶ ποίησον τὸ πένθος κατὰ τὴν ἀξίαν αὐτοῦ ἡμέραν μίαν καὶ δύο χάριν διαβολῆς καὶ παρακλήθητι λύπης ἕνεκα
19 ἀπὸ λύπης γὰρ ἐκβαίνει θάνατος καὶ λύπη καρδίας κάμψει ἰσχύν
20 ἐν ἐπαγωγῇ παραμένει καὶ λύπη καὶ βίος πτωχοῦ κατὰ καρδίας
21 μὴ δῷς εἰς λύπην τὴν καρδίαν σου ἀπόστησον αὐτὴν μνησθεὶς τὰ ἔσχατα
22 μὴ ἐπιλάθῃ οὐ γάρ ἐστιν ἐπάνοδος καὶ τοῦτον οὐκ ὠφελήσεις καὶ σεαυτὸν κακώσεις
23 μνήσθητι τὸ κρίμα μου ὅτι οὕτως καὶ τὸ σόν ἐμοὶ ἐχθὲς καὶ σοὶ σήμερον
24 ἐν ἀναπαύσει νεκροῦ κατάπαυσον τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτοῦ καὶ παρακλήθητι ἐν αὐτῷ ἐν ἐξόδῳ πνεύματος αὐτοῦ

25 σοφία γραμματέως ἐν εὐκαιρίᾳ σχολῆς καὶ ὁ ἐλασσούμενος πράξει αὐτοῦ σοφισθήσεται
26 τί σοφισθήσεται ὁ κρατῶν ἀρότρου καὶ καυχώμενος ἐν δόρατι κέντρου βόας ἐλαύνων καὶ ἀναστρεφόμενος ἐν ἔργοις αὐτῶν καὶ ἡ διήγησις αὐτοῦ ἐν υἱοῖς ταύρων
27 καρδίαν αὐτοῦ δώσει ἐκδοῦναι αὔλακας καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία αὐτοῦ εἰς χορτάσματα δαμάλεων
28 οὕτως πᾶς τέκτων καὶ ἀρχιτέκτων ὅστις νύκτωρ ὡς ἡμέρας διάγει οἱ γλύφοντες γλύμματα σφραγίδων καὶ ἡ ἐπιμονὴ αὐτοῦ ἀλλοιῶσαι ποικιλίαν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ δώσει εἰς ὁμοιῶσαι ζωγραφίαν καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία αὐτοῦ τελέσαι ἔργον
29 οὕτως χαλκεὺς καθήμενος ἐγγὺς ἄκμονος καὶ καταμανθάνων ἔργα σιδήρου ἀτμὶς πυρὸς τήξει σάρκας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν θέρμῃ καμίνου διαμαχήσεται
30 φωνῇ σφύρης κλινεῖ τὸ οὖς αὐτοῦ καὶ κατέναντι ὁμοιώματος σκεύους οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ
31 καρδίαν αὐτοῦ δώσει εἰς συντέλειαν ἔργων καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία αὐτοῦ κοσμῆσαι ἐπὶ συντελείας
32 οὕτως κεραμεὺς καθήμενος ἐν ἔργῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ συστρέφων ἐν ποσὶν αὐτοῦ τροχόν ὃς ἐν μερίμνῃ κεῖται διὰ παντὸς ἐπὶ τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐναρίθμιος πᾶσα ἡ ἐργασία αὐτοῦ
33 ἐν βραχίονι αὐτοῦ τυπώσει πηλὸν καὶ πρὸ ποδῶν κάμψει ἰσχὺν αὐτοῦ
34 καρδίαν ἐπιδώσει συντελέσαι τὸ χρῖσμα καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία αὐτοῦ καθαρίσαι κάμινον
35 πάντες οὗτοι εἰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐνεπίστευσαν καὶ ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ αὐτοῦ σοφίζεται
36 ἄνευ αὐτῶν οὐκ οἰκισθήσεται πόλις
37 καὶ οὐ παροικήσουσιν οὐδὲ περιπατήσουσιν καὶ ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ οὐχ ὑπεραλοῦνται
38 ἐπὶ δίφρον δικαστοῦ οὐ καθιοῦνται καὶ διαθήκην κρίματος οὐ διανοηθήσονται οὐδὲ μὴ ἐκφάνωσιν παιδείαν καὶ κρίμα καὶ ἐν παραβολαῖς οὐχ εὑρεθήσονται
39 ἀλλὰ κτίσμα αἰῶνος στηρίσουσιν καὶ ἡ δέησις αὐτῶν ἐν ἐργασίᾳ τέχνης πλὴν τοῦ ἐπιδιδόντος τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ διανοουμένου ἐν νόμῳ ὑψίστου
