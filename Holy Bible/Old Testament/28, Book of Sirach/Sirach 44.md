# Book of Ecclesiasticus 44 (RSVCE)

1 Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers in their generations.
2 The Lord apportioned to them great glory, his majesty from the beginning.
3 There were those who ruled in their kingdoms, and were men renowned for their power, giving counsel by their understanding, and proclaiming prophecies;
4 leaders of the people in their deliberations and in understanding of learning for the people, wise in their words of instruction;
5 those who composed musical tunes, and set forth verses in writing;
6 rich men furnished with resources, living peaceably in their habitations—
7 all these were honored in their generations, and were the glory of their times.
8 There are some of them who have left a name, so that men declare their praise.
9 And there are some who have no memorial, who have perished as though they had not lived; they have become as though they had not been born, and so have their children after them.
10 But these were men of mercy, whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten;
11 their prosperity will remain with their descendants, and their inheritance to their children’s children.g
12 Their descendants stand by the covenants; their children also, for their sake.
13 Their posterity will continue for ever, and their glory will not be blotted out.
14 Their bodies were buried in peace, and their name lives to all generations.
15 Peoples will declare their wisdom, and the congregation proclaims their praise.
### Enoch
16 Enoch pleased the Lord, and was taken up; he was an example of repentance to all generations.
### Noah
17 Noah was found perfect and righteous; in the time of wrath he was taken in exchange; therefore a remnant was left to the earth when the flood came.
18 Everlasting covenants were made with him that all flesh should not be blotted out by a flood.
### Abraham
19 Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations, and no one has been found like him in glory;
20 he kept the law of the Most High, and was taken into covenant with him; he established the covenant in his flesh, and when he was tested he was found faithful.
21 Therefore the Lord assured him by an oath that the nations would be blessed through his posterity; that he would multiply him like the dust of the earth, and exalt his posterity like the stars, and cause them to inherit from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.
### Isaac and Jacob
22 To Isaac also he gave the same assurance for the sake of Abraham his father.
23 The blessing of all men and the covenant he made to rest upon the head of Jacob; he acknowledged him with his blessings, and gave him his inheritance;i he determined his portions, and distributed them among twelve tribes.


# Liber Ecclesiastici 44 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Laudemus viros gloriosos,et parentes nostros in generatione sua.
2 Multam gloriam fecit Dominus:magnificentia sua a sæculo.
3 Dominantes in potestatibus suis,homines magni virtute et prudentia sua præditi,nuntiantes in prophetis dignitatem prophetarum:
4 et imperantes in præsenti populo,et virtute prudentiæ populis sanctissima verba:
5 in peritia sua requirentes modos musicos,et narrantes carmina Scripturarum:
6 homines divites in virtute,pulchritudinis studium habentes,pacificantes in domibus suis.
7 Omnes isti in generationibus gentis suæ gloriam adepti sunt,et in diebus suis habentur in laudibus.
8 Qui de illis nati sunt reliquerunt nomennarrandi laudes eorum.
9 Et sunt quorum non est memoria:perierunt quasi qui non fuerint:et nati sunt quasi non nati,et filii ipsorum cum ipsis.
10 Sed illi viri misericordiæ sunt,quorum pietates non defuerunt.
11 Cum semine eorum permanent bona:
12 hæreditas sancta nepotes eorum,et in testamentis stetit semen eorum:
13 et filii eorum propter illos usque in æternum manent:semen eorum et gloria eorum non derelinquetur.
14 Corpora ipsorum in pace sepulta sunt,et nomen eorum vivit in generationem et generationem.
15 Sapientiam ipsorum narrent populi,et laudem eorum nuntiet ecclesia.

16 Enoch placuit Deo, et translatus est in paradisum,ut det gentibus pœnitentiam.
17 Noë inventus est perfectus, justus,et in tempore iracundiæ factus est reconciliatio.
18 Ideo dimissum est reliquum terræ,cum factum est diluvium.
19 Testamenta sæculi posita sunt apud illum,ne deleri possit diluvio omnis caro.
20 Abraham magnus pater multitudinis gentium,et non est inventus similis illi in gloria:qui conservavit legem Excelsi,et fuit in testamento cum illo.
21 In carne ejus stare fecit testamentum,et in tentatione inventus est fidelis.
22 Ideo jurejurando dedit illi gloriam in gente sua,crescere illum quasi terræ cumulum,
23 et ut stellas exaltare semen ejus,et hæreditare illos a mari usque ad mare,et a flumine usque ad terminos terræ.
24 Et in Isaac eodem modo fecit,propter Abraham patrem ejus.
25 Benedictionem omnium gentium dedit illi Dominus,et testamentum confirmavit super caput Jacob.
26 Agnovit eum in benedictionibus suis,et dedit illi hæreditatem,et divisit illi partem in tribubus duodecim.

27 Et conservavit illi homines misericordiæ,invenientes gratiam in oculis omnis carnis.

1 αἰνέσωμεν δὴ ἄνδρας ἐνδόξους καὶ τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν τῇ γενέσει
2 πολλὴν δόξαν ἔκτισεν ὁ κύριος τὴν μεγαλωσύνην αὐτοῦ ἀ{P'} αἰῶνος
3 κυριεύοντες ἐν ταῖς βασιλείαις αὐτῶν καὶ ἄνδρες ὀνομαστοὶ ἐν δυνάμει βουλεύοντες ἐν συνέσει αὐτῶν ἀπηγγελκότες ἐν προφητείαις
4 ἡγούμενοι λαοῦ ἐν διαβουλίοις καὶ συνέσει γραμματείας λαοῦ
5 σοφοὶ λόγοι ἐν παιδείᾳ αὐτῶν ἐκζητοῦντες μέλη μουσικῶν καὶ διηγούμενοι ἔπη ἐν γραφῇ
6 ἄνδρες πλούσιοι κεχορηγημένοι ἰσχύι εἰρηνεύοντες ἐν κατοικίαις αὐτῶν
7 πάντες οὗτοι ἐν γενεαῖς ἐδοξάσθησαν καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν καύχημα
8 εἰσὶν αὐτῶν οἳ κατέλιπον ὄνομα τοῦ ἐκδιηγήσασθαι ἐπαίνους
9 καὶ εἰσὶν ὧν οὐκ ἔστιν μνημόσυνον καὶ ἀπώλοντο ὡς οὐχ ὑπάρξαντες καὶ ἐγένοντο ὡς οὐ γεγονότες καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν με{T'} αὐτούς
10 ἀλ{L'} ἢ οὗτοι ἄνδρες ἐλέους ὧν αἱ δικαιοσύναι οὐκ ἐπελήσθησαν
11 μετὰ τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτῶν διαμενεῖ
12 ἀγαθὴ κληρονομία ἔκγονα αὐτῶν ἐν ταῖς διαθήκαις ἔστη τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν
13 καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν δ{I'} αὐτούς ἕως αἰῶνος μενεῖ σπέρμα αὐτῶν καὶ ἡ δόξα αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐξαλειφθήσεται
14 τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἐτάφη καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν ζῇ εἰς γενεάς
15 σοφίαν αὐτῶν διηγήσονται λαοί καὶ τὸν ἔπαινον ἐξαγγέλλει ἐκκλησία

16 Ενωχ εὐηρέστησεν κυρίῳ καὶ μετετέθη ὑπόδειγμα μετανοίας ταῖς γενεαῖς
17 Νωε εὑρέθη τέλειος δίκαιος ἐν καιρῷ ὀργῆς ἐγένετο ἀντάλλαγμα
18 διὰ τοῦτον ἐγενήθη κατάλειμμα τῇ γῇ ὅτε ἐγένετο κατακλυσμός
19 διαθῆκαι αἰῶνος ἐτέθησαν πρὸς αὐτόν ἵνα μὴ ἐξαλειφθῇ κατακλυσμῷ πᾶσα σάρξ
20 Αβρααμ μέγας πατὴρ πλήθους ἐθνῶν καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη ὅμοιος ἐν τῇ δόξῃ ὃς συνετήρησεν νόμον ὑψίστου καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν διαθήκῃ με{T'} αὐτοῦ
21 ἐν σαρκὶ αὐτοῦ ἔστησεν διαθήκην καὶ ἐν πειρασμῷ εὑρέθη πιστός
22 διὰ τοῦτο ἐν ὅρκῳ ἔστησεν αὐτῷ ἐνευλογηθῆναι ἔθνη ἐν σπέρματι αὐτοῦ πληθῦναι αὐτὸν ὡς χοῦν τῆς γῆς
23 καὶ ὡς ἄστρα ἀνυψῶσαι τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ καὶ κατακληρονομῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἕως θαλάσσης καὶ ἀπὸ ποταμοῦ ἕως ἄκρου τῆς γῆς
24 καὶ ἐν τῷ Ισαακ ἔστησεν οὕτως δ{I'} Αβρααμ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ
25 εὐλογίαν πάντων ἀνθρώπων καὶ διαθήκην κατέπαυσεν ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν Ιακωβ
26 ἐπέγνω αὐτὸν ἐν εὐλογίαις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ἐν κληρονομίᾳ καὶ διέστειλεν μερίδας αὐτοῦ ἐν φυλαῖς ἐμέρισεν δέκα δύο

27 καὶ ἐξήγαγεν ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἄνδρα ἐλέους εὑρίσκοντα χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς πάσης σαρκὸς
