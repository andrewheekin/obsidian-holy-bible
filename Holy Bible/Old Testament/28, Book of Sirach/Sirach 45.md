# Book of Ecclesiasticus 45 (RSVCE)

### Moses
1 From his descendants the Lord brought forth a man of mercy, who found favor in the sight of all flesh and was beloved by God and man, Moses, whose memory is blessed.
2 He made him equal in glory to the holy ones, and made him great in the fears of his enemies.
3 By his words he caused signs to cease; the Lordkglorified him in the presence of kings. He gave him commands for his people, and showed him part of his glory.
4 He sanctified him through faithfulness and meekness; he chose him out of all mankind.
5 He made him hear his voice, and led him into the thick darkness, and gave him the commandments face to face, the law of life and knowledge, to teach Jacob the covenant, and Israel his judgments.
### Aaron
6 He exalted Aaron, the brother of Moses, a holy man like him, of the tribe of Levi.
7 He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him the priesthood of the people. He blessed him with splendid vestments, and put a glorious robe upon him.
8 He clothed him with superb perfection, and strengthened him with the symbols of authority, the linen breeches, the long robe, and the ephod.
9 And he encircled him with pomegranates, with very many golden bells round about, to send forth a sound as he walked, to make their ringing heard in the temple as a reminder to the sons of his people;
10 with a holy garment, of gold and blue and purple, the work of an embroiderer; with the oracle of judgment, Urim and Thummim;
11 with twisted scarlet, the work of a craftsman; with precious stones engraved like signets, in a setting of gold, the work of a jeweler, for a reminder, in engraved letters, according to the number of the tribes of Israel;
12 with a gold crown upon his turban, inscribed like a signet with “Holiness,” a distinction to be prized, the work of an expert, the delight of the eyes, richly adorned.
13 Before his time there never were such beautiful things. No outsider ever put them on, but only his sons and his descendants perpetually.
14 His sacrifices shall be wholly burned twice every day continually.
15 Moses ordained him, and anointed him with holy oil; it was an everlasting covenant for him and for his descendants all the days of heaven, to minister to the Lordmand serve as priest and bless his people in his name.
16 He chose him out of all the living to offer sacrifice to the Lord, incense and a pleasing odor as a memorial portion, to make atonement for the people.n
17 In his commandments he gave him authority and statutes andojudgments, to teach Jacob the testimonies, and to enlighten Israel with his law.
18 Outsiders conspired against him, and envied him in the wilderness, Dathan and Abiʹram and their men and the company of Korah, in wrath and anger.
19 The Lord saw it and was not pleased, and in the wrath of his anger they were destroyed; he wrought wonders against them to consume them in flaming fire.
20 He added glory to Aaron and gave him a heritage; he allotted to him the first of the first fruits, he prepared bread of first fruits in abundance;
21 for they eat the sacrifices to the Lord, which he gave to him and his descendants.
22 But in the land of the people he has no inheritance, and he has no portion among the people; for the Lordphimself is hisqportion and inheritance.
### Phinehas
23 Phinʹehas the son of Eleaʹzar is the third in glory, for he was zealous in the fear of the Lord, and stood fast, when the people turned away, in the ready goodness of his soul, and made atonement for Israel.
24 Therefore a covenant of peace was established with him, that he should be leader of the sanctuary and of his people, that he and his descendants should have the dignity of the priesthood for ever.
25 A covenant was also established with David, the son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah: the heritage of the king is from son to son only; so the heritage of Aaron is for his descendants.
26 May the Lord grant you wisdom in your heart to judge his people in righteousness, so that their prosperity may not vanish, and that their glory may endure throughout their generations.s


# Liber Ecclesiastici 45 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dilectus Deo et hominibus Moyses,cujus memoria in benedictione est.
2 Similem illum fecit in gloria sanctorum,et magnificavit eum in timore inimicorum,et in verbis suis monstra placavit.
3 Glorificavit illum in conspectu regum,et jussit illi coram populo suo,et ostendit illi gloriam suam.
4 In fide et lenitate ipsius sanctum fecit illum,et elegit eum ex omni carne.
5 Audivit enim eum, et vocem ipsius,et induxit illum in nubem.
6 Et dedit illi coram præcepta,et legem vitæ et disciplinæ,docere Jacob testamentum suum,et judicia sua Israël.

7 Excelsum fecit Aaron fratrem ejus,et similem sibi, de tribu Levi.
8 Statuit ei testamentum æternum,et dedit illi sacerdotium gentis,et beatificavit illum in gloria:
9 et circumcinxit eum zona gloriæ,et induit eum stolam gloriæ,et coronavit eum in vasis virtutis.
10 Circumpedes, et femoralia, et humerale posuit ei:et cinxit illum tintinnabulis aureis plurimis in gyro:
11 dare sonitum in incessu suo,auditum facere sonitum in temploin memoriam filiis gentis suæ.
12 Stolam sanctam auro, et hyacintho, et purpura,opus textile viri sapientis, judicio et veritate præditi:
13 torto cocco opus artificisgemmis pretiosis figuratis in ligatura auri,et opere lapidarii sculptis,in memoriam secundum numerum tribuum Israël.
14 Corona aurea super mitram ejusexpressa signo sanctitatis, et gloria honoris:opus virtutis, et desideria oculorum ornata.
15 Sic pulchra ante ipsum non fuerunt taliausque ad originem.
16 Non est indutus illa alienigena aliquis,sed tantum filii ipsius soli,et nepotes ejus per omne tempus.

17 Sacrificia ipsiusconsumpta sunt igne quotidie.
18 Complevit Moyses manus ejus,et unxit illum oleo sancto.
19 Factum est illi in testamentum æternum,et semini ejus, sicut dies cæli,fungi sacerdotio, et habere laudem,et glorificare populum suum in nomine ejus.
20 Ipsum elegit ab omni vivente,offerre sacrificium Deo, incensum, et bonum odorem,in memoriam placare pro populo suo:
21 et dedit illi in præceptis suis potestatem,in testamentis judiciorum:docere Jacob testimonia,et in lege sua lucem dare Israël.
22 Quia contra illum steterunt alieni,et propter invidiam circumdederunt illum homines in deserto,qui erant cum Dathan et Abiron,et congregatio Core in iracundia.
23 Vidit Dominus Deus, et non placuit illi,et consumpti sunt in impetu iracundiæ.
24 Fecit illis monstra,et consumpsit illos in flamma ignis.
25 Et addidit Aaron gloriam,et dedit illi hæreditatem,et primitias frugum terræ divisit illi.
26 Panem ipsis in primis paravit in satietatem:nam et sacrificia Domini edent,quæ dedit illi et semini ejus.
27 Ceterum in terra gentes non hæreditabit,et pars non est illi in gente:ipse est enim pars ejus, et hæreditas.

28 Phinees, filius Eleazari, tertius in gloria est,imitando eum in timore Domini,
29 et stare in reverentia gentis:in bonitate et alacritate animæ suæ placuit Deo pro Israël.
30 Ideo statuit illi testamentum pacis,principem sanctorum et gentis suæ,ut sit illi et semini ejus sacerdotii dignitas in æternum.
31 Et testamentum David regi filio Jesse de tribu Juda,hæreditas ipsi et semini ejus:ut daret sapientiam in cor nostrum,judicare gentem suam in justitia,ne abolerentur bona ipsorum:et gloriam ipsorum in gentem eorum æternam fecit.
