# Book of Ecclesiasticus 47 (RSVCE)

### Nathan
1 And after him Nathan rose up to prophesy in the days of David.
### David
2 As the fat is selected from the peace offering, so David was selected from the sons of Israel.
3 He played with lions as with young goats, and with bears as with lambs of the flock.
4 In his youth did he not kill a giant, and take away reproach from the people, when he lifted his hand with a stone in the sling and struck down the boasting of Goliath?
5 For he appealed to the Lord, the Most High, and he gave him strength in his right hand to slay a man mighty in war, to exalt the powerxof his people.
6 So they glorified him for his ten thousands, and praised him for the blessings of the Lord, when the glorious diadem was bestowed upon him.
7 For he wiped out his enemies on every side, and annihilated his adversaries the Philistines; he crushed their poweryeven to this day.
8 In all that he did he gave thanks to the Holy One, the Most High, with ascriptions of glory; he sang praise with all his heart, and he loved his Maker.
9 He placed singers before the altar, to make sweet melody with their voices.
10 He gave beauty to the feasts, and arranged their times throughout the year,z while they praised God’saholy name, and the sanctuary resounded from early morning.
11 The Lord took away his sins, and exalted his powerbfor ever; he gave him the covenant of kings and a throne of glory in Israel.
### Solomon
12 After him rose up a wise son who fared amplycbecause of him;
13 Solomon reigned in days of peace, and God gave him rest on every side, that he might build a house for his name and prepare a sanctuary to stand for ever.
14 How wise you became in your youth! You overflowed like a river with understanding.
15 Your soul covered the earth, and you filled it with parables and riddles.
16 Your name reached to far-off islands, and you were loved for your peace.
17 For your songs and proverbs and parables, and for your interpretations, the countries marveled at you.
18 In the name of the Lord God, who is called the God of Israel, you gathered gold like tin and amassed silver like lead.
19 But you laid your loins beside women, and through your body you were brought into subjection.
20 You put a stain upon your honor, and defiled your posterity, so that you brought wrath upon your children and they were grieveddat your folly,
21 so that the sovereignty was divided and a disobedient kingdom arose out of Eʹphraim.
22 But the Lord will never give up his mercy, nor cause any of his works to perish; he will never blot out the descendants of his chosen one, nor destroy the posterity of him who loved him; so he gave a remnant to Jacob, and to David a root of his stock.
### Rehoboam and Jeroboam
23 Solomon rested with his fathers, and left behind him one of his sons, ample inefolly and lacking in understanding, Rehoboʹam, whose policy caused the people to revolt. Also Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin and gave to Eʹphraim a sinful way.
24 Their sins became exceedingly many, so as to remove them from their land.
25 For they sought out every sort of wickedness, till vengeance came upon them.


# Liber Ecclesiastici 47 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Post hæc surrexit Nathan,propheta in diebus David.
2 Et quasi adeps separatus a carne,sic David a filiis Israël.
3 Cum leonibus lusit quasi cum agnis,et in ursis similiter fecit sicut in agnis ovium, in juventute sua.
4 Numquid non occidit gigantem,et abstulit opprobrium de gente?
5 In tollendo manum,saxo fundæ dejecit exsultationem Goliæ:
6 nam invocavit Dominum omnipotentem,et dedit in dextera ejus tollere hominem fortem in bello,et exaltare cornu gentis suæ.
7 Sic in decem millibus glorificavit eum:et laudavit eum in benedictionibus Domini,in offerendo illi coronam gloriæ:
8 contrivit enim inimicos undique,et extirpavit Philisthiim contrarios usque in hodiernum diem:contrivit cornu ipsorum usque in æternum.
9 In omni opere dedit confessionem Sancto,et Excelso in verbo gloriæ.
10 De omni corde suo laudavit Dominum:et dilexit Deum, qui fecit illum,et dedit illi contra inimicos potentiam:
11 et stare fecit cantores contra altare,et in sono eorum dulces fecit modos.
12 Et dedit in celebrationibus decus,et ornavit tempora usque ad consummationem vitæ,ut laudarent nomen sanctum Domini,et amplificarent mane Dei sanctitatem.
13 Dominus purgavit peccata ipsius,et exaltavit in æternum cornu ejus:et dedit illi testamentum regni,et sedem gloriæ in Israël.

14 Post ipsum surrexit filius sensatus,et propter illum dejecit omnem potentiam inimicorum.
15 Salomon imperavit in diebus pacis,cui subjecit Deus omnes hostes,ut conderet domum in nomine suo,et pararet sanctitatem in sempiternum.Quemadmodum eruditus es in juventute tua,
16 et impletus es, quasi flumen, sapientia,et terram retexit anima tua.
17 Et replesti in comparationibus ænigmata:ad insulas longe divulgatum est nomen tuum,et dilectus es in pace tua.
18 In cantilenis, et proverbiis,et comparationibus, et interpretationibus, miratæ sunt terræ:
19 et in nomine Domini Dei,cui est cognomen Deus Israël.
20 Collegisti quasi auricalcum aurum,et ut plumbum complesti argentum:
21 et inclinasti femora tua mulieribus:potestatem habuisti in corpore tuo.
22 Dedisti maculam in gloria tua,et profanasti semen tuum,inducere iracundiam ad liberos tuos,et incitari stultitiam tuam:
23 ut faceres imperium bipartitum,et ex Ephraim imperare imperium durum.

24 Deus autem non derelinquet misericordiam suam:et non corrumpet, nec delebit opera sua,neque perdet a stirpe nepotes electi sui,et semen ejus qui diligit Dominum non corrumpet.
25 Dedit autem reliquum Jacob,et David de ipsa stirpe.
26 Et finem habuit Salomon cum patribus suis.
27 Et dereliquit post se de semine suo, gentis stultitiam,
28 et imminutum a prudentia, Roboam,qui avertit gentem consilio suo:
29 et Jeroboam filium Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël,et dedit viam peccandi Ephraim:et plurima redundaverunt peccata ipsorum.
30 Valde averterunt illos a terra sua.

31 Et quæsivit omnes nequitias,usque dum perveniret ad illos defensio,et ab omnibus peccatis liberavit eos.


# Σοφία Σειράχ 47 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ μετὰ τοῦτον ἀνέστη Ναθαν προφητεύειν ἐν ἡμέραις Δαυιδ
2 ὥσπερ στέαρ ἀφωρισμένον ἀπὸ σωτηρίου οὕτως Δαυιδ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ
3 ἐν λέουσιν ἔπαιξεν ὡς ἐν ἐρίφοις καὶ ἐν ἄρκοις ὡς ἐν ἄρνασι προβάτων ἐν νεότητι αὐτοῦ
4 οὐχὶ ἀπέκτεινεν γίγαντα καὶ ἐξῆρεν ὀνειδισμὸν ἐκ λαοῦ
5 ἐν τῷ ἐπᾶραι χεῖρα ἐν λίθῳ σφενδόνης καὶ καταβαλεῖν γαυρίαμα τοῦ Γολιαθ
6 ἐπεκαλέσατο γὰρ κύριον τὸν ὕψιστον καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ κράτος ἐξᾶραι ἄνθρωπον δυνατὸν ἐν πολέμῳ ἀνυψῶσαι κέρας λαοῦ αὐτοῦ
7 οὕτως ἐν μυριάσιν ἐδόξασαν αὐτὸν καὶ ᾔνεσαν αὐτὸν ἐν εὐλογίαις κυρίου ἐν τῷ φέρεσθαι αὐτῷ διάδημα δόξης
8 ἐξέτριψεν γὰρ ἐχθροὺς κυκλόθεν καὶ ἐξουδένωσεν Φυλιστιιμ τοὺς ὑπεναντίους ἕως σήμερον συνέτριψεν αὐτῶν κέρας
9 ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ αὐτοῦ ἔδωκεν ἐξομολόγησιν ἁγίῳ ὑψίστῳ ῥήματι δόξης
10 ἐν πάσῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ ὕμνησεν καὶ ἠγάπησεν τὸν ποιήσαντα αὐτόν
11 καὶ ἔστησεν ψαλτῳδοὺς κατέναντι τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ ἐξ ἠχοῦς αὐτῶν γλυκαίνειν μέλη
12 ἔδωκεν ἐν ἑορταῖς εὐπρέπειαν καὶ ἐκόσμησεν καιροὺς μέχρι συντελείας ἐν τῷ αἰνεῖν αὐτοὺς τὸ ἅγιον ὄνομα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ πρωίας ἠχεῖν τὸ ἁγίασμα
13 κύριος ἀφεῖλεν τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνύψωσεν εἰς αἰῶνα τὸ κέρας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ διαθήκην βασιλέων καὶ θρόνον δόξης ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ

14 μετὰ τοῦτον ἀνέστη υἱὸς ἐπιστήμων καὶ δ{I'} αὐτὸν κατέλυσεν ἐν πλατυσμῷ
15 Σαλωμων ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν ἡμέραις εἰρήνης ᾧ ὁ θεὸς κατέπαυσεν κυκλόθεν ἵνα στήσῃ οἶκον ἐ{P'} ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ καὶ ἑτοιμάσῃ ἁγίασμα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
16 ὡς ἐσοφίσθης ἐν νεότητί σου καὶ ἐνεπλήσθης ὡς ποταμὸς συνέσεως γῆν ἐπεκάλυψεν ἡ ψυχή σου
17 καὶ ἐνέπλησας ἐν παραβολαῖς αἰνιγμάτων εἰς νήσους πόρρω ἀφίκετο τὸ ὄνομά σου καὶ ἠγαπήθης ἐν τῇ εἰρήνῃ σου
18 ἐν ᾠδαῖς καὶ παροιμίαις καὶ παραβολαῖς καὶ ἐν ἑρμηνείαις ἀπεθαύμασάν σε χῶραι
19 ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἐπικεκλημένου θεοῦ Ισραηλ
20 συνήγαγες ὡς κασσίτερον τὸ χρυσίον καὶ ὡς μόλιβον ἐπλήθυνας ἀργύριον
21 παρανέκλινας τὰς λαγόνας σου γυναιξὶν καὶ ἐνεξουσιάσθης ἐν τῷ σώματί σου
22 ἔδωκας μῶμον ἐν τῇ δόξῃ σου καὶ ἐβεβήλωσας τὸ σπέρμα σου ἐπαγαγεῖν ὀργὴν ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα σου καὶ κατανυγῆναι ἐπὶ τῇ ἀφροσύνῃ σου
23 γενέσθαι δίχα τυραννίδα καὶ ἐξ Εφραιμ ἄρξαι βασιλείαν ἀπειθῆ

24 ὁ δὲ κύριος οὐ μὴ καταλίπῃ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐ μὴ διαφθείρῃ ἀπὸ τῶν λόγων αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ μὴ ἐξαλείψῃ ἐκλεκτοῦ αὐτοῦ ἔκγονα καὶ σπέρμα τοῦ ἀγαπήσαντος αὐτὸν οὐ μὴ ἐξάρῃ
25 καὶ τῷ Ιακωβ ἔδωκεν κατάλειμμα καὶ τῷ Δαυιδ ἐξ αὐτοῦ ῥίζαν
26 καὶ ἀνεπαύσατο Σαλωμων μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ
27 καὶ κατέλιπεν με{T'} αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ λαοῦ ἀφροσύνην
28 καὶ ἐλασσούμενον συνέσει Ροβοαμ ὃς ἀπέστησεν λαὸν ἐκ βουλῆς αὐτοῦ
29 καὶ Ιεροβοαμ υἱὸς Ναβατ ὃς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ καὶ ἔδωκεν τῷ Εφραιμ ὁδὸν ἁμαρτίας καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτῶν
30 σφόδρα ἀποστῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν

31 καὶ πᾶσαν πονηρίαν ἐξεζήτησαν ἕως ἐκδίκησις ἔλθῃ ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
