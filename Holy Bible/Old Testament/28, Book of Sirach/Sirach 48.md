# Book of Ecclesiasticus 48 (RSVCE)

### Elijah
1 Then the prophet Eliʹjah arose like a fire, and his word burned like a torch.
2 He brought a famine upon them, and by his zeal he made them few in number.
3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heavens, and also three times brought down fire.
4 How glorious you were, O Eliʹjah, in your wondrous deeds! And who has the right to boast which you have?
5 You who raised a corpse from death and from Hades, by the word of the Most High;
6 who brought kings down to destruction, and famous men from their beds;
7 who heard rebuke at Sinai and judgments of vengeance at Horeb;
8 who anointed kings to inflict retribution, and prophets to succeed you.f
9 You who were taken up by a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot with horses of fire;
10 you who are ready at the appointed time, it is written, to calm the wrath of God before it breaks out in fury, to turn the heart of the father to the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.
11 Blessed are those who saw you, and those who have been adornedhin love; for we also shall surely live.i
### Elisha
12 It was Eliʹjah who was covered by the whirlwind, and Eliʹsha was filled with his spirit; in all his days he did not tremble before any ruler, and no one brought him into subjection.
13 Nothing was too hard for him, and when he was dead his body prophesied.
14 As in his life he did wonders, so in death his deeds were marvelous.
15 For all this the people did not repent, and they did not forsake their sins, till they were carried away captive from their land and were scattered over all the earth; the people were left very few in number, but with rulers from the house of David.
16 Some of them did what was pleasing to God, but others multiplied sins.
### Hezekiah
17 Hezekiʹah fortified his city, and brought water into the midst of it; he tunneled the sheer rock with iron and built pools for water.
18 In his days Sennachʹerib came up, and sent the Rabʹshakeh;k he lifted up his hand against Zion and made great boasts in his arrogance.
19 Then their hearts were shaken and their hands trembled, and they were in anguish, like women in travail.
20 But they called upon the Lord who is merciful, spreading forth their hands toward him; and the Holy One quickly heard them from heaven, and delivered them by the hand of Isaiah.
21 The Lord smote the camp of the Assyrians, and his angel wiped them out.
22 For Hezekiʹah did what was pleasing to the Lord, and he held strongly to the ways of David his father, which Isaiah the prophet commanded, who was great and faithful in his vision.
### Isaiah
23 In his days the sun went backward, and he lengthened the life of the king.
24 By the spirit of might he saw the last things, and comforted those who mourned in Zion.
25 He revealed what was to occur to the end of time, and the hidden things before they came to pass.


# Liber Ecclesiastici 48 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et surrexit Elias propheta quasi ignis,et verbum ipsius quasi facula ardebat.
2 Qui induxit in illos famem:et irritantes illum invidia sua pauci facti sunt:non enim poterant sustinere præcepta Domini.
3 Verbo Domini continuit cælum,et dejecit de cælo ignem ter.
4 Sic amplificatus est Elias in mirabilibus suis.Et quis potest similiter sic gloriari tibi?
5 qui sustulisti mortuum ab inferis de sorte mortis,in verbo Domini Dei:
6 qui dejecisti reges ad pernicem,et confregisti facile potentiam ipsorum,et gloriosos de lecto suo:
7 qui audis in Sina judicium,et in Horeb judicia defensionis:
8 qui ungis reges ad pœnitentiam,et prophetas facis successores post te:
9 qui receptus es in turbine ignis,in curru equorum igneorum:
10 qui scriptus es in judiciis temporum,lenire iracundiam Domini,conciliare cor patris ad filium,et restituere tribus Jacob.
11 Beati sunt qui te viderunt,et in amicitia tua decorati sunt.
12 Nam nos vita vivimus tantum:post mortem autem non erit tale nomen nostrum.

13 Elias quidem in turbine tectus est,et in Eliseo completus est spiritus ejus:in diebus suis non pertimuit principem,et potentia nemo vicit illum:
14 nec superavit illum verbum aliquod,et mortuum prophetavit corpus ejus.
15 In vita sua fecit monstra,et in morte mirabilia operatus est.
16 In omnibus istis non pœnituit populus,et non recesserunt a peccatis suis,usque dum ejecti sunt de terra sua,et dispersi sunt in omnem terram:
17 et relicta est gens perpauca,et princeps in domo David.
18 Quidam ipsorum fecerunt quod placeret Deo:alii autem multa commiserunt peccata.

19 Ezechias munivit civitatem suam,et induxit in medium ipsius aquam:et fodit ferro rupem,et ædificavit ad aquam puteum.
20 In diebus ipsius ascendit Sennacherib,et misit Rabsacen, et sustulit manum suam contra illos:et extulit manum suam in Sion,et superbus factus est potentia sua.
21 Tunc mota sunt corda et manus ipsorum:et doluerunt quasi parturientes mulieres.
22 Et invocaverunt Dominum misericordem,et expandentes manus suas extulerunt ad cælum:et Sanctus, Dominus Deus, audivit cito vocem ipsorum.
23 Non est commemoratus peccatorum illorum,neque dedit illos inimicis suis:sed purgavit eos in manu Isaiæ sancti prophetæ.
24 Dejecit castra Assyriorum,et contrivit illos angelus Domini:
25 nam fecit Ezechias quod placuit Deo,et fortiter ivit in via David patris sui,quam mandavit illi Isaias, propheta magnus,et fidelis in conspectu Dei.
26 In diebus ipsius retro rediit sol,et addidit regi vitam.
27 Spiritu magno vidit ultima,et consolatus est lugentes in Sionusque in sempiternum.
28 Ostendit futura,et abscondita antequam evenirent.


# Σοφία Σειράχ 48 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἀνέστη Ηλιας προφήτης ὡς πῦρ καὶ ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ ὡς λαμπὰς ἐκαίετο
2 ὃς ἐπήγαγεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς λιμὸν καὶ τῷ ζήλῳ αὐτοῦ ὠλιγοποίησεν αὐτούς
3 ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου ἀνέσχεν οὐρανόν κατήγαγεν οὕτως τρὶς πῦρ
4 ὡς ἐδοξάσθης Ηλια ἐν θαυμασίοις σου καὶ τίς ὅμοιός σοι καυχᾶσθαι
5 ὁ ἐγείρας νεκρὸν ἐκ θανάτου καὶ ἐξ ᾅδου ἐν λόγῳ ὑψίστου
6 ὁ καταγαγὼν βασιλεῖς εἰς ἀπώλειαν καὶ δεδοξασμένους ἀπὸ κλίνης αὐτῶν
7 ἀκούων ἐν Σινα ἐλεγμὸν καὶ ἐν Χωρηβ κρίματα ἐκδικήσεως
8 ὁ χρίων βασιλεῖς εἰς ἀνταπόδομα καὶ προφήτας διαδόχους με{T'} αὐτόν
9 ὁ ἀναλημφθεὶς ἐν λαίλαπι πυρὸς ἐν ἅρματι ἵππων πυρίνων
10 ὁ καταγραφεὶς ἐν ἐλεγμοῖς εἰς καιροὺς κοπάσαι ὀργὴν πρὸ θυμοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι καρδίαν πατρὸς πρὸς υἱὸν καὶ καταστῆσαι φυλὰς Ιακωβ
11 μακάριοι οἱ ἰδόντες σε καὶ οἱ ἐν ἀγαπήσει κεκοιμημένοι
12 καὶ γὰρ ἡμεῖς ζωῇ ζησόμεθα

13 Ηλιας ὃς ἐν λαίλαπι ἐσκεπάσθη καὶ Ελισαιε ἐνεπλήσθη πνεύματος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐσαλεύθη ὑπὸ ἄρχοντος καὶ οὐ κατεδυνάστευσεν αὐτὸν οὐδείς
14 πᾶς λόγος οὐχ ὑπερῆρεν αὐτόν καὶ ἐν κοιμήσει ἐπροφήτευσεν τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ ἐν ζωῇ αὐτοῦ ἐποίησεν τέρατα καὶ ἐν τελευτῇ θαυμάσια τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ
16 ἐν πᾶσιν τούτοις οὐ μετενόησεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ οὐκ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν ἕως ἐπρονομεύθησαν ἀπὸ γῆς αὐτῶν καὶ διεσκορπίσθησαν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ
17 καὶ κατελείφθη ὁ λαὸς ὀλιγοστός καὶ ἄρχων ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Δαυιδ
18 τινὲς μὲν αὐτῶν ἐποίησαν τὸ ἀρεστόν τινὲς δὲ ἐπλήθυναν ἁμαρτίας

19 Εζεκιας ὠχύρωσεν τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσήγαγεν εἰς μέσον αὐτῆς ὕδωρ ὤρυξεν σιδήρῳ ἀκρότομον καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν κρήνας εἰς ὕδατα
20 ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἀνέβη Σενναχηριμ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ραψακην καὶ ἀπῆρεν καὶ ἐπῆρεν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Σιων καὶ ἐμεγαλαύχησεν ἐν ὑπερηφανίᾳ αὐτοῦ
21 τότε ἐσαλεύθησαν καρδίαι καὶ χεῖρες αὐτῶν καὶ ὠδίνησαν ὡς αἱ τίκτουσαι
22 καὶ ἐπεκαλέσαντο τὸν κύριον τὸν ἐλεήμονα ἐκπετάσαντες τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ ὁ ἅγιος ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ταχὺ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτῶν
23 καὶ ἐλυτρώσατο αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ Ησαιου
24 ἐπάταξεν τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν Ἀσσυρίων καὶ ἐξέτριψεν αὐτοὺς ὁ ἄγγελος αὐτοῦ
25 ἐποίησεν γὰρ Εζεκιας τὸ ἀρεστὸν κυρίῳ καὶ ἐνίσχυσεν ἐν ὁδοῖς Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἃς ἐνετείλατο Ησαιας ὁ προφήτης ὁ μέγας καὶ πιστὸς ἐν ὁράσει αὐτοῦ
26 ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἀνεπόδισεν ὁ ἥλιος καὶ προσέθηκεν ζωὴν βασιλεῖ
27 πνεύματι μεγάλῳ εἶδεν τὰ ἔσχατα καὶ παρεκάλεσεν τοὺς πενθοῦντας ἐν Σιων ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος
28 ὑπέδειξεν τὰ ἐσόμενα καὶ τὰ ἀπόκρυφα πρὶν ἢ παραγενέσθαι αὐτά
