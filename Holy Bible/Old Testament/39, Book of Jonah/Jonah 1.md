# Book of Jonah 1 (RSVCE)

### Jonah Tries to Run Away from God
1 Now the word of theLordcame to Jonah the son of Amitʹtai, saying,
2 “Arise, go to Ninʹeveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness has come up before me.”
3 But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of theLord. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare, and went on board, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of theLord.
4 But theLordhurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up.
5 Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried to his god; and they threw the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down, and was fast asleep.
6 So the captain came and said to him, “What do you mean, you sleeper? Arise, call upon your god! Perhaps the god will give a thought to us, that we do not perish.”
7 And they said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
8 Then they said to him, “Tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us. What is your occupation? And whence do you come? What is your country? And of what people are you?”
9 And he said to them, “I am a Hebrew; and I fear theLord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”
10 Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, “What is this that you have done!” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of theLord, because he had told them.
11 Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?” For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
12 He said to them, “Take me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you; for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you.”
13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring the ship back to land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.
14 Therefore they cried to theLord, “We beseech thee, OLord, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not on us innocent blood; for thou, OLord, hast done as it pleased thee.”
15 So they took up Jonah and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.
16 Then the men feared theLordexceedingly, and they offered a sacrifice to theLordand made vows.
17 And theLordappointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.


# Prophetia Jonae 1 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et factum est verbum Domini ad Jonam, filium Amathi, dicens:
2 Surge, et vade in Niniven, civitatem grandem, et prædica in ea, quia ascendit malitia ejus coram me.
3 Et surrexit Jonas, ut fugeret in Tharsis a facie Domini, et descendit in Joppen: et invenit navem euntem in Tharsis, et dedit naulum ejus, et descendit in eam ut iret cum eis in Tharsis a facie Domini.

4 Dominus autem misit ventum magnum in mare: et facta est tempestas magna in mari, et navis periclitabatur conteri.
5 Et timuerunt nautæ, et clamaverunt viri ad deum suum, et miserunt vasa quæ erant in navi, in mare, ut alleviaretur ab eis; et Jonas descendit ad interiora navis, et dormiebat sopore gravi.
6 Et accessit ad eum gubernator, et dixit ei: Quid tu sopore deprimeris? surge, invoca Deum tuum, si forte recogitet Deus de nobis, et non pereamus.

7 Et dixit vir ad collegam suum: Venite et mittamus sortes, et sciamus quare hoc malum sit nobis. Et miserunt sortes, et cecidit sors super Jonam.
8 Et dixerunt ad eum: Indica nobis cujus causa malum istud sit nobis: quod est opus tuum? quæ terra tua, et quo vadis? vel ex quo populo es tu?
9 Et dixit ad eos: Hebræus ego sum, et Dominum Deum cæli ego timeo, qui fecit mare et aridam.
10 Et timuerunt viri timore magno, et dixerunt ad eum: Quid hoc fecisti? cognoverunt enim viri quod a facie Domini fugeret, quia indicaverat eis.
11 Et dixerunt ad eum: Quid faciemus tibi, et cessabit mare a nobis? quia mare ibat, et intumescebat.
12 Et dixit ad eos: Tollite me, et mittite in mare, et cessabit mare a vobis: scio enim ego quoniam propter me tempestas hæc grandis venit super vos.

13 Et remigabant viri ut reverterentur ad aridam, et non valebant, quia mare ibat, et intumescebat super eos.
14 Et clamaverunt ad Dominum, et dixerunt: Quæsumus, Domine, ne pereamus in anima viri istius, et ne des super nos sanguinem innocentem: quia tu, Domine, sicut voluisti, fecisti.
15 Et tulerunt Jonam, et miserunt in mare: et stetit mare a fervore suo.
16 Et timuerunt viri timore magno Dominum: et immolaverunt hostias Domino, et voverunt vota.


# Ἰωνᾶς 1 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος κυρίου πρὸς Ιωναν τὸν τοῦ Αμαθι λέγων
2 ἀνάστηθι καὶ πορεύθητι εἰς Νινευη τὴν πόλιν τὴν μεγάλην καὶ κήρυξον ἐν αὐτῇ ὅτι ἀνέβη ἡ κραυγὴ τῆς κακίας αὐτῆς πρός με
3 καὶ ἀνέστη Ιωνας τοῦ φυγεῖν εἰς Θαρσις ἐκ προσώπου κυρίου καὶ κατέβη εἰς Ιοππην καὶ εὗρεν πλοῖον βαδίζον εἰς Θαρσις καὶ ἔδωκεν τὸ ναῦλον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐνέβη εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦ πλεῦσαι με{T'} αὐτῶν εἰς Θαρσις ἐκ προσώπου κυρίου

4 καὶ κύριος ἐξήγειρεν πνεῦμα εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ ἐγένετο κλύδων μέγας ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ καὶ τὸ πλοῖον ἐκινδύνευεν συντριβῆναι
5 καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ ναυτικοὶ καὶ ἀνεβόων ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν θεὸν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐκβολὴν ἐποιήσαντο τῶν σκευῶν τῶν ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τοῦ κουφισθῆναι ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν Ιωνας δὲ κατέβη εἰς τὴν κοίλην τοῦ πλοίου καὶ ἐκάθευδεν καὶ ἔρρεγχεν
6 καὶ προσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ πρωρεὺς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τί σὺ ῥέγχεις ἀνάστα καὶ ἐπικαλοῦ τὸν θεόν σου ὅπως διασώσῃ ὁ θεὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ μὴ ἀπολώμεθα

7 καὶ εἶπεν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ δεῦτε βάλωμεν κλήρους καὶ ἐπιγνῶμεν τίνος ἕνεκεν ἡ κακία αὕτη ἐστὶν ἐν ἡμῖν καὶ ἔβαλον κλήρους καὶ ἔπεσεν ὁ κλῆρος ἐπὶ Ιωναν
8 καὶ εἶπον πρὸς αὐτόν ἀπάγγειλον ἡμῖν τίνος ἕνεκεν ἡ κακία αὕτη ἐστὶν ἐν ἡμῖν τίς σου ἡ ἐργασία ἐστίν καὶ πόθεν ἔρχῃ καὶ ἐκ ποίας χώρας καὶ ἐκ ποίου λαοῦ εἶ σύ
9 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς δοῦλος κυρίου ἐγώ εἰμι καὶ τὸν κύριον θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐγὼ σέβομαι ὃς ἐποίησεν τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ τὴν ξηράν
10 καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ ἄνδρες φόβον μέγαν καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν τί τοῦτο ἐποίησας διότι ἔγνωσαν οἱ ἄνδρες ὅτι ἐκ προσώπου κυρίου ἦν φεύγων ὅτι ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς
11 καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν τί σοι ποιήσωμεν καὶ κοπάσει ἡ θάλασσα ἀ{F'} ἡμῶν ὅτι ἡ θάλασσα ἐπορεύετο καὶ ἐξήγειρεν μᾶλλον κλύδωνα
12 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωνας πρὸς αὐτούς ἄρατέ με καὶ ἐμβάλετέ με εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ κοπάσει ἡ θάλασσα ἀ{F'} ὑμῶν διότι ἔγνωκα ἐγὼ ὅτι δ{I'} ἐμὲ ὁ κλύδων ὁ μέγας οὗτος ἐ{F'} ὑμᾶς ἐστιν

13 καὶ παρεβιάζοντο οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς τὴν γῆν καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο ὅτι ἡ θάλασσα ἐπορεύετο καὶ ἐξηγείρετο μᾶλλον ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
14 καὶ ἀνεβόησαν πρὸς κύριον καὶ εἶπαν μηδαμῶς κύριε μὴ ἀπολώμεθα ἕνεκεν τῆς ψυχῆς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τούτου καὶ μὴ δῷς ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς αἷμα δίκαιον ὅτι σύ κύριε ὃν τρόπον ἐβούλου πεποίηκας
15 καὶ ἔλαβον τὸν Ιωναν καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ ἔστη ἡ θάλασσα ἐκ τοῦ σάλου αὐτῆς
16 καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ ἄνδρες φόβῳ μεγάλῳ τὸν κύριον καὶ ἔθυσαν θυσίαν τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ εὔξαντο εὐχάς
