# Book of Ruth 1 (RSVCE)

### Elimelech’s Family Goes to Moab
1 In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land, and a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.
2 The name of the man was Elimʹelech and the name of his wife Naʹomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilʹion; they were Ephʹrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there.
3 But Elimʹelech, the husband of Naʹomi, died, and she was left with her two sons.
4 These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years;
5 and both Mahlon and Chilʹion died, so that the woman was bereft of her two sons and her husband.
### Naʹomi and Her Moabite Daughters-in-Law
6 Then she started with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that theLordhad visited his people and given them food.
7 So she set out from the place where she was, with her two daughters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
8 But Naʹomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to her mother’s house. May theLorddeal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
9 TheLordgrant that you may find a home, each of you in the house of her husband!” Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.
10 And they said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.”
11 But Naʹomi said, “Turn back, my daughters, why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands?
12 Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons,
13 would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of theLordhas gone forth against me.”
14 Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
15 And she said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.”
16 But Ruth said, “Entreat me not to leave you or to return from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God;
17 where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May theLorddo so to me and more also if even death parts me from you.”
18 And when Naʹomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.
19 So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them; and the women said, “Is this Naʹomi?”
20 She said to them, “Do not call me Naʹomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
21 I went away full, and theLordhas brought me back empty. Why call me Naʹomi, when theLordhas afflicted me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?”
22 So Naʹomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.


# Liber Ruth 1 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In diebus unius judicis, quando judices præerant, facta est fames in terra. Abiitque homo de Bethlehem Juda, ut peregrinaretur in regione Moabitide cum uxore sua ac duobus liberis.
2 Ipse vocabatur Elimelech, et uxor ejus Noëmi: et duo filii, alter Mahalon, et alter Chelion, Ephrathæi de Bethlehem Juda. Ingressique regionem Moabitidem, morabantur ibi.
3 Et mortuus est Elimelech maritus Noëmi: remansitque ipsa cum filiis.
4 Qui acceperunt uxores Moabitidas, quarum una vocabatur Orpha, altera vero Ruth. Manseruntque ibi decem annis,
5 et ambo mortui sunt, Mahalon videlicet et Chelion: remansitque mulier orbata duobus liberis ac marito.
6 Et surrexit ut in patriam pergeret cum utraque nuru sua de regione Moabitide: audierat enim quod respexisset Dominus populum suum, et dedisset eis escas.

7 Egressa est itaque de loco peregrinationis suæ, cum utraque nuru: et jam in via revertendi posita in terram Juda,
8 dixit ad eas: Ite in domum matris vestræ: faciat vobiscum Dominus misericordiam, sicut fecistis cum mortuis, et mecum.
9 Det vobis invenire requiem in domibus virorum quos sortituræ estis. Et osculata est eas. Quæ elevata voce flere cœperunt,
10 et dicere: Tecum pergemus ad populum tuum.
11 Quibus illa respondit: Revertimini, filiæ meæ, cur venitis mecum? num ultra habeo filios in utero meo, ut viros ex me sperare possitis?
12 Revertimini, filiæ meæ, et abite: jam enim senectute confecta sum, nec apta vinculo conjugali: etiamsi possem hac nocte concipere, et parere filios,
13 si eos expectare velitis donec crescant, et annos pubertatis impleant, ante eritis vetulæ quam nubatis. Nolite, quæso, filiæ meæ: quia vestra angustia magis me premit, et egressa est manus Domini contra me.
14 Elevata igitur voce, rursum flere cœperunt: Orpha osculata est socrum, ac reversa est; Ruth adhæsit socrui suæ:

15 cui dixit Noëmi: En reversa est cognata tua ad populum suum, et ad deos suos, vade cum ea.
16 Quæ respondit: Ne adverseris mihi ut relinquam te et abeam: quocumque enim perrexeris, pergam, et ubi morata fueris, et ego pariter morabor. Populus tuus populus meus, et Deus tuus Deus meus.
17 Quæ te terra morientem susceperit, in ea moriar: ibique locum accipiam sepulturæ. Hæc mihi faciat Dominus, et hæc addat, si non sola mors me et te separaverit.

18 Videns ergo Noëmi quod obstinato animo Ruth decrevisset secum pergere, adversari noluit, nec ad suos ultra reditum persuadere:
19 profectæque sunt simul, et venerunt in Bethlehem. Quibus urbem ingressis, velox apud cunctos fama percrebruit: dicebantque mulieres: Hæc est illa Noëmi.
20 Quibus ait: Ne vocetis me Noëmi (id est, pulchram), sed vocate me Mara (id est, amaram), quia amaritudine valde replevit me Omnipotens.
21 Egressa sum plena, et vacuam reduxit me Dominus. Cur ergo vocatis me Noëmi, quam Dominus humiliavit, et afflixit Omnipotens?

22 Venit ergo Noëmi cum Ruth Moabitide nuru sua, de terra peregrinationis suæ: ac reversa est in Bethlehem, quando primum hordea metebantur.

1 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ κρίνειν τοὺς κριτὰς καὶ ἐγένετο λιμὸς ἐν τῇ γῇ καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ Βαιθλεεμ τῆς Ιουδα τοῦ παροικῆσαι ἐν ἀγρῷ Μωαβ αὐτὸς καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ἀνδρὶ Αβιμελεχ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ Νωεμιν καὶ ὄνομα τοῖς δυσὶν υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ Μααλων καὶ Χελαιων Εφραθαῖοι ἐκ Βαιθλεεμ τῆς Ιουδα καὶ ἤλθοσαν εἰς ἀγρὸν Μωαβ καὶ ἦσαν ἐκεῖ
3 καὶ ἀπέθανεν Αβιμελεχ ὁ ἀνὴρ τῆς Νωεμιν καὶ κατελείφθη αὐτὴ καὶ οἱ δύο υἱοὶ αὐτῆς
4 καὶ ἐλάβοσαν ἑαυτοῖς γυναῖκας Μωαβίτιδας ὄνομα τῇ μιᾷ Ορφα καὶ ὄνομα τῇ δευτέρᾳ Ρουθ καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐκεῖ ὡς δέκα ἔτη
5 καὶ ἀπέθανον καί γε ἀμφότεροι Μααλων καὶ Χελαιων καὶ κατελείφθη ἡ γυνὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν δύο υἱῶν αὐτῆς
6 καὶ ἀνέστη αὐτὴ καὶ αἱ δύο νύμφαι αὐτῆς καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν ἐξ ἀγροῦ Μωαβ ὅτι ἤκουσαν ἐν ἀγρῷ Μωαβ ὅτι ἐπέσκεπται κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ δοῦναι αὐτοῖς ἄρτους

7 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τοῦ τόπου οὗ ἦν ἐκεῖ καὶ αἱ δύο νύμφαι αὐτῆς με{T'} αὐτῆς καὶ ἐπορεύοντο ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι εἰς τὴν γῆν Ιουδα
8 καὶ εἶπεν Νωεμιν ταῖς νύμφαις αὐτῆς πορεύεσθε δὴ ἀποστράφητε ἑκάστη εἰς οἶκον μητρὸς αὐτῆς ποιήσαι κύριος με{Q'} ὑμῶν ἔλεος καθὼς ἐποιήσατε μετὰ τῶν τεθνηκότων καὶ με{T'} ἐμοῦ
9 δῴη κύριος ὑμῖν καὶ εὕροιτε ἀνάπαυσιν ἑκάστη ἐν οἴκῳ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτάς καὶ ἐπῆραν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκλαυσαν
10 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ μετὰ σοῦ ἐπιστρέφομεν εἰς τὸν λαόν σου
11 καὶ εἶπεν Νωεμιν ἐπιστράφητε δή θυγατέρες μου καὶ ἵνα τί πορεύεσθε με{T'} ἐμοῦ μὴ ἔτι μοι υἱοὶ ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ μου καὶ ἔσονται ὑμῖν εἰς ἄνδρας
12 ἐπιστράφητε δή θυγατέρες μου διότι γεγήρακα τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ἀνδρί ὅτι εἶπα ὅτι ἔστιν μοι ὑπόστασις τοῦ γενηθῆναί με ἀνδρὶ καὶ τέξομαι υἱούς
13 μὴ αὐτοὺς προσδέξεσθε ἕως οὗ ἁδρυνθῶσιν ἢ αὐτοῖς κατασχεθήσεσθε τοῦ μὴ γενέσθαι ἀνδρί μὴ δή θυγατέρες μου ὅτι ἐπικράνθη μοι ὑπὲρ ὑμᾶς ὅτι ἐξῆλθεν ἐν ἐμοὶ χεὶρ κυρίου
14 καὶ ἐπῆραν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκλαυσαν ἔτι καὶ κατεφίλησεν Ορφα τὴν πενθερὰν αὐτῆς καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὸν λαὸν αὐτῆς Ρουθ δὲ ἠκολούθησεν αὐτῇ

15 καὶ εἶπεν Νωεμιν πρὸς Ρουθ ἰδοὺ ἀνέστρεψεν ἡ σύννυμφός σου πρὸς λαὸν αὐτῆς καὶ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῆς ἐπιστράφητι δὴ καὶ σὺ ὀπίσω τῆς συννύμφου σου
16 εἶπεν δὲ Ρουθ μὴ ἀπαντήσαι ἐμοὶ τοῦ καταλιπεῖν σε ἢ ἀποστρέψαι ὄπισθέν σου ὅτι σὺ ὅπου ἐὰν πορευθῇς πορεύσομαι καὶ οὗ ἐὰν αὐλισθῇς αὐλισθήσομαι ὁ λαός σου λαός μου καὶ ὁ θεός σου θεός μου
17 καὶ οὗ ἐὰν ἀποθάνῃς ἀποθανοῦμαι κἀκεῖ ταφήσομαι τάδε ποιήσαι μοι κύριος καὶ τάδε προσθείη ὅτι θάνατος διαστελεῖ ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ

18 ἰδοῦσα δὲ Νωεμιν ὅτι κραταιοῦται αὐτὴ τοῦ πορεύεσθαι με{T'} αὐτῆς ἐκόπασεν τοῦ λαλῆσαι πρὸς αὐτὴν ἔτι
19 ἐπορεύθησαν δὲ ἀμφότεραι ἕως τοῦ παραγενέσθαι αὐτὰς εἰς Βαιθλεεμ καὶ ἤχησεν πᾶσα ἡ πόλις ἐ{P'} αὐταῖς καὶ εἶπον αὕτη ἐστὶν Νωεμιν
20 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτάς μὴ δὴ καλεῖτέ με Νωεμιν καλέσατέ με Πικράν ὅτι ἐπικράνθη ἐν ἐμοὶ ὁ ἱκανὸς σφόδρα
21 ἐγὼ πλήρης ἐπορεύθην καὶ κενὴν ἀπέστρεψέν με ὁ κύριος καὶ ἵνα τί καλεῖτέ με Νωεμιν καὶ κύριος ἐταπείνωσέν με καὶ ὁ ἱκανὸς ἐκάκωσέν με

22 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Νωεμιν καὶ Ρουθ ἡ Μωαβῖτις ἡ νύμφη αὐτῆς ἐπιστρέφουσα ἐξ ἀγροῦ Μωαβ αὐταὶ δὲ παρεγενήθησαν εἰς Βαιθλεεμ ἐν ἀρχῇ θερισμοῦ κριθῶν
