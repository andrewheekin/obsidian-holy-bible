# Book of Ruth 2 (RSVCE)

### Ruth Meets Boaz
1 Now Naʹomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a man of wealth, of the family of Elimʹelech, whose name was Boʹaz.
2 And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naʹomi, “Let me go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.”
3 So she set forth and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boʹaz, who was of the family of Elimʹelech.
4 And behold, Boʹaz came from Bethlehem; and he said to the reapers, “TheLordbe with you!” And they answered, “TheLordbless you.”
5 Then Boʹaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose maiden is this?”
6 And the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite maiden, who came back with Naʹomi from the country of Moab.
7 She said, ‘Pray, let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers.’ So she came, and she has continued from early morning until now, without resting even for a moment.”
8 Then Boʹaz said to Ruth, “Now, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my maidens.
9 Let your eyes be upon the field which they are reaping, and go after them. Have I not charged the young men not to molest you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn.”
10 Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, when I am a foreigner?”
11 But Boʹaz answered her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before.
12 TheLordrecompense you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by theLord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!”
13 Then she said, “You are most gracious to me, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not one of your maidservants.”
14 And at mealtime Boʹaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the wine.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her parched grain; and she ate until she was satisfied, and she had some left over.
15 When she rose to glean, Boʹaz instructed his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.
16 And also pull out some from the bundles for her, and leave it for her to glean, and do not rebuke her.”
17 So she gleaned in the field until evening; then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
18 And she took it up and went into the city; she showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned, and she also brought out and gave her what food she had left over after being satisfied.
19 And her mother-in-law said to her, “Where did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boʹaz.”
20 And Naʹomi said to her daughter-in-law, “Blessed be he by theLord, whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!” Naʹomi also said to her, “The man is a relative of ours, one of our nearest kin.”
21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, “Besides, he said to me, ‘You shall keep close by my servants, till they have finished all my harvest.’ ”
22 And Naʹomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, “It is well, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, lest in another field you be molested.”
23 So she kept close to the maidens of Boʹaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests; and she lived with her mother-in-law.


# Liber Ruth 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Erat autem viro Elimelech consanguineus, homo potens, et magnarum opum, nomine Booz.
2 Dixitque Ruth Moabitis ad socrum suam: Si jubes, vadam in agrum, et colligam spicas quæ fugerint manus metentium, ubicumque clementis in me patrisfamilias reperero gratiam. Cui illa respondit: Vade, filia mea.
3 Abiit itaque et colligebat spicas post terga metentium. Accidit autem ut ager ille haberet dominum nomine Booz, qui erat de cognatione Elimelech.
4 Et ecce, ipse veniebat de Bethlehem, dixitque messoribus: Dominus vobiscum. Qui responderunt ei: Benedicat tibi Dominus.
5 Dixitque Booz juveni, qui messoribus præerat: Cujus est hæc puella?
6 Cui respondit: Hæc est Moabitis, quæ venit cum Noëmi, de regione Moabitide,
7 et rogavit ut spicas colligeret remanentes, sequens messorum vestigia: et de mane usque nunc stat in agro, et ne ad momentum quidem domum reversa est.

8 Et ait Booz ad Ruth: Audi, filia, ne vadas in alterum agrum ad colligendum, nec recedas ab hoc loco: sed jungere puellis meis,
9 et ubi messuerint, sequere. Mandavi enim pueris meis, ut nemo molestus sit tibi: sed etiam si sitieris, vade ad sarcinulas, et bibe aquas, de quibus et pueri bibunt.
10 Quæ cadens in faciem suam et adorans super terram, dixit ad eum: Unde mihi hoc, ut invenirem gratiam ante oculos tuos, et nosse me dignareris peregrinam mulierem?
11 Cui ille respondit: Nuntiata sunt mihi omnia quæ feceris socrui tuæ post mortem viri tui: et quod reliqueris parentes tuos, et terram in qua nata es, et veneris ad populum, quem antea nesciebas.
12 Reddat tibi Dominus pro opere tuo, et plenam mercedem recipias a Domino Deo Israël, ad quem venisti, et sub cujus confugisti alas.
13 Quæ ait: Inveni gratiam apud oculos tuos, domine mi, qui consolatus es me, et locutus es ad cor ancillæ tuæ, quæ non sum similis unius puellarum tuarum.

14 Dixitque ad eam Booz: Quando hora vescendi fuerit, veni huc, et comede panem, et intinge buccellam tuam in aceto. Sedit itaque ad messorum latus, et congessit polentam sibi, comeditque et saturata est, et tulit reliquias.
15 Atque inde surrexit, ut spicas ex more colligeret. Præcepit autem Booz pueris suis, dicens: Etiamsi vobiscum metere voluerit, ne prohibeatis eam:
16 et de vestris quoque manipulis projicite de industria, et remanere permittite, ut absque rubore colligat, et colligentem nemo corripiat.
17 Collegit ergo in agro usque ad vesperam: et quæ collegerat virga cædens et excutiens, invenit hordei quasi ephi mensuram, id est, tres modios.

18 Quos portans reversa est in civitatem, et ostendit socrui suæ: insuper protulit, et dedit ei de reliquiis cibi sui, quo saturata fuerat.
19 Dixitque ei socrus sua: Ubi hodie collegisti, et ubi fecisti opus? sit benedictus qui misertus est tui. Indicavitque ei apud quem fuisset operata: et nomen dixit viri, quod Booz vocaretur.
20 Cui respondit Noëmi: Benedictus sit a Domino: quoniam eamdem gratiam, quam præbuerat vivis, servavit et mortuis. Rursumque ait: Propinquus noster est homo.
21 Et ait Ruth: Hoc quoque, inquit, præcepit mihi, ut tamdiu messoribus ejus jungerer, donec omnes segetes meterentur.
22 Cui dixit socrus: Melius est, filia mea, ut cum puellis ejus exeas ad metendum, ne in alieno agro quispiam resistat tibi.
23 Juncta est itaque puellis Booz: et tamdiu cum eis messuit, donec hordea et triticum in horreis conderentur.

1 καὶ τῇ Νωεμιν ἀνὴρ γνώριμος τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς ὁ δὲ ἀνὴρ δυνατὸς ἰσχύι ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας Αβιμελεχ καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Βοος
2 καὶ εἶπεν Ρουθ ἡ Μωαβῖτις πρὸς Νωεμιν πορευθῶ δὴ εἰς ἀγρὸν καὶ συνάξω ἐν τοῖς στάχυσιν κατόπισθεν οὗ ἐὰν εὕρω χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῇ πορεύου θύγατερ
3 καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ συνέλεξεν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ κατόπισθεν τῶν θεριζόντων καὶ περιέπεσεν περιπτώματι τῇ μερίδι τοῦ ἀγροῦ Βοος τοῦ ἐκ συγγενείας Αβιμελεχ
4 καὶ ἰδοὺ Βοος ἦλθεν ἐκ Βαιθλεεμ καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς θερίζουσιν κύριος με{Q'} ὑμῶν καὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ εὐλογήσαι σε κύριος
5 καὶ εἶπεν Βοος τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὐτοῦ τῷ ἐφεστῶτι ἐπὶ τοὺς θερίζοντας τίνος ἡ νεᾶνις αὕτη
6 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη τὸ παιδάριον τὸ ἐφεστὸς ἐπὶ τοὺς θερίζοντας καὶ εἶπεν ἡ παῖς ἡ Μωαβῖτίς ἐστιν ἡ ἀποστραφεῖσα μετὰ Νωεμιν ἐξ ἀγροῦ Μωαβ
7 καὶ εἶπεν συλλέξω δὴ καὶ συνάξω ἐν τοῖς δράγμασιν ὄπισθεν τῶν θεριζόντων καὶ ἦλθεν καὶ ἔστη ἀπὸ πρωίθεν καὶ ἕως ἑσπέρας οὐ κατέπαυσεν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ μικρόν

8 καὶ εἶπεν Βοος πρὸς Ρουθ οὐκ ἤκουσας θύγατερ μὴ πορευθῇς ἐν ἀγρῷ συλλέξαι ἑτέρῳ καὶ σὺ οὐ πορεύσῃ ἐντεῦθεν ὧδε κολλήθητι μετὰ τῶν κορασίων μου
9 οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου εἰς τὸν ἀγρόν οὗ ἐὰν θερίζωσιν καὶ πορεύσῃ κατόπισθεν αὐτῶν ἰδοὺ ἐνετειλάμην τοῖς παιδαρίοις τοῦ μὴ ἅψασθαί σου καὶ ὅ τι διψήσεις καὶ πορευθήσῃ εἰς τὰ σκεύη καὶ πίεσαι ὅθεν ἂν ὑδρεύωνται τὰ παιδάρια
10 καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς καὶ προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν τί ὅτι εὗρον χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου τοῦ ἐπιγνῶναί με καὶ ἐγώ εἰμι ξένη
11 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Βοος καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ἀπαγγελίᾳ ἀπηγγέλη μοι ὅσα πεποίηκας μετὰ τῆς πενθερᾶς σου μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν τὸν ἄνδρα σου καὶ πῶς κατέλιπες τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα σου καὶ τὴν γῆν γενέσεώς σου καὶ ἐπορεύθης πρὸς λαὸν ὃν οὐκ ᾔδεις ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης
12 ἀποτείσαι κύριος τὴν ἐργασίαν σου καὶ γένοιτο ὁ μισθός σου πλήρης παρὰ κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ πρὸς ὃν ἦλθες πεποιθέναι ὑπὸ τὰς πτέρυγας αὐτοῦ
13 ἡ δὲ εἶπεν εὕροιμι χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου κύριε ὅτι παρεκάλεσάς με καὶ ὅτι ἐλάλησας ἐπὶ καρδίαν τῆς δούλης σου καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἔσομαι ὡς μία τῶν παιδισκῶν σου

14 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Βοος ἤδη ὥρᾳ τοῦ φαγεῖν πρόσελθε ὧδε καὶ φάγεσαι τῶν ἄρτων καὶ βάψεις τὸν ψωμόν σου ἐν τῷ ὄξει καὶ ἐκάθισεν Ρουθ ἐκ πλαγίων τῶν θεριζόντων καὶ ἐβούνισεν αὐτῇ Βοος ἄλφιτον καὶ ἔφαγεν καὶ ἐνεπλήσθη καὶ κατέλιπεν
15 καὶ ἀνέστη τοῦ συλλέγειν καὶ ἐνετείλατο Βοος τοῖς παιδαρίοις αὐτοῦ λέγων καί γε ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν δραγμάτων συλλεγέτω καὶ μὴ καταισχύνητε αὐτήν
16 καὶ βαστάζοντες βαστάξατε αὐτῇ καί γε παραβάλλοντες παραβαλεῖτε αὐτῇ ἐκ τῶν βεβουνισμένων καὶ ἄφετε καὶ συλλέξει καὶ οὐκ ἐπιτιμήσετε αὐτῇ
17 καὶ συνέλεξεν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ ἕως ἑσπέρας καὶ ἐρράβδισεν ἃ συνέλεξεν καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς οιφι κριθῶν

18 καὶ ἦρεν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἶδεν ἡ πενθερὰ αὐτῆς ἃ συνέλεξεν καὶ ἐξενέγκασα Ρουθ ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ ἃ κατέλιπεν ἐξ ὧν ἐνεπλήσθη
19 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ἡ πενθερὰ αὐτῆς ποῦ συνέλεξας σήμερον καὶ ποῦ ἐποίησας εἴη ὁ ἐπιγνούς σε εὐλογημένος καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν Ρουθ τῇ πενθερᾷ αὐτῆς ποῦ ἐποίησεν καὶ εἶπεν τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ ἀνδρός με{Q'} οὗ ἐποίησα σήμερον Βοος
20 καὶ εἶπεν Νωεμιν τῇ νύμφῃ αὐτῆς εὐλογητός ἐστιν τῷ κυρίῳ ὅτι οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπεν τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ζώντων καὶ μετὰ τῶν τεθνηκότων καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Νωεμιν ἐγγίζει ἡμῖν ὁ ἀνὴρ ἐκ τῶν ἀγχιστευόντων ἡμᾶς ἐστιν
21 καὶ εἶπεν Ρουθ πρὸς τὴν πενθερὰν αὐτῆς καί γε ὅτι εἶπεν πρός με μετὰ τῶν παιδαρίων μου προσκολλήθητι ἕως ἂν τελέσωσιν ὅλον τὸν ἀμητόν ὃς ὑπάρχει μοι
22 καὶ εἶπεν Νωεμιν πρὸς Ρουθ τὴν νύμφην αὐτῆς ἀγαθόν θύγατερ ὅτι ἐπορεύθης μετὰ τῶν κορασίων αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἀπαντήσονταί σοι ἐν ἀγρῷ ἑτέρῳ
23 καὶ προσεκολλήθη Ρουθ τοῖς κορασίοις Βοος συλλέγειν ἕως οὗ συνετέλεσεν τὸν θερισμὸν τῶν κριθῶν καὶ τῶν πυρῶν καὶ ἐκάθισεν μετὰ τῆς πενθερᾶς αὐτῆς
