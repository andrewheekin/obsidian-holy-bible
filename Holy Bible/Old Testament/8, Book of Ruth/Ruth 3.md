# Book of Ruth 3 (RSVCE)

### Ruth and Boaz at the Threshing Floor
1 Then Naʹomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, should I not seek a home for you, that it may be well with you?
2 Now is not Boʹaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.
3 Wash therefore and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
4 But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies; then, go and uncover his feet and lie down; and he will tell you what to do.”
5 And she replied, “All that you say I will do.”
6 So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had told her.
7 And when Boʹaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and lay down.
8 At midnight the man was startled, and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet!
9 He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth, your maidservant; spread your skirt over your maidservant, for you are next of kin.”
10 And he said, “May you be blessed by theLord, my daughter; you have made this last kindness greater than the first, in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.
11 And now, my daughter, do not fear, I will do for you all that you ask, for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of worth.
12 And now it is true that I am a near kinsman, yet there is a kinsman nearer than I.
13 Remain this night, and in the morning, if he will do the part of the next of kin for you, well; let him do it; but if he is not willing to do the part of the next of kin for you, then, as theLordlives, I will do the part of the next of kin for you. Lie down until the morning.”
14 So she lay at his feet until the morning, but arose before one could recognize another; and he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”
15 And he said, “Bring the mantle you are wearing and hold it out.” So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley, and laid it upon her; then she went into the city.
16 And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did you fare, my daughter?” Then she told her all that the man had done for her,
17 saying, “These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, ‘You must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’ ”
18 She replied, “Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest, but will settle the matter today.”


# Liber Ruth 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Postquam autem reversa est ad socrum suam, audivit ab ea: Filia mea, quæram tibi requiem, et providebo ut bene sit tibi.
2 Booz iste, cujus puellis in agro juncta es, propinquus noster est, et hac nocte aream hordei ventilat.
3 Lavare igitur, et ungere, et induere cultioribus vestimentis, et descende in aream: non te videat homo, donec esum potumque finierit.
4 Quando autem ierit ad dormiendum, nota locum in quo dormiat: veniesque et discooperies pallium, quo operitur a parte pedum, et projicies te, et ibi jacebis: ipse autem dicet quid agere debeas.

5 Quæ respondit: Quidquid præceperis, faciam.
6 Descenditque in aream, et fecit omnia quæ sibi imperaverat socrus.
7 Cumque comedisset Booz, et bibisset, et factus esset hilarior, issetque ad dormiendum juxta acervum manipulorum, venit abscondite, et discooperto pallio, a pedibus ejus se projecit.
8 Et ecce, nocte jam media expavit homo, et conturbatus est: viditque mulierem jacentem ad pedes suos,
9 et ait illi: Quæ es? Illaque respondit: Ego sum Ruth ancilla tua: expande pallium tuum super famulam tuam, quia propinquus es.
10 Et ille: Benedicta, inquit, es a Domino, filia, et priorem misericordiam posteriore superasti: quia non est secuta juvenes, pauperes sive divites.
11 Noli ergo metuere, sed quidquid dixeris mihi, faciam tibi. Scit enim omnis populus, qui habitat intra portas urbis meæ, mulierem te esse virtutis.
12 Nec abnuo me propinquum, sed est alius me propinquior.
13 Quiesce hac nocte: et facto mane, si te voluerit propinquitatis jure retinere, bene res acta est: sin autem ille noluerit, ego te absque ulla dubitatione suscipiam, vivit Dominus. Dormi usque mane.

14 Dormivit itaque ad pedes ejus, usque ad noctis abscessum. Surrexit itaque antequam homines se cognoscerent mutuo, et dixit Booz: Cave ne quis noverit quod huc veneris.
15 Et rursum: Expande, inquit, pallium tuum, quo operiris, et tene utraque manu. Qua extendente, et tenente, mensus est sex modios hordei, et posuit super eam. Quæ portans ingressa est civitatem,
16 et venit ad socrum suam. Quæ dixit ei: Quid egisti, filia? Narravitque ei omnia, quæ sibi fecisset homo.
17 Et ait: Ecce sex modios hordei dedit mihi, et ait: Nolo vacuam te reverti ad socrum tuam.
18 Dixitque Noëmi: Expecta, filia, donec videamus quem res exitum habeat: neque enim cessabit homo, nisi compleverit quod locutus est.


# Ῥούθ 3 (Septuagint)

1 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῇ Νωεμιν ἡ πενθερὰ αὐτῆς θύγατερ οὐ μὴ ζητήσω σοι ἀνάπαυσιν ἵνα εὖ γένηταί σοι
2 καὶ νῦν οὐχὶ Βοος γνώριμος ἡμῶν οὗ ἦς μετὰ τῶν κορασίων αὐτοῦ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς λικμᾷ τὸν ἅλωνα τῶν κριθῶν ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτί
3 σὺ δὲ λούσῃ καὶ ἀλείψῃ καὶ περιθήσεις τὸν ἱματισμόν σου ἐπὶ σεαυτῇ καὶ ἀναβήσῃ ἐπὶ τὸν ἅλω μὴ γνωρισθῇς τῷ ἀνδρὶ ἕως οὗ συντελέσαι αὐτὸν πιεῖν καὶ φαγεῖν
4 καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ κοιμηθῆναι αὐτόν καὶ γνώσῃ τὸν τόπον ὅπου κοιμᾶται ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐλεύσῃ καὶ ἀποκαλύψεις τὰ πρὸς ποδῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ κοιμηθήσῃ καὶ αὐτὸς ἀπαγγελεῖ σοι ἃ ποιήσεις

5 εἶπεν δὲ Ρουθ πρὸς αὐτήν πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃς ποιήσω
6 καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὸν ἅλω καὶ ἐποίησεν κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο αὐτῇ ἡ πενθερὰ αὐτῆς
7 καὶ ἔφαγεν Βοος καὶ ἠγαθύνθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ καὶ ἦλθεν κοιμηθῆναι ἐν μερίδι τῆς στοιβῆς ἡ δὲ ἦλθεν κρυφῇ καὶ ἀπεκάλυψεν τὰ πρὸς ποδῶν αὐτοῦ
8 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ μεσονυκτίῳ καὶ ἐξέστη ὁ ἀνὴρ καὶ ἐταράχθη καὶ ἰδοὺ γυνὴ κοιμᾶται πρὸς ποδῶν αὐτοῦ
9 εἶπεν δέ τίς εἶ σύ ἡ δὲ εἶπεν ἐγώ εἰμι Ρουθ ἡ δούλη σου καὶ περιβαλεῖς τὸ πτερύγιόν σου ἐπὶ τὴν δούλην σου ὅτι ἀγχιστεὺς εἶ σύ
10 καὶ εἶπεν Βοος εὐλογημένη σὺ τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ θύγατερ ὅτι ἠγάθυνας τὸ ἔλεός σου τὸ ἔσχατον ὑπὲρ τὸ πρῶτον τὸ μὴ πορευθῆναί σε ὀπίσω νεανιῶν εἴτοι πτωχὸς εἴτοι πλούσιος
11 καὶ νῦν θύγατερ μὴ φοβοῦ πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃς ποιήσω σοι οἶδεν γὰρ πᾶσα φυλὴ λαοῦ μου ὅτι γυνὴ δυνάμεως εἶ σύ
12 καὶ ὅτι ἀληθῶς ἀγχιστεὺς ἐγώ εἰμι καί γε ἔστιν ἀγχιστεὺς ἐγγίων ὑπὲρ ἐμέ
13 αὐλίσθητι τὴν νύκτα καὶ ἔσται τὸ πρωί ἐὰν ἀγχιστεύσῃ σε ἀγαθόν ἀγχιστευέτω ἐὰν δὲ μὴ βούληται ἀγχιστεῦσαί σε ἀγχιστεύσω σε ἐγώ ζῇ κύριος κοιμήθητι ἕως πρωί

14 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη πρὸς ποδῶν αὐτοῦ ἕως πρωί ἡ δὲ ἀνέστη πρὸ τοῦ ἐπιγνῶναι ἄνδρα τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν Βοος μὴ γνωσθήτω ὅτι ἦλθεν γυνὴ εἰς τὸν ἅλωνα
15 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ φέρε τὸ περίζωμα τὸ ἐπάνω σου καὶ ἐκράτησεν αὐτό καὶ ἐμέτρησεν ἓξ κριθῶν καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐ{P'} αὐτήν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν
16 καὶ Ρουθ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς τὴν πενθερὰν αὐτῆς ἡ δὲ εἶπεν τίς εἶ θύγατερ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν αὐτῇ ὁ ἀνήρ
17 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ τὰ ἓξ τῶν κριθῶν ταῦτα ἔδωκέν μοι ὅτι εἶπεν πρός με μὴ εἰσέλθῃς κενὴ πρὸς τὴν πενθεράν σου
18 ἡ δὲ εἶπεν κάθου θύγατερ ἕως τοῦ ἐπιγνῶναί σε πῶς οὐ πεσεῖται ῥῆμα οὐ γὰρ μὴ ἡσυχάσῃ ὁ ἀνήρ ἕως ἂν τελέσῃ τὸ ῥῆμα σήμερον
