# Book of Exodus 7 (RSVCE)

1 And theLordsaid to Moses, “See, I make you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.
2 You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land.
3 But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
4 Pharaoh will not listen to you; then I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth my hosts, my people the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am theLord, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them.”
6 And Moses and Aaron did so; they did as theLordcommanded them.
7 Now Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
### Aaron’s Miraculous Rod
8 And theLordsaid to Moses and Aaron,
9 “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Prove yourselves by working a miracle,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.’ ”
10 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as theLordcommanded; Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.
11 Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same by their secret arts.
12 For every man cast down his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.
13 Still Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them; as theLordhad said.
### The First Plague: Water Turned to Blood
14 Then theLordsaid to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is hardened, he refuses to let the people go.
15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water; wait for him by the river’s brink, and take in your hand the rod which was turned into a serpent.
16 And you shall say to him, ‘TheLord, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, “Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness; and behold, you have not yet obeyed.”
17 Thus says theLord, “By this you shall know that I am theLord: behold, I will strike the water that is in the Nile with the rod that is in my hand, and it shall be turned to blood,
18 and the fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile shall become foul, and the Egyptians will loathe to drink water from the Nile.” ’ ”
19 And theLordsaid to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, their canals, and their ponds, and all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’ ”
20 Moses and Aaron did as theLordcommanded; in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, he lifted up the rod and struck the water that was in the Nile, and all the water that was in the Nile turned to blood.
21 And the fish in the Nile died; and the Nile became foul, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
22 But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts; so Pharaoh’s heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them; as theLordhad said.
23 Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not lay even this to heart.
24 And all the Egyptians dug round about the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile.
### The Second Plague: Frogs
25 Seven days passed after theLordhad struck the Nile.


# Liber Exodus 7 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dixitque Dominus ad Moysen: Ecce constitui te Deum Pharaonis: et Aaron frater tuus erit propheta tuus.
2 Tu loqueris ei omnia quæ mando tibi: et ille loquetur ad Pharaonem, ut dimittat filios Israël de terra sua.
3 Sed ego indurabo cor ejus, et multiplicabo signa et ostenta mea in terra Ægypti,
4 et non audiet vos: immittamque manum meam super Ægyptum, et educam exercitum et populum meum filios Israël de terra Ægypti per judicia maxima.
5 Et scient Ægyptii quia ego sum Dominus qui extenderim manum meam super Ægyptum, et eduxerim filios Israël de medio eorum.
6 Fecit itaque Moyses et Aaron sicut præceperat Dominus: ita egerunt.
7 Erat autem Moyses octoginta annorum, et Aaron octoginta trium, quando locuti sunt ad Pharaonem.

8 Dixitque Dominus ad Moysen et Aaron:
9 Cum dixerit vobis Pharao, Ostendite signa: dices ad Aaron: Tolle virgam tuam, et projice eam coram Pharaone, ac vertetur in colubrum.
10 Ingressi itaque Moyses et Aaron ad Pharaonem, fecerunt sicut præceperat Dominus: tulitque Aaron virgam coram Pharaone et servis ejus, quæ versa est in colubrum.
11 Vocavit autem Pharao sapientes et maleficos: et fecerunt etiam ipsi per incantationes ægyptiacas et arcana quædam similiter.
12 Projeceruntque singuli virgas suas, quæ versæ sunt in dracones: sed devoravit virga Aaron virgas eorum.
13 Induratumque est cor Pharaonis, et non audivit eos, sicut præceperat Dominus.

14 Dixit autem Dominus ad Moysen: Ingravatum est cor Pharaonis: non vult dimittere populum.
15 Vade ad eum mane, ecce egredietur ad aquas: et stabis in occursum ejus super ripam fluminis: et virgam quæ conversa est in draconem, tolles in manu tua.
16 Dicesque ad eum: Dominus Deus Hebræorum misit me ad te, dicens: Dimitte populum meum ut sacrificet mihi in deserto: et usque ad præsens audire noluisti.
17 Hæc igitur dicit Dominus: In hoc scies quod sim Dominus: ecce percutiam virga, quæ in manu mea est, aquam fluminis, et vertetur in sanguinem.
18 Pisces quoque, qui sunt in fluvio, morientur, et computrescent aquæ, et affligentur Ægyptii bibentes aquam fluminis.
19 Dixit quoque Dominus ad Moysen: Dic ad Aaron: Tolle virgam tuam, et extende manum tuam super aquas Ægypti, et super fluvios eorum, et rivos ac paludes, et omnes lacus aquarum, ut vertantur in sanguinem: et sit cruor in omni terra Ægypti, tam in ligneis vasis quam in saxeis.
20 Feceruntque Moyses et Aaron sicut præceperat Dominus: et elevans virgam percussit aquam fluminis coram Pharaone et servis ejus: quæ versa est in sanguinem.
21 Et pisces, qui erant in flumine, mortui sunt: computruitque fluvius, et non poterant Ægyptii bibere aquam fluminis, et fuit sanguis in tota terra Ægypti.
22 Feceruntque similiter malefici Ægyptiorum incantationibus suis: et induratum est cor Pharaonis, nec audivit eos, sicut præceperat Dominus.
23 Avertitque se, et ingressus est domum suam, nec apposuit cor etiam hac vice.
24 Foderunt autem omnes Ægyptii per circuitum fluminis aquam ut biberent: non enim poterant bibere de aqua fluminis.
25 Impletique sunt septem dies, postquam percussit Dominus fluvium.

1 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων ἰδοὺ δέδωκά σε θεὸν Φαραω καὶ Ααρων ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἔσται σου προφήτης
2 σὺ δὲ λαλήσεις αὐτῷ πάντα ὅσα σοι ἐντέλλομαι ὁ δὲ Ααρων ὁ ἀδελφός σου λαλήσει πρὸς Φαραω ὥστε ἐξαποστεῖλαι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ ἐκ τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ
3 ἐγὼ δὲ σκληρυνῶ τὴν καρδίαν Φαραω καὶ πληθυνῶ τὰ σημεῖά μου καὶ τὰ τέρατα ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ
4 καὶ οὐκ εἰσακούσεται ὑμῶν Φαραω καὶ ἐπιβαλῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐ{P'} Αἴγυπτον καὶ ἐξάξω σὺν δυνάμει μου τὸν λαόν μου τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου σὺν ἐκδικήσει μεγάλῃ
5 καὶ γνώσονται πάντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι κύριος ἐκτείνων τὴν χεῖρα ἐ{P'} Αἴγυπτον καὶ ἐξάξω τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν
6 ἐποίησεν δὲ Μωυσῆς καὶ Ααρων καθάπερ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς κύριος οὕτως ἐποίησαν
7 Μωυσῆς δὲ ἦν ἐτῶν ὀγδοήκοντα Ααρων δὲ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐτῶν ὀγδοήκοντα τριῶν ἡνίκα ἐλάλησεν πρὸς Φαραω

8 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ααρων λέγων
9 καὶ ἐὰν λαλήσῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς Φαραω λέγων δότε ἡμῖν σημεῖον ἢ τέρας καὶ ἐρεῖς Ααρων τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου λαβὲ τὴν ῥάβδον καὶ ῥῖψον αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐναντίον Φαραω καὶ ἐναντίον τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔσται δράκων
10 εἰσῆλθεν δὲ Μωυσῆς καὶ Ααρων ἐναντίον Φαραω καὶ τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως καθάπερ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς κύριος καὶ ἔρριψεν Ααρων τὴν ῥάβδον ἐναντίον Φαραω καὶ ἐναντίον τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγένετο δράκων
11 συνεκάλεσεν δὲ Φαραω τοὺς σοφιστὰς Αἰγύπτου καὶ τοὺς φαρμακούς καὶ ἐποίησαν καὶ οἱ ἐπαοιδοὶ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ταῖς φαρμακείαις αὐτῶν ὡσαύτως
12 καὶ ἔρριψαν ἕκαστος τὴν ῥάβδον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγένοντο δράκοντες καὶ κατέπιεν ἡ ῥάβδος ἡ Ααρων τὰς ἐκείνων ῥάβδους
13 καὶ κατίσχυσεν ἡ καρδία Φαραω καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν καθάπερ ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς κύριος

14 εἶπεν δὲ κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν βεβάρηται ἡ καρδία Φαραω τοῦ μὴ ἐξαποστεῖλαι τὸν λαόν
15 βάδισον πρὸς Φαραω τὸ πρωί ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἐκπορεύεται ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ στήσῃ συναντῶν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖλος τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν στραφεῖσαν εἰς ὄφιν λήμψῃ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου
16 καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτόν κύριος ὁ θεὸς τῶν Εβραίων ἀπέσταλκέν με πρὸς σὲ λέγων ἐξαπόστειλον τὸν λαόν μου ἵνα μοι λατρεύσῃ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ εἰσήκουσας ἕως τούτου
17 τάδε λέγει κύριος ἐν τούτῳ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ κύριος ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ τύπτω τῇ ῥάβδῳ τῇ ἐν τῇ χειρί μου ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ καὶ μεταβαλεῖ εἰς αἷμα
18 καὶ οἱ ἰχθύες οἱ ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ τελευτήσουσιν καὶ ἐποζέσει ὁ ποταμός καὶ οὐ δυνήσονται οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι πιεῖν ὕδωρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ
19 εἶπεν δὲ κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν εἰπὸν Ααρων τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου λαβὲ τὴν ῥάβδον σου καὶ ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐπὶ τὰ ὕδατα Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ποταμοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς διώρυγας αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἕλη αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν συνεστηκὸς ὕδωρ αὐτῶν καὶ ἔσται αἷμα καὶ ἐγένετο αἷμα ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου ἔν τε τοῖς ξύλοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς λίθοις
20 καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως Μωυσῆς καὶ Ααρων καθάπερ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς κύριος καὶ ἐπάρας τῇ ῥάβδῳ αὐτοῦ ἐπάταξεν τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ ἐναντίον Φαραω καὶ ἐναντίον τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ καὶ μετέβαλεν πᾶν τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ εἰς αἷμα
21 καὶ οἱ ἰχθύες οἱ ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ ἐτελεύτησαν καὶ ἐπώζεσεν ὁ ποταμός καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι πιεῖν ὕδωρ ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ ἦν τὸ αἷμα ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου
22 ἐποίησαν δὲ ὡσαύτως καὶ οἱ ἐπαοιδοὶ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ταῖς φαρμακείαις αὐτῶν καὶ ἐσκληρύνθη ἡ καρδία Φαραω καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν καθάπερ εἶπεν κύριος
23 ἐπιστραφεὶς δὲ Φαραω εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐπέστησεν τὸν νοῦν αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τούτῳ
24 ὤρυξαν δὲ πάντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι κύκλῳ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ὥστε πιεῖν ὕδωρ καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο πιεῖν ὕδωρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ
25 καὶ ἀνεπληρώθησαν ἑπτὰ ἡμέραι μετὰ τὸ πατάξαι κύριον τὸν ποταμόν
