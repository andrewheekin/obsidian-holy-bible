# Book of Exodus 4 (RSVCE)

### Moses’ Miraculous Power
1 Then Moses answered, “But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, ‘TheLorddid not appear to you.’ ”
2 TheLordsaid to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A rod.”
3 And he said, “Cast it on the ground.” So he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it.
4 But theLordsaid to Moses, “Put out your hand, and take it by the tail”—so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand—
5 “that they may believe that theLord, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”
6 Again, theLordsaid to him, “Put your hand into your bosom.” And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.
7 Then God said, “Put your hand back into your bosom.” So he put his hand back into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.
8 “If they will not believe you,” God said, “or heed the first sign, they may believe the latter sign.
9 If they will not believe even these two signs or heed your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it upon the dry ground; and the water which you shall take from the Nile will become blood upon the dry ground.”
10 But Moses said to theLord, “Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either heretofore or since thou hast spoken to thy servant; but I am slow of speech and of tongue.”
11 Then theLordsaid to him, “Who has made man’s mouth? Who makes him dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, theLord?
12 Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.”
13 But he said, “Oh, my Lord, send, I pray, some other person.”
14 Then the anger of theLordwas kindled against Moses and he said, “Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well; and behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart.
15 And you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.
16 He shall speak for you to the people; and he shall be a mouth for you, and you shall be to him as God.
17 And you shall take in your hand this rod, with which you shall do the signs.”
### Moses Returns to Egypt
18 Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me go back, I pray, to my kinsmen in Egypt and see whether they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”
19 And theLordsaid to Moses in Midʹian, “Go back to Egypt; for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.”
20 So Moses took his wife and his sons and set them on an ass, and went back to the land of Egypt; and in his hand Moses took the rod of God.
21 And theLordsaid to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.
22 And you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says theLord, Israel is my first-born son,
23 and I say to you, “Let my son go that he may serve me”; if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your first-born son.’ ”
24 At a lodging place on the way theLordmet him and sought to kill him.
25 Then Zippoʹrah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin, and touched Moses’ feet with it, and said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!”
26 So he let him alone. Then it was that she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.
27 TheLordsaid to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went, and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of theLordwith which he had sent him, and all the signs which he had charged him to do.
29 Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel.
30 And Aaron spoke all the words which theLordhad spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.
31 And the people believed; and when they heard that theLordhad visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped.


# Liber Exodus 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Respondens Moyses ait: Non credent mihi, neque audient vocem meam, sed dicent: Non apparuit tibi Dominus.
2 Dixit ergo ad eum: Quid est quod tenes in manu tua? Respondit: Virga.
3 Dixitque Dominus: Projice eam in terram. Projecit, et versa est in colubrum, ita ut fugeret Moyses.
4 Dixitque Dominus: Extende manum tuam, et apprehende caudam ejus. Extendit, et tenuit, versaque est in virgam.
5 Ut credant, inquit, quod apparuerit tibi Dominus Deus patrum suorum, Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac et Deus Jacob.
6 Dixitque Dominus rursum: Mitte manum tuam in sinum tuum. Quam cum misisset in sinum, protulit leprosam instar nivis.
7 Retrahe, ait, manum tuam in sinum tuum. Retraxit, et protulit iterum, et erat similis carni reliquæ.
8 Si non crediderint, inquit, tibi, neque audierint sermonem signi prioris, credent verbo signi sequentis.
9 Quod si nec duobus quidem his signis crediderint, neque audierint vocem tuam: sume aquam fluminis, et effunde eam super aridam, et quidquid hauseris de fluvio, vertetur in sanguinem.

10 Ait Moyses: Obsecro, Domine, non sum eloquens ab heri et nudiustertius: et ex quo locutus es ad servum tuum, impeditioris et tardioris linguæ sum.
11 Dixit Dominus ad eum: Quis fecit os hominis? aut quis fabricatus est mutum et surdum, videntem et cæcum? nonne ego?
12 Perge, igitur, et ego ero in ore tuo: doceboque te quid loquaris.
13 At ille: Obsecro, inquit, Domine, mitte quem missurus es.
14 Iratus Dominus in Moysen, ait: Aaron frater tuus Levites, scio quod eloquens sit: ecce ipse egreditur in occursum tuum, vidensque te lætabitur corde.
15 Loquere ad eum, et pone verba mea in ore ejus: et ego ero in ore tuo, et in ore illius, et ostendam vobis quid agere debeatis.
16 Ipse loquetur pro te ad populum, et erit os tuum: tu autem eris ei in his quæ ad Deum pertinent.
17 Virgam quoque hanc sume in manu tua, in qua facturus es signa.

18 Abiit Moyses, et reversus est ad Jethro socerum suum, dixitque ei: Vadam et revertar ad fratres meos in Ægyptum, ut videam si adhuc vivant. Cui ait Jethro: Vade in pace.
19 Dixit ergo Dominus ad Moysen in Madian: Vade, et revertere in Ægyptum, mortui sunt enim omnes qui quærebant animam tuam.
20 Tulit ergo Moyses uxorem suam, et filios suos, et imposuit eos super asinum: reversusque est in Ægyptum, portans virgam Dei in manu sua.
21 Dixitque ei Dominus revertenti in Ægyptum: Vide ut omnia ostenta quæ posui in manu tua, facias coram Pharaone: ego indurabo cor ejus, et non dimittet populum.
22 Dicesque ad eum: Hæc dicit Dominus: Filius meus primogenitus Israël.
23 Dixi tibi: Dimitte filium meum ut serviat mihi; et noluisti dimittere eum: ecce ego interficiam filium tuum primogenitum.

24 Cumque esset in itinere, in diversorio occurrit ei Dominus, et volebat occidere eum.
25 Tulit idcirco Sephora acutissimam petram, et circumcidit præputium filii sui, tetigitque pedes ejus, et ait: Sponsus sanguinum tu mihi es.
26 Et dimisit eum postquam dixerat: Sponsus sanguinum ob circumcisionem.

27 Dixit autem Dominus ad Aaron: Vade in occursum Moysi in desertum. Qui perrexit obviam ei in montem Dei, et osculatus est eum.
28 Narravitque Moyses Aaron omnia verba Domini quibus miserat eum, et signa quæ mandaverat.
29 Veneruntque simul, et congregaverunt cunctos seniores filiorum Israël.
30 Locutusque est Aaron omnia verba quæ dixerat Dominus ad Moysen: et fecit signa coram populo,
31 et credidit populus. Audieruntque quod visitasset Dominus filios Israël, et respexisset afflictionem illorum: et proni adoraverunt.


# Ἔξοδος 4 (Septuagint)

1 ἀπεκρίθη δὲ Μωυσῆς καὶ εἶπεν ἐὰν οὖν μὴ πιστεύσωσίν μοι μηδὲ εἰσακούσωσιν τῆς φωνῆς μου ἐροῦσιν γὰρ ὅτι οὐκ ὦπταί σοι ὁ θεός τί ἐρῶ πρὸς αὐτούς
2 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ κύριος τί τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ῥάβδος
3 καὶ εἶπεν ῥῖψον αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ ἔρριψεν αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ ἐγένετο ὄφις καὶ ἔφυγεν Μωυσῆς ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
4 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρα καὶ ἐπιλαβοῦ τῆς κέρκου ἐκτείνας οὖν τὴν χεῖρα ἐπελάβετο τῆς κέρκου καὶ ἐγένετο ῥάβδος ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ
5 ἵνα πιστεύσωσίν σοι ὅτι ὦπταί σοι κύριος ὁ θεὸς τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν θεὸς Αβρααμ καὶ θεὸς Ισαακ καὶ θεὸς Ιακωβ
6 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ κύριος πάλιν εἰσένεγκε τὴν χεῖρά σου εἰς τὸν κόλπον σου καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν κόλπον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξήνεγκεν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐκ τοῦ κόλπου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγενήθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ χιών
7 καὶ εἶπεν πάλιν εἰσένεγκε τὴν χεῖρά σου εἰς τὸν κόλπον σου καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν τὴν χεῖρα εἰς τὸν κόλπον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξήνεγκεν αὐτὴν ἐκ τοῦ κόλπου αὐτοῦ καὶ πάλιν ἀπεκατέστη εἰς τὴν χρόαν τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ
8 ἐὰν δὲ μὴ πιστεύσωσίν σοι μηδὲ εἰσακούσωσιν τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ σημείου τοῦ πρώτου πιστεύσουσίν σοι τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ σημείου τοῦ ἐσχάτου
9 καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν μὴ πιστεύσωσίν σοι τοῖς δυσὶ σημείοις τούτοις μηδὲ εἰσακούσωσιν τῆς φωνῆς σου λήμψῃ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ ἐκχεεῖς ἐπὶ τὸ ξηρόν καὶ ἔσται τὸ ὕδωρ ὃ ἐὰν λάβῃς ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ αἷμα ἐπὶ τοῦ ξηροῦ

10 εἶπεν δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς κύριον δέομαι κύριε οὐχ ἱκανός εἰμι πρὸ τῆς ἐχθὲς οὐδὲ πρὸ τῆς τρίτης ἡμέρας οὐδὲ ἀ{F'} οὗ ἤρξω λαλεῖν τῷ θεράποντί σου ἰσχνόφωνος καὶ βραδύγλωσσος ἐγώ εἰμι
11 εἶπεν δὲ κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν τίς ἔδωκεν στόμα ἀνθρώπῳ καὶ τίς ἐποίησεν δύσκωφον καὶ κωφόν βλέποντα καὶ τυφλόν οὐκ ἐγὼ ὁ θεός
12 καὶ νῦν πορεύου καὶ ἐγὼ ἀνοίξω τὸ στόμα σου καὶ συμβιβάσω σε ὃ μέλλεις λαλῆσαι
13 καὶ εἶπεν Μωυσῆς δέομαι κύριε προχείρισαι δυνάμενον ἄλλον ὃν ἀποστελεῖς
14 καὶ θυμωθεὶς ὀργῇ κύριος ἐπὶ Μωυσῆν εἶπεν οὐκ ἰδοὺ Ααρων ὁ ἀδελφός σου ὁ Λευίτης ἐπίσταμαι ὅτι λαλῶν λαλήσει αὐτός σοι καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἐξελεύσεται εἰς συνάντησίν σοι καὶ ἰδών σε χαρήσεται ἐν ἑαυτῷ
15 καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ δώσεις τὰ ῥήματά μου εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγὼ ἀνοίξω τὸ στόμα σου καὶ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ καὶ συμβιβάσω ὑμᾶς ἃ ποιήσετε
16 καὶ αὐτός σοι προσλαλήσει πρὸς τὸν λαόν καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται σου στόμα σὺ δὲ αὐτῷ ἔσῃ τὰ πρὸς τὸν θεόν
17 καὶ τὴν ῥάβδον ταύτην τὴν στραφεῖσαν εἰς ὄφιν λήμψῃ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου ἐν ᾗ ποιήσεις ἐν αὐτῇ τὰ σημεῖα

18 ἐπορεύθη δὲ Μωυσῆς καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν πρὸς Ιοθορ τὸν γαμβρὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ λέγει πορεύσομαι καὶ ἀποστρέψω πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφούς μου τοὺς ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ὄψομαι εἰ ἔτι ζῶσιν καὶ εἶπεν Ιοθορ Μωυσῇ βάδιζε ὑγιαίνων
19 μετὰ δὲ τὰς ἡμέρας τὰς πολλὰς ἐκείνας ἐτελεύτησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου εἶπεν δὲ κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν ἐν Μαδιαμ βάδιζε ἄπελθε εἰς Αἴγυπτον τεθνήκασιν γὰρ πάντες οἱ ζητοῦντές σου τὴν ψυχήν
20 ἀναλαβὼν δὲ Μωυσῆς τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τὰ παιδία ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὰ ἐπὶ τὰ ὑποζύγια καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἔλαβεν δὲ Μωυσῆς τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ
21 εἶπεν δὲ κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν πορευομένου σου καὶ ἀποστρέφοντος εἰς Αἴγυπτον ὅρα πάντα τὰ τέρατα ἃ ἔδωκα ἐν ταῖς χερσίν σου ποιήσεις αὐτὰ ἐναντίον Φαραω ἐγὼ δὲ σκληρυνῶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξαποστείλῃ τὸν λαόν
22 σὺ δὲ ἐρεῖς τῷ Φαραω τάδε λέγει κύριος υἱὸς πρωτότοκός μου Ισραηλ
23 εἶπα δέ σοι ἐξαπόστειλον τὸν λαόν μου ἵνα μοι λατρεύσῃ εἰ μὲν οὖν μὴ βούλει ἐξαποστεῖλαι αὐτούς ὅρα οὖν ἐγὼ ἀποκτενῶ τὸν υἱόν σου τὸν πρωτότοκον

24 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἐν τῷ καταλύματι συνήντησεν αὐτῷ ἄγγελος κυρίου καὶ ἐζήτει αὐτὸν ἀποκτεῖναι
25 καὶ λαβοῦσα Σεπφωρα ψῆφον περιέτεμεν τὴν ἀκροβυστίαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς καὶ προσέπεσεν πρὸς τοὺς πόδας καὶ εἶπεν ἔστη τὸ αἷμα τῆς περιτομῆς τοῦ παιδίου μου
26 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ διότι εἶπεν ἔστη τὸ αἷμα τῆς περιτομῆς τοῦ παιδίου μου

27 εἶπεν δὲ κύριος πρὸς Ααρων πορεύθητι εἰς συνάντησιν Μωυσεῖ εἰς τὴν ἔρημον καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ συνήντησεν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ ὄρει τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ κατεφίλησαν ἀλλήλους
28 καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν Μωυσῆς τῷ Ααρων πάντας τοὺς λόγους κυρίου οὓς ἀπέστειλεν καὶ πάντα τὰ σημεῖα ἃ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ
29 ἐπορεύθη δὲ Μωυσῆς καὶ Ααρων καὶ συνήγαγον τὴν γερουσίαν τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ
30 καὶ ἐλάλησεν Ααρων πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα ἃ ἐλάλησεν ὁ θεὸς πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ ἐποίησεν τὰ σημεῖα ἐναντίον τοῦ λαοῦ
31 καὶ ἐπίστευσεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ ἐχάρη ὅτι ἐπεσκέψατο ὁ θεὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ καὶ ὅτι εἶδεν αὐτῶν τὴν θλῖψιν κύψας δὲ ὁ λαὸς προσεκύνησεν
