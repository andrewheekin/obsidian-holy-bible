# Book of Exodus 32 (RSVCE)

### The Golden Calf
1 When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, “Up, make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”
2 And Aaron said to them, “Take off the rings of gold which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.”
3 So all the people took off the rings of gold which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
4 And he received the gold at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made a molten calf; and they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”
5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to theLord.”
6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
7 And theLordsaid to Moses, “Go down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves;
8 they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!’ ”
9 And theLordsaid to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people;
10 now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them; but of you I will make a great nation.”
11 But Moses besought theLordhis God, and said, “OLord, why does thy wrath burn hot against thy people, whom thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
12 Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou didst swear by thine own self, and didst say to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it for ever.’ ”
14 And theLordrepented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.
15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mountain with the two tables of the testimony in his hands, tables that were written on both sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
17 When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a noise of war in the camp.”
18 But he said, “It is not the sound of shouting for victory, or the sound of the cry of defeat, but the sound of singing that I hear.”
19 And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses’ anger burned hot, and he threw the tables out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the water, and made the people of Israel drink it.
21 And Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought a great sin upon them?”
22 And Aaron said, “Let not the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they are set on evil.
23 For they said to me, ‘Make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’
24 And I said to them, ‘Let any who have gold take it off’; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and there came out this calf.”
25 And when Moses saw that the people had broken loose (for Aaron had let them break loose, to their shame among their enemies),
26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Who is on theLord’s side? Come to me.” And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.
27 And he said to them, “Thus says theLord Godof Israel, ‘Put every man his sword on his side, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.’ ”
28 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
29 And Moses said, “Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of theLord, each one at the cost of his son and of his brother, that he may bestow a blessing upon you this day.”
30 On the morrow Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to theLord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”
31 So Moses returned to theLordand said, “Alas, this people have sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold.
32 But now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.”
33 But theLordsaid to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
34 But now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you; behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.”
35 And theLordsent a plague upon the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made.


# Liber Exodus 32 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Videns autem populus quod moram faceret descendendi de monte Moyses, congregatus adversus Aaron, dixit: Surge, fac nobis deos, qui nos præcedant: Moysi enim huic viro, qui nos eduxit de terra Ægypti, ignoramus quid acciderit.
2 Dixitque ad eos Aaron: Tollite inaures aureas de uxorum, filiorumque et filiarum vestrarum auribus, et afferte ad me.
3 Fecitque populus quæ jusserat, deferens inaures ad Aaron.
4 Quas cum ille accepisset, formavit opere fusorio, et fecit ex eis vitulum conflatilem: dixeruntque: Hi sunt dii tui Israël, qui te eduxerunt de terra Ægypti.
5 Quod cum vidisset Aaron, ædificavit altare coram eo, et præconis voce clamavit dicens: Cras solemnitas Domini est.
6 Surgentesque mane, obtulerunt holocausta, et hostias pacificas, et sedit populus manducare, et bibere, et surrexerunt ludere.

7 Locutus est autem Dominus ad Moysen, dicens: Vade, descende: peccavit populus tuus, quem eduxisti de terra Ægypti.
8 Recesserunt cito de via, quam ostendisti eis: feceruntque sibi vitulum conflatilem, et adoraverunt, atque immolantes ei hostias, dixerunt: Isti sunt dii tui Israël, qui te eduxerunt de terra Ægypti.
9 Rursumque ait Dominus ad Moysen: Cerno quod populus iste duræ cervicis sit:
10 dimitte me, ut irascatur furor meus contra eos, et deleam eos, faciamque te in gentem magnam.
11 Moyses autem orabat Dominum Deum suum, dicens: Cur, Domine, irascitur furor tuus contra populum tuum, quem eduxisti de terra Ægypti, in fortitudine magna, et in manu robusta?
12 Ne quæso dicant Ægyptii: Callide eduxit eos, ut interficeret in montibus, et deleret e terra: quiescat ira tua, et esto placabilis super nequitia populi tui.
13 Recordare Abraham, Isaac, et Israël servorum tuorum, quibus jurasti per temetipsum, dicens: Multiplicabo semen vestrum sicut stellas cæli; et universam terram hanc, de qua locutus sum, dabo semini vestro, et possidebitis eam semper.
14 Placatusque est Dominus ne faceret malum quod locutus fuerat adversus populum suum.

15 Et reversus est Moyses de monte, portans duas tabulas testimonii in manu sua, scriptas ex utraque parte,
16 et factas opere Dei: scriptura quoque Dei erat sculpta in tabulis.
17 Audiens autem Josue tumultum populi vociferantis, dixit ad Moysen: Ululatus pugnæ auditur in castris.
18 Qui respondit: Non est clamor adhortantium ad pugnam, neque vociferatio compellentium ad fugam: sed vocem cantantium ego audio.
19 Cumque appropinquasset ad castra, vidit vitulum, et choros: iratusque valde, projecit de manu tabulas, et confregit eas ad radicem montis:
20 arripiensque vitulum quem fecerant, combussit, et contrivit usque ad pulverem, quem sparsit in aquam, et dedit ex eo potum filiis Israël.
21 Dixitque ad Aaron: Quid tibi fecit hic populus, ut induceres super eum peccatum maximum?
22 Cui ille respondit: Ne indignetur dominus meus: tu enim nosti populum istum, quod pronus sit ad malum:
23 dixerunt mihi: Fac nobis deos, qui nos præcedant: huic enim Moysi, qui nos eduxit de terra Ægypti, nescimus quid acciderit.
24 Quibus ego dixi: Quis vestrum habet aurum? Tulerunt, et dederunt mihi: et projeci illud in ignem, egressusque est hic vitulus.

25 Videns ergo Moyses populum quod esset nudatus (spoliaverat enim eum Aaron propter ignominiam sordis, et inter hostes nudum constituerat),
26 et stans in porta castrorum, ait: Si quis est Domini, jungatur mihi. Congregatique sunt ad eum omnes filii Levi:
27 quibus ait: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Ponat vir gladium super femur suum: ite, et redite de porta usque ad portam per medium castrorum, et occidat unusquisque fratrem, et amicum, et proximum suum.
28 Feceruntque filii Levi juxta sermonem Moysi, cecideruntque in die illa quasi viginti tria millia hominum.
29 Et ait Moyses: Consecrastis manus vestras hodie Domino, unusquisque in filio, et in fratre suo, ut detur vobis benedictio.

30 Facto autem altero die, locutus est Moyses ad populum: Peccastis peccatum maximum: ascendam ad Dominum, si quomodo quivero eum deprecari pro scelere vestro.
31 Reversusque ad Dominum, ait: Obsecro, peccavit populus iste peccatum maximum, feceruntque sibi deos aureos: aut dimitte eis hanc noxam,
32 aut si non facis, dele me de libro tuo quem scripsisti.
33 Cui respondit Dominus: Qui peccaverit mihi, delebo eum de libro meo:
34 tu autem vade, et duc populum istum quo locutus sum tibi: angelus meus præcedet te. Ego autem in die ultionis visitabo et hoc peccatum eorum.

35 Percussit ergo Dominus populum pro reatu vituli, quem fecerat Aaron.

1 καὶ ἰδὼν ὁ λαὸς ὅτι κεχρόνικεν Μωυσῆς καταβῆναι ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους συνέστη ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ Ααρων καὶ λέγουσιν αὐτῷ ἀνάστηθι καὶ ποίησον ἡμῖν θεούς οἳ προπορεύσονται ἡμῶν ὁ γὰρ Μωυσῆς οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἐξήγαγεν ἡμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου οὐκ οἴδαμεν τί γέγονεν αὐτῷ
2 καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς Ααρων περιέλεσθε τὰ ἐνώτια τὰ χρυσᾶ τὰ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν τῶν γυναικῶν ὑμῶν καὶ θυγατέρων καὶ ἐνέγκατε πρός με
3 καὶ περιείλαντο πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὰ ἐνώτια τὰ χρυσᾶ τὰ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν αὐτῶν καὶ ἤνεγκαν πρὸς Ααρων
4 καὶ ἐδέξατο ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔπλασεν αὐτὰ ἐν τῇ γραφίδι καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὰ μόσχον χωνευτὸν καὶ εἶπεν οὗτοι οἱ θεοί σου Ισραηλ οἵτινες ἀνεβίβασάν σε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου
5 καὶ ἰδὼν Ααρων ᾠκοδόμησεν θυσιαστήριον κατέναντι αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκήρυξεν Ααρων λέγων ἑορτὴ τοῦ κυρίου αὔριον
6 καὶ ὀρθρίσας τῇ ἐπαύριον ἀνεβίβασεν ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ προσήνεγκεν θυσίαν σωτηρίου καὶ ἐκάθισεν ὁ λαὸς φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν καὶ ἀνέστησαν παίζειν

7 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων βάδιζε τὸ τάχος ἐντεῦθεν κατάβηθι ἠνόμησεν γὰρ ὁ λαός σου οὓς ἐξήγαγες ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου
8 παρέβησαν ταχὺ ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ ἧς ἐνετείλω αὐτοῖς ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς μόσχον καὶ προσκεκυνήκασιν αὐτῷ καὶ τεθύκασιν αὐτῷ καὶ εἶπαν οὗτοι οἱ θεοί σου Ισραηλ οἵτινες ἀνεβίβασάν σε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου
9 
10 καὶ νῦν ἔασόν με καὶ θυμωθεὶς ὀργῇ εἰς αὐτοὺς ἐκτρίψω αὐτοὺς καὶ ποιήσω σὲ εἰς ἔθνος μέγα
11 καὶ ἐδεήθη Μωυσῆς ἔναντι κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ἵνα τί κύριε θυμοῖ ὀργῇ εἰς τὸν λαόν σου οὓς ἐξήγαγες ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐν ἰσχύι μεγάλῃ καὶ ἐν τῷ βραχίονί σου τῷ ὑψηλῷ
12 μήποτε εἴπωσιν οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι λέγοντες μετὰ πονηρίας ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ἀποκτεῖναι ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν καὶ ἐξαναλῶσαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς παῦσαι τῆς ὀργῆς τοῦ θυμοῦ σου καὶ ἵλεως γενοῦ ἐπὶ τῇ κακίᾳ τοῦ λαοῦ σου
13 μνησθεὶς Αβρααμ καὶ Ισαακ καὶ Ιακωβ τῶν σῶν οἰκετῶν οἷς ὤμοσας κατὰ σεαυτοῦ καὶ ἐλάλησας πρὸς αὐτοὺς λέγων πολυπληθυνῶ τὸ σπέρμα ὑμῶν ὡσεὶ τὰ ἄστρα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τῷ πλήθει καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ταύτην ἣν εἶπας δοῦναι τῷ σπέρματι αὐτῶν καὶ καθέξουσιν αὐτὴν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
14 καὶ ἱλάσθη κύριος περὶ τῆς κακίας ἧς εἶπεν ποιῆσαι τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ

15 καὶ ἀποστρέψας Μωυσῆς κατέβη ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους καὶ αἱ δύο πλάκες τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ πλάκες λίθιναι καταγεγραμμέναι ἐξ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν μερῶν αὐτῶν ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν ἦσαν γεγραμμέναι
16 καὶ αἱ πλάκες ἔργον θεοῦ ἦσαν καὶ ἡ γραφὴ γραφὴ θεοῦ ἐστιν κεκολαμμένη ἐν ταῖς πλαξίν
17 καὶ ἀκούσας Ἰησοῦς τὴν φωνὴν τοῦ λαοῦ κραζόντων λέγει πρὸς Μωυσῆν φωνὴ πολέμου ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ
18 καὶ λέγει οὐκ ἔστιν φωνὴ ἐξαρχόντων κα{T'} ἰσχὺν οὐδὲ φωνὴ ἐξαρχόντων τροπῆς ἀλλὰ φωνὴν ἐξαρχόντων οἴνου ἐγὼ ἀκούω
19 καὶ ἡνίκα ἤγγιζεν τῇ παρεμβολῇ ὁρᾷ τὸν μόσχον καὶ τοὺς χορούς καὶ ὀργισθεὶς θυμῷ Μωυσῆς ἔρριψεν ἀπὸ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ τὰς δύο πλάκας καὶ συνέτριψεν αὐτὰς ὑπὸ τὸ ὄρος
20 καὶ λαβὼν τὸν μόσχον ὃν ἐποίησαν κατέκαυσεν αὐτὸν ἐν πυρὶ καὶ κατήλεσεν αὐτὸν λεπτὸν καὶ ἔσπειρεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ ἐπότισεν αὐτὸ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ
21 καὶ εἶπεν Μωυσῆς τῷ Ααρων τί ἐποίησέν σοι ὁ λαὸς οὗτος ὅτι ἐπήγαγες ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ἁμαρτίαν μεγάλην
22 καὶ εἶπεν Ααρων πρὸς Μωυσῆν μὴ ὀργίζου κύριε σὺ γὰρ οἶδας τὸ ὅρμημα τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου
23 λέγουσιν γάρ μοι ποίησον ἡμῖν θεούς οἳ προπορεύσονται ἡμῶν ὁ γὰρ Μωυσῆς οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἐξήγαγεν ἡμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου οὐκ οἴδαμεν τί γέγονεν αὐτῷ
24 καὶ εἶπα αὐτοῖς εἴ τινι ὑπάρχει χρυσία περιέλεσθε καὶ ἔδωκάν μοι καὶ ἔρριψα εἰς τὸ πῦρ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ μόσχος οὗτος

25 καὶ ἰδὼν Μωυσῆς τὸν λαὸν ὅτι διεσκέδασται διεσκέδασεν γὰρ αὐτοὺς Ααρων ἐπίχαρμα τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις αὐτῶν
26 ἔστη δὲ Μωυσῆς ἐπὶ τῆς πύλης τῆς παρεμβολῆς καὶ εἶπεν τίς πρὸς κύριον ἴτω πρός με συνῆλθον οὖν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Λευι
27 καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς τάδε λέγει κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ θέσθε ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ῥομφαίαν ἐπὶ τὸν μηρὸν καὶ διέλθατε καὶ ἀνακάμψατε ἀπὸ πύλης ἐπὶ πύλην διὰ τῆς παρεμβολῆς καὶ ἀποκτείνατε ἕκαστος τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕκαστος τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕκαστος τὸν ἔγγιστα αὐτοῦ
28 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Λευι καθὰ ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ εἰς τρισχιλίους ἄνδρας
29 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς ἐπληρώσατε τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν σήμερον κυρίῳ ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ υἱῷ ἢ τῷ ἀδελφῷ δοθῆναι ἐ{F'} ὑμᾶς εὐλογίαν

30 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὴν αὔριον εἶπεν Μωυσῆς πρὸς τὸν λαόν ὑμεῖς ἡμαρτήκατε ἁμαρτίαν μεγάλην καὶ νῦν ἀναβήσομαι πρὸς τὸν θεόν ἵνα ἐξιλάσωμαι περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν
31 ὑπέστρεψεν δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς κύριον καὶ εἶπεν δέομαι κύριε ἡμάρτηκεν ὁ λαὸς οὗτος ἁμαρτίαν μεγάλην καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς θεοὺς χρυσοῦς
32 καὶ νῦν εἰ μὲν ἀφεῖς αὐτοῖς τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ἄφες εἰ δὲ μή ἐξάλειψόν με ἐκ τῆς βίβλου σου ἧς ἔγραψας
33 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν εἴ τις ἡμάρτηκεν ἐνώπιόν μου ἐξαλείψω αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς βίβλου μου
34 νυνὶ δὲ βάδιζε κατάβηθι καὶ ὁδήγησον τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν εἶπά σοι ἰδοὺ ὁ ἄγγελός μου προπορεύεται πρὸ προσώπου σου ᾗ {D'} ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἐπισκέπτωμαι ἐπάξω ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς τὴν ἁμαρτίαν αὐτῶν

35 καὶ ἐπάταξεν κύριος τὸν λαὸν περὶ τῆς ποιήσεως τοῦ μόσχου οὗ ἐποίησεν Ααρων
