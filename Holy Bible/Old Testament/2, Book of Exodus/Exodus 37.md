# Book of Exodus 37 (RSVCE)

### Making the Ark of the Covenant
1 Bezʹalel made the ark of acacia wood; two cubits and a half was its length, a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.
2 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a molding of gold around it.
3 And he cast for it four rings of gold for its four corners, two rings on its one side and two rings on its other side.
4 And he made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold,
5 and put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark.
6 And he made a mercy seat of pure gold; two cubits and a half was its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth.
7 And he made two cherubim of hammered gold; on the two ends of the mercy seat he made them,
8 one cherub on the one end, and one cherub on the other end; of one piece with the mercy seat he made the cherubim on its two ends.
9 The cherubim spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy seat were the faces of the cherubim.
### Making the Table for the Bread of the Presence
10 He also made the table of acacia wood; two cubits was its length, a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;
11 and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a molding of gold around it.
12 And he made around it a frame a handbreadth wide, and made a molding of gold around the frame.
13 He cast for it four rings of gold, and fastened the rings to the four corners at its four legs.
14 Close to the frame were the rings, as holders for the poles to carry the table.
15 He made the poles of acacia wood to carry the table, and overlaid them with gold.
16 And he made the vessels of pure gold which were to be upon the table, its plates and dishes for incense, and its bowls and flagons with which to pour libations.
### Making the Lampstand
17 He also made the lampstand of pure gold. The base and the shaft of the lampstand were made of hammered work; its cups, its capitals, and its flowers were of one piece with it.
18 And there were six branches going out of its sides, three branches of the lampstand out of one side of it and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it;
19 three cups made like almonds, each with capital and flower, on one branch, and three cups made like almonds, each with capital and flower, on the other branch—so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.
20 And on the lampstand itself were four cups made like almonds, with their capitals and flowers,
21 and a capital of one piece with it under each pair of the six branches going out of it.
22 Their capitals and their branches were of one piece with it; the whole of it was one piece of hammered work of pure gold.
23 And he made its seven lamps and its snuffers and its trays of pure gold.
24 He made it and all its utensils of a talent of pure gold.
### Making the Altar of Incense
25 He made the altar of incense of acacia wood; its length was a cubit, and its breadth was a cubit; it was square, and two cubits was its height; its horns were of one piece with it.
26 He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and he made a molding of gold round about it,
27 and made two rings of gold on it under its molding, on two opposite sides of it, as holders for the poles with which to carry it.
28 And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.
### Making the Anointing Oil and the Incense
29 He made the holy anointing oil also, and the pure fragrant incense, blended as by the perfumer.


# Liber Exodus 37 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Fecit autem Beseleel et arcam de lignis setim, habentem duos semis cubitos in longitudine, et cubitum ac semissem in latitudine, altitudo quoque unius cubiti fuit et dimidii: vestivitque eam auro purissimo intus ac foris.
2 Et fecit illi coronam auream per gyrum,
3 conflans quatuor annulos aureos per quatuor angulos ejus: duos annulos in latere uno, et duos in altero.
4 Vectes quoque fecit de lignis setim, quos vestivit auro,
5 et quos misit in annulos, qui erant in lateribus arcæ ad portandum eam.

6 Fecit et propitiatorium, id est, oraculum, de auro mundissimo, duorum cubitorum et dimidii in longitudine, et cubiti ac semis in latitudine.
7 Duos etiam cherubim ex auro ductili, quos posuit ex utraque parte propitiatorii:
8 cherub unum in summitate unius partis, et cherub alterum in summitate partis alterius: duos cherubim in singulis summitatibus propitiatorii,
9 extendentes alas, et tegentes propitiatorium, seque mutuo et illud respicientes.

10 Fecit et mensam de lignis setim in longitudine duorum cubitorum, et in latitudine unius cubiti, quæ habebat in altitudine cubitum ac semissem.
11 Circumdeditque eam auro mundissimo, et fecit illi labium aureum per gyrum,
12 ipsique labio coronam auream interrasilem quatuor digitorum, et super eamdem, alteram coronam auream.
13 Fudit et quatuor circulos aureos, quos posuit in quatuor angulis per singulos pedes mensæ
14 contra coronam: misitque in eos vectes, ut possit mensa portari.
15 Ipsos quoque vectes fecit de lignis setim, et circumdedit eos auro.
16 Et vasa ad diversos usus mensæ, acetabula, phialas, et cyathos, et thuribula, ex auro puro, in quibus offerenda sunt libamina.

17 Fecit et candelabrum ductile de auro mundissimo, de cujus vecte calami, scyphi, sphærulæque, ac lilia procedebant:
18 sex in utroque latere, tres calami ex parte una, et tres ex altera:
19 tres scyphi in nucis modum per calamos singulos, sphærulæque simul et lilia: et tres scyphi instar nucis in calamo altero, sphærulæque simul et lilia. Æquum erat opus sex calamorum, qui procedebant de stipite candelabri.
20 In ipso autem vecte erant quatuor scyphi in nucis modum, sphærulæque per singulos simul et lilia:
21 et sphærulæ sub duobus calamis per loca tria, qui simul sex fiunt calami procedentes de vecte uno.
22 Et sphærulæ igitur, et calami ex ipso erant, universa ductilia ex auro purissimo.
23 Fecit et lucernas septem cum emunctoriis suis, et vasa ubi ea, quæ emuncta sunt, extinguantur, de auro mundissimo.
24 Talentum auri appendebat candelabrum cum omnibus vasis suis.

25 Fecit et altare thymiamatis de lignis setim, per quadrum singulos habens cubitos, et in altitudine duos: e cujus angulis procedebant cornua.
26 Vestivitque illud auro purissimo cum craticula ac parietibus et cornibus.
27 Fecitque ei coronam aureolam per gyrum, et duos annulos aureos sub corona per singula latera, ut mittantur in eos vectes, et possit altare portari.
28 Ipsos autem vectes fecit de lignis setim, et operuit laminis aureis.

29 Composuit et oleum ad sanctificationis unguentum, et thymiama de aromatibus mundissimis opere pigmentarii.
