# Book of Exodus 18 (RSVCE)

### Jethro’s Advice
1 Jethro, the priest of Midʹian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how theLordhad brought Israel out of Egypt.
2 Now Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, had taken Zippoʹrah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,
3 and her two sons, of whom the name of the one was Gershom (for he said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign land”),
4 and the name of the other, Elieʹzer (for he said, “The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”).
5 And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God.
6 And when one told Moses, “Lo, your father-in-law Jethro is coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her,”
7 Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare, and went into the tent.
8 Then Moses told his father-in-law all that theLordhad done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how theLordhad delivered them.
9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the good which theLordhad done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
10 And Jethro said, “Blessed be theLord, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh.
11 Now I know that theLordis greater than all gods, because he delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians, when they dealt arrogantly with them.”
12 And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, offered a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
13 On the morrow Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Moses from morning till evening.
14 When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand about you from morning till evening?”
15 And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God;
16 when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God and his decisions.”
17 Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good.
18 You and the people with you will wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it alone.
19 Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God, and bring their cases to God;
20 and you shall teach them the statutes and the decisions, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.
21 Moreover choose able men from all the people, such as fear God, men who are trustworthy and who hate a bribe; and place such men over the people as rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
22 And let them judge the people at all times; every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves; so it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.
23 If you do this, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace.”
24 So Moses gave heed to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
25 Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
26 And they judged the people at all times; hard cases they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves.
27 Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way to his own country.


# Liber Exodus 18 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Cumque audisset Jethro, sacerdos Madian, cognatus Moysi, omnia quæ fecerat Deus Moysi, et Israëli populo suo, et quod eduxisset Dominus Israël de Ægypto,
2 tulit Sephoram uxorem Moysi quam remiserat,
3 et duos filios ejus: quorum unus vocabatur Gersam, dicente patre: Advena fui in terra aliena;
4 alter vero Eliezer: Deus enim, ait, patris mei adjutor meus, et eruit me de gladio Pharaonis.
5 Venit ergo Jethro cognatus Moysi, et filii ejus, et uxor ejus ad Moysen in desertum, ubi erat castrametatus juxta montem Dei.
6 Et mandavit Moysi, dicens: Ego Jethro cognatus tuus venio ad te, et uxor tua, et duo filii cum ea.
7 Qui egressus in occursum cognati sui, adoravit, et osculatus est eum: salutaveruntque se mutuo verbis pacificis. Cumque intrasset tabernaculum,
8 narravit Moyses cognato suo cuncta quæ fecerat Dominus Pharaoni et Ægyptiis propter Israël: universumque laborem, qui accidisset eis in itinere, et quod liberaverat eos Dominus.
9 Lætatusque est Jethro super omnibus bonis, quæ fecerat Dominus Israëli, eo quod eruisset eum de manu Ægyptiorum.
10 Et ait: Benedictus Dominus, qui liberavit vos de manu Ægyptiorum, et de manu Pharaonis; qui eruit populum suum de manu Ægypti.
11 Nunc cognovi, quia magnus Dominus super omnes deos: eo quod superbe egerint contra illos.
12 Obtulit ergo Jethro cognatus Moysi holocausta et hostias Deo: veneruntque Aaron et omnes seniores Israël, ut comederent panem cum eo coram Deo.

13 Altera autem die sedit Moyses ut judicaret populum, qui assistebat Moysi a mane usque ad vesperam.
14 Quod cum vidisset cognatus ejus, omnia scilicet quæ agebat in populo, ait: Quid est hoc quod facis in plebe? cur solus sedes, et omnis populus præstolatur de mane usque ad vesperam?
15 Cui respondit Moyses: Venit ad me populus quærens sententiam Dei:
16 cumque acciderit eis aliqua disceptatio, veniunt ad me ut judicem inter eos, et ostendam præcepta Dei, et leges ejus.
17 At ille: Non bonam, inquit, rem facis.
18 Stulto labore consumeris et tu, et populus iste qui tecum est: ultra vires tuas est negotium; solus illud non poteris sustinere.
19 Sed audi verba mea atque consilia, et erit Deus tecum. Esto tu populo in his quæ ad Deum pertinent, ut referas quæ dicuntur ad eum:
20 ostendasque populo cæremonias et ritum colendi, viamque per quam ingredi debeant, et opus quod facere debeant.
21 Provide autem de omni plebe viros potentes, et timentes Deum, in quibus sit veritas, et qui oderint avaritiam, et constitue ex eis tribunos, et centuriones, et quinquagenarios, et decanos,
22 qui judicent populum omni tempore: quidquid autem majus fuerit, referant ad te, et ipsi minora tantummodo judicent: leviusque sit tibi, partito in alios onere.
23 Si hoc feceris, implebis imperium Dei, et præcepta ejus poteris sustentare: et omnis hic populus revertetur ad loca sua cum pace.

24 Quibus auditis, Moyses fecit omnia quæ ille suggesserat.
25 Et electis viris strenuis de cuncto Israël, constituit eos principes populi, tribunos, et centuriones, et quinquagenarios, et decanos.
26 Qui judicabant plebem omni tempore: quidquid autem gravius erat, referebant ad eum, faciliora tantummodo judicantes.
27 Dimisitque cognatum suum: qui reversus abiit in terram suam.

1 ἤκουσεν δὲ Ιοθορ ὁ ἱερεὺς Μαδιαμ ὁ γαμβρὸς Μωυσῆ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν κύριος Ισραηλ τῷ ἑαυτοῦ λαῷ ἐξήγαγεν γὰρ κύριος τὸν Ισραηλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου

3 καὶ τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ ὄνομα τῷ ἑνὶ αὐτῶν Γηρσαμ λέγων πάροικος ἤμην ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ
4 καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ δευτέρου Ελιεζερ λέγων ὁ γὰρ θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου βοηθός μου καὶ ἐξείλατό με ἐκ χειρὸς Φαραω
5 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ιοθορ ὁ γαμβρὸς Μωυσῆ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς Μωυσῆν εἰς τὴν ἔρημον οὗ παρενέβαλεν ἐ{P'} ὄρους τοῦ θεοῦ
6 ἀνηγγέλη δὲ Μωυσεῖ λέγοντες ἰδοὺ ὁ γαμβρός σου Ιοθορ παραγίνεται πρὸς σέ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ καὶ οἱ δύο υἱοί σου με{T'} αὐτοῦ
7 ἐξῆλθεν δὲ Μωυσῆς εἰς συνάντησιν τῷ γαμβρῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐφίλησεν αὐτόν καὶ ἠσπάσαντο ἀλλήλους καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν σκηνήν
8 καὶ διηγήσατο Μωυσῆς τῷ γαμβρῷ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν κύριος τῷ Φαραω καὶ τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις ἕνεκεν τοῦ Ισραηλ καὶ πάντα τὸν μόχθον τὸν γενόμενον αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ὅτι ἐξείλατο αὐτοὺς κύριος ἐκ χειρὸς Φαραω καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν Αἰγυπτίων
9 ἐξέστη δὲ Ιοθορ ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς οἷς ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς κύριος ὅτι ἐξείλατο αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς Αἰγυπτίων καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς Φαραω
10 καὶ εἶπεν Ιοθορ εὐλογητὸς κύριος ὅτι ἐξείλατο τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐκ χειρὸς Αἰγυπτίων καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς Φαραω
11 νῦν ἔγνων ὅτι μέγας κύριος παρὰ πάντας τοὺς θεούς ἕνεκεν τούτου ὅτι ἐπέθεντο αὐτοῖς
12 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ιοθορ ὁ γαμβρὸς Μωυσῆ ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ θυσίας τῷ θεῷ παρεγένετο δὲ Ααρων καὶ πάντες οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ισραηλ συμφαγεῖν ἄρτον μετὰ τοῦ γαμβροῦ Μωυσῆ ἐναντίον τοῦ θεοῦ

13 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὴν ἐπαύριον συνεκάθισεν Μωυσῆς κρίνειν τὸν λαόν παρειστήκει δὲ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς Μωυσεῖ ἀπὸ πρωίθεν ἕως ἑσπέρας
14 καὶ ἰδὼν Ιοθορ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίει τῷ λαῷ λέγει τί τοῦτο ὃ σὺ ποιεῖς τῷ λαῷ διὰ τί σὺ κάθησαι μόνος πᾶς δὲ ὁ λαὸς παρέστηκέν σοι ἀπὸ πρωίθεν ἕως δείλης
15 καὶ λέγει Μωυσῆς τῷ γαμβρῷ ὅτι παραγίνεται πρός με ὁ λαὸς ἐκζητῆσαι κρίσιν παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ
16 ὅταν γὰρ γένηται αὐτοῖς ἀντιλογία καὶ ἔλθωσι πρός με διακρίνω ἕκαστον καὶ συμβιβάζω αὐτοὺς τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὸν νόμον αὐτοῦ
17 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ γαμβρὸς Μωυσῆ πρὸς αὐτόν οὐκ ὀρθῶς σὺ ποιεῖς τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο
18 φθορᾷ καταφθαρήσῃ ἀνυπομονήτῳ καὶ σὺ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς οὗτος ὅς ἐστιν μετὰ σοῦ βαρύ σοι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο οὐ δυνήσῃ ποιεῖν μόνος
19 νῦν οὖν ἄκουσόν μου καὶ συμβουλεύσω σοι καὶ ἔσται ὁ θεὸς μετὰ σοῦ γίνου σὺ τῷ λαῷ τὰ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν καὶ ἀνοίσεις τοὺς λόγους αὐτῶν πρὸς τὸν θεὸν
20 καὶ διαμαρτυρῇ αὐτοῖς τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὸν νόμον αὐτοῦ καὶ σημανεῖς αὐτοῖς τὰς ὁδούς ἐν αἷς πορεύσονται ἐν αὐταῖς καὶ τὰ ἔργα ἃ ποιήσουσιν
21 καὶ σὺ σεαυτῷ σκέψαι ἀπὸ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ ἄνδρας δυνατοὺς θεοσεβεῖς ἄνδρας δικαίους μισοῦντας ὑπερηφανίαν καὶ καταστήσεις αὐτοὺς ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν χιλιάρχους καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους καὶ πεντηκοντάρχους καὶ δεκαδάρχους
22 καὶ κρινοῦσιν τὸν λαὸν πᾶσαν ὥραν τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα τὸ ὑπέρογκον ἀνοίσουσιν ἐπὶ σέ τὰ δὲ βραχέα τῶν κριμάτων κρινοῦσιν αὐτοὶ καὶ κουφιοῦσιν ἀπὸ σοῦ καὶ συναντιλήμψονταί σοι
23 ἐὰν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ποιήσῃς κατισχύσει σε ὁ θεός καὶ δυνήσῃ παραστῆναι καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς οὗτος εἰς τὸν ἑαυτοῦ τόπον με{T'} εἰρήνης ἥξει

24 ἤκουσεν δὲ Μωυσῆς τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ γαμβροῦ καὶ ἐποίησεν ὅσα αὐτῷ εἶπεν
25 καὶ ἐπέλεξεν Μωυσῆς ἄνδρας δυνατοὺς ἀπὸ παντὸς Ισραηλ καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοὺς ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν χιλιάρχους καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους καὶ πεντηκοντάρχους καὶ δεκαδάρχους
26 καὶ ἐκρίνοσαν τὸν λαὸν πᾶσαν ὥραν πᾶν δὲ ῥῆμα ὑπέρογκον ἀνεφέροσαν ἐπὶ Μωυσῆν πᾶν δὲ ῥῆμα ἐλαφρὸν ἐκρίνοσαν αὐτοί
27 ἐξαπέστειλεν δὲ Μωυσῆς τὸν ἑαυτοῦ γαμβρόν καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ
