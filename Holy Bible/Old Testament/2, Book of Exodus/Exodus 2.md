# Book of Exodus 2 (RSVCE)

### Birth and Youth of Moses
1 Now a man from the house of Levi went and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
2 The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
3 And when she could hide him no longer she took for him a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with bitumen and pitch; and she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds at the river’s brink.
4 And his sister stood at a distance, to know what would be done to him.
5 Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked beside the river; she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid to fetch it.
6 When she opened it she saw the child; and lo, the babe was crying. She took pity on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”
7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?”
8 And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” So the girl went and called the child’s mother.
9 And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.
10 And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son; and she named him Moses, for she said, “Because I drew him out of the water.”
### Moses Flees to Midian
11 One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.
12 He looked this way and that, and seeing no one he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
13 When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together; and he said to the man that did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?”
14 He answered, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid, and thought, “Surely the thing is known.”
15 When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh, and stayed in the land of Midʹian; and he sat down by a well.
16 Now the priest of Midʹian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
17 The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
18 When they came to their father Reuʹel, he said, “How is it that you have come so soon today?”
19 They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and even drew water for us and watered the flock.”
20 He said to his daughters, “And where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”
21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daugher Zippoʹrah.
22 She bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.”
23 In the course of those many days the king of Egypt died. And the people of Israel groaned under their bondage, and cried out for help, and their cry under bondage came up to God.
24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
25 And God saw the people of Israel, and God knew their condition.


# Liber Exodus 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Egressus est post hæc vir de domo Levi: et accepit uxorem stirpis suæ.
2 Quæ concepit, et peperit filium: et videns eum elegantem, abscondit tribus mensibus.
3 Cumque jam celare non posset, sumpsit fiscellam scirpeam, et linivit eam bitumine ac pice: posuitque intus infantulum, et exposuit eum in carecto ripæ fluminis,
4 stante procul sorore ejus, et considerante eventum rei.
5 Ecce autem descendebat filia Pharaonis ut lavaretur in flumine: et puellæ ejus gradiebantur per crepidinem alvei. Quæ cum vidisset fiscellam in papyrione, misit unam e famulabus suis: et allatam
6 aperiens, cernensque in ea parvulum vagientem, miserta ejus, ait: De infantibus Hebræorum est hic.
7 Cui soror pueri: Vis, inquit, ut vadam, et vocem tibi mulierem hebræam, quæ nutrire possit infantulum?
8 Respondit: Vade. Perrexit puella et vocavit matrem suam.
9 Ad quam locuta filia Pharaonis: Accipe, ait, puerum istum, et nutri mihi: ego dabo tibi mercedem tuam. Suscepit mulier, et nutrivit puerum: adultumque tradidit filiæ Pharaonis.
10 Quem illa adoptavit in locum filii, vocavitque nomen ejus Moyses, dicens: Quia de aqua tuli eum.

11 In diebus illis postquam creverat Moyses, egressus est ad fratres suos: viditque afflictionem eorum, et virum ægyptium percutientem quemdam de Hebræis fratribus suis.
12 Cumque circumspexisset huc atque illuc, et nullum adesse vidisset, percussum Ægyptium abscondit sabulo.
13 Et egressus die altero conspexit duos Hebræos rixantes: dixitque ei qui faciebat injuriam: Quare percutis proximum tuum?
14 Qui respondit: Quis te constituit principem et judicem super nos? num occidere me tu vis, sicut heri occidisti Ægyptium? Timuit Moyses, et ait: Quomodo palam factum est verbum istud?
15 Audivitque Pharao sermonem hunc, et quærebat occidere Moysen: qui fugiens de conspectu ejus, moratus est in terra Madian, et sedit juxta puteum.
16 Erant autem sacerdoti Madian septem filiæ, quæ venerunt ad hauriendam aquam: et impletis canalibus adaquare cupiebant greges patris sui.
17 Supervenere pastores, et ejecerunt eas: surrexitque Moyses, et defensis puellis, adaquavit oves earum.
18 Quæ cum revertissent ad Raguel patrem suum, dixit ad eas: Cur velocius venistis solito?
19 Responderunt: Vir ægyptius liberavit nos de manu pastorum: insuper et hausit aquam nobiscum, potumque dedit ovibus.
20 At ille: Ubi est? inquit: quare dimisistis hominem? vocate eum ut comedat panem.

21 Juravit ergo Moyses quod habitaret cum eo. Accepitque Sephoram filiam ejus uxorem:
22 quæ peperit ei filium, quem vocavit Gersam, dicens: Advena fui in terra aliena. Alterum vero peperit, quem vocavit Eliezer, dicens: Deus enim patris mei adjutor meus eripuit me de manu Pharaonis.

23 Post multum vero tempore mortuus est rex Ægypti: et ingemiscentes filii Israël, propter opera vociferati sunt: ascenditque clamor eorum ad Deum ab operibus.
24 Et audivit gemitum eorum, ac recordatus est fœderis quod pepigit cum Abraham, Isaac et Jacob.
25 Et respexit Dominus filios Israël et cognovit eos.

1 ἦν δέ τις ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Λευι ὃς ἔλαβεν τῶν θυγατέρων Λευι καὶ ἔσχεν αὐτήν
2 καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔλαβεν καὶ ἔτεκεν ἄρσεν ἰδόντες δὲ αὐτὸ ἀστεῖον ἐσκέπασαν αὐτὸ μῆνας τρεῖς
3 ἐπεὶ δὲ οὐκ ἠδύναντο αὐτὸ ἔτι κρύπτειν ἔλαβεν αὐτῷ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ θῖβιν καὶ κατέχρισεν αὐτὴν ἀσφαλτοπίσσῃ καὶ ἐνέβαλεν τὸ παιδίον εἰς αὐτὴν καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὸ ἕλος παρὰ τὸν ποταμόν
4 καὶ κατεσκόπευεν ἡ ἀδελφὴ αὐτοῦ μακρόθεν μαθεῖν τί τὸ ἀποβησόμενον αὐτῷ
5 κατέβη δὲ ἡ θυγάτηρ Φαραω λούσασθαι ἐπὶ τὸν ποταμόν καὶ αἱ ἅβραι αὐτῆς παρεπορεύοντο παρὰ τὸν ποταμόν καὶ ἰδοῦσα τὴν θῖβιν ἐν τῷ ἕλει ἀποστείλασα τὴν ἅβραν ἀνείλατο αὐτήν
6 ἀνοίξασα δὲ ὁρᾷ παιδίον κλαῖον ἐν τῇ θίβει καὶ ἐφείσατο αὐτοῦ ἡ θυγάτηρ Φαραω καὶ ἔφη ἀπὸ τῶν παιδίων τῶν Εβραίων τοῦτο
7 καὶ εἶπεν ἡ ἀδελφὴ αὐτοῦ τῇ θυγατρὶ Φαραω θέλεις καλέσω σοι γυναῖκα τροφεύουσαν ἐκ τῶν Εβραίων καὶ θηλάσει σοι τὸ παιδίον
8 ἡ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ἡ θυγάτηρ Φαραω πορεύου ἐλθοῦσα δὲ ἡ νεᾶνις ἐκάλεσεν τὴν μητέρα τοῦ παιδίου
9 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὴν ἡ θυγάτηρ Φαραω διατήρησόν μοι τὸ παιδίον τοῦτο καὶ θήλασόν μοι αὐτό ἐγὼ δὲ δώσω σοι τὸν μισθόν ἔλαβεν δὲ ἡ γυνὴ τὸ παιδίον καὶ ἐθήλαζεν αὐτό
10 ἁδρυνθέντος δὲ τοῦ παιδίου εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸ πρὸς τὴν θυγατέρα Φαραω καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῇ εἰς υἱόν ἐπωνόμασεν δὲ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Μωυσῆν λέγουσα ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος αὐτὸν ἀνειλόμην

11 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταῖς πολλαῖς ἐκείναις μέγας γενόμενος Μωυσῆς ἐξήλθεν πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ κατανοήσας δὲ τὸν πόνον αὐτῶν ὁρᾷ ἄνθρωπον Αἰγύπτιον τύπτοντά τινα Εβραῖον τῶν ἑαυτοῦ ἀδελφῶν τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ
12 περιβλεψάμενος δὲ ὧδε καὶ ὧδε οὐχ ὁρᾷ οὐδένα καὶ πατάξας τὸν Αἰγύπτιον ἔκρυψεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἄμμῳ
13 ἐξελθὼν δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ ὁρᾷ δύο ἄνδρας Εβραίους διαπληκτιζομένους καὶ λέγει τῷ ἀδικοῦντι διὰ τί σὺ τύπτεις τὸν πλησίον
14 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν ἐ{F'} ἡμῶν μὴ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες ἐχθὲς τὸν Αἰγύπτιον ἐφοβήθη δὲ Μωυσῆς καὶ εἶπεν εἰ οὕτως ἐμφανὲς γέγονεν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο
15 ἤκουσεν δὲ Φαραω τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο καὶ ἐζήτει ἀνελεῖν Μωυσῆν ἀνεχώρησεν δὲ Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ προσώπου Φαραω καὶ ᾤκησεν ἐν γῇ Μαδιαμ ἐλθὼν δὲ εἰς γῆν Μαδιαμ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τοῦ φρέατος
16 τῷ δὲ ἱερεῖ Μαδιαμ ἦσαν ἑπτὰ θυγατέρες ποιμαίνουσαι τὰ πρόβατα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν Ιοθορ παραγενόμεναι δὲ ἤντλουν ἕως ἔπλησαν τὰς δεξαμενὰς ποτίσαι τὰ πρόβατα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν Ιοθορ
17 παραγενόμενοι δὲ οἱ ποιμένες ἐξέβαλον αὐτάς ἀναστὰς δὲ Μωυσῆς ἐρρύσατο αὐτὰς καὶ ἤντλησεν αὐταῖς καὶ ἐπότισεν τὰ πρόβατα αὐτῶν
18 παρεγένοντο δὲ πρὸς Ραγουηλ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐταῖς τί ὅτι ἐταχύνατε τοῦ παραγενέσθαι σήμερον
19 αἱ δὲ εἶπαν ἄνθρωπος Αἰγύπτιος ἐρρύσατο ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τῶν ποιμένων καὶ ἤντλησεν ἡμῖν καὶ ἐπότισεν τὰ πρόβατα ἡμῶν
20 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ταῖς θυγατράσιν αὐτοῦ καὶ ποῦ ἐστι καὶ ἵνα τί οὕτως καταλελοίπατε τὸν ἄνθρωπον καλέσατε οὖν αὐτόν ὅπως φάγῃ ἄρτον

21 κατῳκίσθη δὲ Μωυσῆς παρὰ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ καὶ ἐξέδοτο Σεπφωραν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ Μωυσῇ γυναῖκα
22 ἐν γαστρὶ δὲ λαβοῦσα ἡ γυνὴ ἔτεκεν υἱόν καὶ ἐπωνόμασεν Μωυσῆς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Γηρσαμ λέγων ὅτι πάροικός εἰμι ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ

23 μετὰ δὲ τὰς ἡμέρας τὰς πολλὰς ἐκείνας ἐτελεύτησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου καὶ κατεστέναξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων καὶ ἀνεβόησαν καὶ ἀνέβη ἡ βοὴ αὐτῶν πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων
24 καὶ εἰσήκουσεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν στεναγμὸν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐμνήσθη ὁ θεὸς τῆς διαθήκης αὐτοῦ τῆς πρὸς Αβρααμ καὶ Ισαακ καὶ Ιακωβ
25 καὶ ἐπεῖδεν ὁ θεὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ καὶ ἐγνώσθη αὐτοῖς
