# Book of Exodus 29 (RSVCE)

### The Ordination of the Priests
1 “Now this is what you shall do to them to consecrate them, that they may serve me as priests. Take one young bull and two rams without blemish,
2 and unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil. You shall make them of fine wheat flour.
3 And you shall put them in one basket and bring them in the basket, and bring the bull and the two rams.
4 You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water.
5 And you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastpiece, and gird him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod;
6 and you shall set the turban on his head, and put the holy crown upon the turban.
7 And you shall take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head and anoint him.
8 Then you shall bring his sons, and put coats on them,
9 and you shall gird them with girdles and bind caps on them; and the priesthood shall be theirs by a perpetual statute. Thus you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.
10 “Then you shall bring the bull before the tent of meeting. Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bull,
11 and you shall kill the bull before theLord, at the door of the tent of meeting,
12 and shall take part of the blood of the bull and put it upon the horns of the altar with your finger, and the rest of the blood you shall pour out at the base of the altar.
13 And you shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and burn them upon the altar.
14 But the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering.
15 “Then you shall take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram,
16 and you shall slaughter the ram, and shall take its blood and throw it against the altar round about.
17 Then you shall cut the ram into pieces, and wash its entrails and its legs, and put them with its pieces and its head,
18 and burn the whole ram upon the altar; it is a burnt offering to theLord; it is a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to theLord.
19 “You shall take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram,
20 and you shall kill the ram, and take part of its blood and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron and upon the tips of the right ears of his sons, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet, and throw the rest of the blood against the altar round about.
21 Then you shall take part of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron and his garments, and upon his sons and his sons’ garments with him; and he and his garments shall be holy, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.
22 “You shall also take the fat of the ram, and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the entrails, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of ordination),
23 and one loaf of bread, and one cake of bread with oil, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before theLord;
24 and you shall put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and wave them for a wave offering before theLord.
25 Then you shall take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar in addition to the burnt offering, as a pleasing odor before theLord; it is an offering by fire to theLord.
26 “And you shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s ordination and wave if for a wave offering before theLord; and it shall be your portion.
27 And you shall consecrate the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh of the priests’ portion, which is waved, and which is offered from the ram of ordination, since it is for Aaron and for his sons.
28 It shall be for Aaron and his sons as a perpetual due from the people of Israel, for it is the priests’ portion to be offered by the people of Israel from their peace offerings; it is their offering to theLord.
29 “The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them and ordained in them.
30 The son who is priest in his place shall wear them seven days, when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.
31 “You shall take the ram of ordination, and boil its flesh in a holy place;
32 and Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting.
33 They shall eat those things with which atonement was made, to ordain and consecrate them, but an outsider shall not eat of them, because they are holy.
34 And if any of the flesh for the ordination, or of the bread, remain until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
35 “Thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you; through seven days shall you ordain them,
36 and every day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement. Also you shall offer a sin offering for the altar, when you make atonement for it, and shall anoint it, to consecrate it.
37 Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar, and consecrate it, and the altar shall be most holy; whatever touches the altar shall become holy.
### The Daily Offerings
38 “Now this is what you shall offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.
39 One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer in the evening;
40 and with the first lamb a tenth measure of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a libation.
41 And the other lamb you shall offer in the evening, and shall offer with it a cereal offering and its libation, as in the morning, for a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to theLord.
42 It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before theLord, where I will meet with you, to speak there to you.
43 There I will meet with the people of Israel, and it shall be sanctified by my glory;
44 I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar; Aaron also and his sons I will consecrate, to serve me as priest.
45 And I will dwell among the people of Israel, and will be their God.
46 And they shall know that I am theLordtheir God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt that I might dwell among them; I am theLordtheir God.


# Liber Exodus 29 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Sed et hoc facies, ut mihi in sacerdotio consecrentur. Tolle vitulum de armento, et arietes duos immaculatos,
2 panesque azymos, et crustulam absque fermento, quæ conspersa sit oleo, lagana quoque azyma oleo lita: de simila triticea cuncta facies.
3 Et posita in canistro offeres: vitulum autem et duos arietes.
4 Et Aaron ac filios ejus applicabis ad ostium tabernaculi testimonii. Cumque laveris patrem cum filiis suis aqua,
5 indues Aaron vestimentis suis, id est, linea et tunica, et superhumerali et rationali, quod constringes balteo.
6 Et pones tiaram in capite ejus, et laminam sanctam super tiaram,
7 et oleum unctionis fundes super caput ejus: atque hoc ritu consecrabitur.
8 Filios quoque illius applicabis, et indues tunicis lineis, cingesque balteo,
9 Aaron scilicet et liberos ejus, et impones eis mitras: eruntque sacerdotes mihi religione perpetua. Postquam initiaveris manus eorum,
10 applicabis et vitulum coram tabernaculo testimonii. Imponentque Aaron et filii ejus manus super caput illius,
11 et mactabis eum in conspectu Domini, juxta ostium tabernaculi testimonii.
12 Sumptumque de sanguine vituli, pones super cornua altaris digito tuo, reliquum autem sanguinem fundes juxta basim ejus.
13 Sumes et adipem totum qui operit intestina, et reticulum jecoris, ac duos renes, et adipem qui super eos est, et offeres incensum super altare:
14 carnes vero vituli et corium et fimum combures foris extra castra, eo quod pro peccato sit.

15 Unum quoque arietem sumes, super cujus caput ponent Aaron et filii ejus manus.
16 Quem cum mactaveris, tolles de sanguine ejus, et fundes circa altare.
17 Ipsum autem arietem secabis in frustra: lotaque intestina ejus ac pedes, pones super concisas carnes, et super caput illius.
18 Et offeres totum arietem in incensum super altare: oblatio est Domino, odor suavissimus victimæ Domini.
19 Tolles quoque arietem alterum, super cujus caput Aaron et filii ejus ponent manus.
20 Quem cum immolaveris, sumes de sanguine ejus, et pones super extremum auriculæ dextræ Aaron et filiorum ejus, et super pollices manus eorum ac pedis dextri, fundesque sanguinem super altare per circuitum.
21 Cumque tuleris de sanguine qui est super altare, et de oleo unctionis, asperges Aaron et vestes ejus, filios et vestimenta eorum. Consecratisque ipsis et vestibus,

22 tolles adipem de ariete, et caudam et arvinam, quæ operit vitalia, ac reticulum jecoris, et duos renes, atque adipem, qui super eos est, armumque dextrum, eo quod sit aries consecrationis:
23 tortamque panis unius, crustulam conspersam oleo, laganum de canistro azymorum, quod positum est in conspectu Domini:
24 ponesque omnia super manus Aaron et filiorum ejus, et sanctificabis eos elevans coram Domino.
25 Suscipiesque universa de manibus eorum: et incendes super altare in holocaustum, odorem suavissimum in conspectu Domini, quia oblatio ejus est.
26 Sumes quoque pectusculum de ariete, quo initiatus est Aaron, sanctificabisque illud elevatum coram Domino, et cedet in partem tuam.

27 Sanctificabisque et pectusculum consecratum, et armum quem de ariete separasti,
28 quo initiatus est Aaron et filii ejus, cedentque in partem Aaron et filiorum ejus jure perpetuo a filiis Israël: quia primitiva sunt et initia de victimis eorum pacificis quæ offerunt Domino.
29 Vestem autem sanctam, qua utetur Aaron, habebunt filii ejus post eum, ut ungantur in ea, et consecrantur manus eorum.
30 Septem diebus utetur illa qui pontifex pro eo fuerit constitutus de filiis ejus, et qui ingredietur tabernaculum testimonii ut ministret in sanctuario.
31 Arietem autem consecrationis tolles, et coques carnes ejus in loco sancto:
32 quibus vescetur Aaron et filii ejus. Panes quoque, qui sunt in canistro, in vestibulo tabernaculi testimonii comedent,
33 ut sit placabile sacrificium, et sanctificentur offerentium manus. Alienigena non vescetur ex eis, quia sancti sunt.
34 Quod si remanserit de carnibus consecratis, sive de panibus usque mane, combures reliquias igni: non comedentur, quia sanctificata sunt.
35 Omnia, quæ præcepi tibi, facies super Aaron et filiis ejus. Septem diebus consecrabis manus eorum:
36 et vitulum pro peccato offeres per singulos dies ad expiandum. Mundabisque altare cum immolaveris expiationis hostiam, et unges illud in sanctificationem.
37 Septem diebus expiabis altare, et sanctificabis, et erit Sanctum sanctorum: omnis, qui tetigerit illud, sanctificabitur.

38 Hoc est quod facies in altari: agnos anniculos duos per singulos dies jugiter,
39 unum agnum mane, et alterum vespere,
40 decimam partem similæ conspersæ oleo tuso, quod habeat mensuram quartam partem hin, et vinum ad libandum ejusdem mensuræ in agno uno.
41 Alterum vero agnum offeres ad vesperam juxta ritum matutinæ oblationis, et juxta ea quæ diximus, in odorem suavitatis:
42 sacrificium est Domino, oblatione perpetua in generationes vestras, ad ostium tabernaculi testimonii coram Domino, ubi constituam ut loquar ad te.
43 Ibique præcipiam filiis Israël, et sanctificabitur altare in gloria mea.
44 Sanctificabo et tabernaculum testimonii cum altari, et Aaron cum filiis suis, ut sacerdotio fungantur mihi.
45 Et habitabo in medio filiorum Israël, eroque eis Deus,
46 et scient quia ego Dominus Deus eorum, qui eduxi eos de terra Ægypti, ut manerem inter illos, ego Dominus Deus ipsorum.
