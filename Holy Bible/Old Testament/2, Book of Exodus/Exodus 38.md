# Book of Exodus 38 (RSVCE)

### Making the Altar of Burnt Offering
1 He made the altar of burnt offering also of acacia wood; five cubits was its length, and five cubits its breadth; it was square, and three cubits was its height.
2 He made horns for it on its four corners; its horns were of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze.
3 And he made all the utensils of the altar, the pots, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and the firepans; all its utensils he made of bronze.
4 And he made for the altar a grating, a network of bronze, under its ledge, extending halfway down.
5 He cast four rings on the four corners of the bronze grating as holders for the poles;
6 he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with bronze.
7 And he put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar, to carry it with them; he made it hollow, with boards.
8 And he made the laver of bronze and its base of bronze, from the mirrors of the ministering women who ministered at the door of the tent of meeting.
### Making the Court of the Tabernacle
9 And he made the court; for the south side the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits;
10 their pillars were twenty and their bases twenty, of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.
11 And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, their bases twenty, of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.
12 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.
13 And for the front to the east, fifty cubits.
14 The hangings for one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, with three pillars and three bases.
15 And so for the other side; on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits, with three pillars and three bases.
16 All the hangings round about the court were of fine twined linen.
17 And the bases for the pillars were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver; the overlaying of their capitals was also of silver, and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.
18 And the screen for the gate of the court was embroidered with needlework in blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen; it was twenty cubits long and five cubits high in its breadth, corresponding to the hangings of the court.
19 And their pillars were four; their four bases were of bronze, their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets of silver.
20 And all the pegs for the tabernacle and for the court round about were of bronze.
### Materials of the Tabernacle
21 This is the sum of the things for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were counted at the commandment of Moses, for the work of the Levites under the direction of Ithʹamar the son of Aaron the priest.
22 Bezʹalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that theLordcommanded Moses;
23 and with him was Ohoʹliab the son of Ahisʹamach, of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman and designer and embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen.
24 All the gold that was used for the work, in all the construction of the sanctuary, the gold from the offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary.
25 And the silver from those of the congregation who were numbered was a hundred talents and a thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary:
26 a beka a head (that is, half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary), for every one who was numbered in the census, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty men.
27 The hundred talents of silver were for casting the bases of the sanctuary, and the bases of the veil; a hundred bases for the hundred talents, a talent for a base.
28 And of the thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals and made fillets for them.
29 And the bronze that was contributed was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels;
30 with it he made the bases for the door of the tent of meeting, the bronze altar and the bronze grating for it and all the utensils of the altar,
31 the bases round about the court, and the bases of the gate of the court, all the pegs of the tabernacle, and all the pegs round about the court.


# Liber Exodus 38 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Fecit et altare holocausti de lignis setim, quinque cubitorum per quadrum, et trium in altitudine:
2 cujus cornua de angulis procedebant, operuitque illum laminis æneis.
3 Et in usus ejus paravit ex ære vasa diversa, lebetes, forcipes, fuscinulas, uncinos, et ignium receptacula.
4 Craticulamque ejus in modum retis fecit æneam, et subter eam in altaris medio arulam,
5 fusis quatuor annulis per totidem retiaculi summitates, ad immittendos vectes ad portandum:
6 quos et ipsos fecit de lignis setim, et operuit laminis æneis:
7 induxitque in circulos, qui in lateribus altaris eminebant. Ipsum autem altare non erat solidum, sed cavum ex tabulis, et intus vacuum.

8 Fecit et labrum æneum cum basi sua de speculis mulierum, quæ excubabant in ostio tabernaculi.

9 Fecit et atrium, in cujus australi plaga erant tentoria de bysso retorta, cubitorum centum,
10 columnæ æneæ viginti cum basibus suis, capita columnarum, et tota operis cælatura, argentea.
11 Æque ad septentrionalem plagam tentoria columnæ, basesque et capita columnarum ejusdem mensuræ, et operis ac metalli, erant.
12 In ea vero plaga, quæ ad occidentem respicit, fuerunt tentoria cubitorum quinquaginta, columnæ decem cum basibus suis æneæ, et capita columnarum, et tota operis cælatura, argentea.
13 Porro contra orientem quinquaginta cubitorum paravit tentoria:
14 e quibus, quindecim cubitos columnarum trium, cum basibus suis, unum tenebat latus:
15 et in parte altera (quia inter utraque introitum tabernaculi fecit) quindecim æque cubitorum erant tentoria, columnæque tres, et bases totidem.
16 Cuncta atrii tentoria byssus retorta texuerat.
17 Bases columnarum fuere æneæ, capita autem earum cum cunctis cælaturis suis argentea: sed et ipsas columnas atrii vestivit argento.
18 Et in introitu ejus opere plumario fecit tentorium ex hyacintho, purpura, vermiculo, ac bysso retorta, quod habebat viginti cubitos in longitudine, altitudo vero quinque cubitorum erat juxta mensuram, quam cuncta atrii tentoria habebant.
19 Columnæ autem in ingressu fuere quatuor cum basibus æneis, capitaque earum et cælaturæ argenteæ.
20 Paxillos quoque tabernaculi et atrii per gyrum fecit æneos.

21 Hæc sunt instrumenta tabernaculi testimonii, quæ enumerata sunt juxta præceptum Moysi in cæremoniis Levitarum per manum Ithamar filii Aaron sacerdotis:
22 quæ Beseleel filius Uri filii Hur de tribu Juda, Domino per Moysen jubente, compleverat,
23 juncto sibi socio Ooliab filio Achisamech de tribu Dan: qui et ipse artifex lignorum egregius fuit, et polymitarius atque plumarius ex hyacintho, purpura, vermiculo et bysso.
24 Omne aurum quod expensum est in opere sanctuarii, et quod oblatum est in donariis, viginti novem talentorum fuit, et septingentorum triginta siclorum ad mensuram sanctuarii.
25 Oblatum est autem ab his qui transierunt ad numerum a viginti annis et supra, de sexcentis tribus millibus et quingentis quinquaginta armatorum.
26 Fuerunt præterea centum talenta argenti e quibus conflatæ sunt bases sanctuarii, et introitus, ubi velum pendet.
27 Centum bases factæ sunt de talentis centum, singulis talentis per bases singulas supputatis.
28 De mille autem septingentis et septuaginta quinque, fecit capita columnarum, quas et ipsas vestivit argento.
29 Æris quoque oblata sunt talenta septuaginta duo millia, et quadringenti supra sicli,
30 ex quibus fusæ sunt bases in introitu tabernaculi testimonii, et altare æneum cum craticula sua, omniaque vasa quæ ad usum ejus pertinent,
31 et bases atrii tam in circuitu quam in ingressu ejus, et paxilli tabernaculi atque atrii per gyrum.

21 οὗτος ἐποίησεν καὶ τοὺς πασσάλους τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ τοὺς πασσάλους τῆς αὐλῆς χαλκοῦς
22 οὗτος ἐποίησεν τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χαλκοῦν ἐκ τῶν πυρείων τῶν χαλκῶν ἃ ἦσαν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν τοῖς καταστασιάσασι μετὰ τῆς Κορε συναγωγῆς
