# Book of Joshua 9 (RSVCE)

### The Gibeonites Save Themselves by Trickery
1 When all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perʹizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebʹusites, heard of this,
2 they gathered together with one accord to fight Joshua and Israel.
3 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
4 they on their part acted with cunning, and went and made ready provisions, and took worn-out sacks upon their asses, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended,
5 with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes; and all their provisions were dry and moldy.
6 And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; so now make a covenant with us.”
7 But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a covenant with you?”
8 They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you? And where do you come from?”
9 They said to him, “From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of theLordyour God; for we have heard a report of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
10 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashʹtaroth.
11 And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants; come now, make a covenant with us.” ’
12 Here is our bread; it was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey, on the day we set forth to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and moldy;
13 these wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they are burst; and these garments and shoes of ours are worn out from the very long journey.”
14 So the men partook of their provisions, and did not ask direction from theLord.
15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.
16 At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.
17 And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephiʹrah, Be-erʹoth, and Kirʹiath-jeʹarim.
18 But the people of Israel did not kill them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by theLord, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders.
19 But all the leaders said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by theLord, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.
20 This we will do to them, and let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them.”
21 And the leaders said to them, “Let them live.” So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders had said of them.
22 Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, “Why did you deceive us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you dwell among us?
23 Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall always be slaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.”
24 They answered Joshua, “Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that theLordyour God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; so we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and did this thing.
25 And now, behold, we are in your hand: do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us.”
26 So he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel; and they did not kill them.
27 But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of theLord, to continue to this day, in the place which he should choose.


# Liber Josue 9 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Quibus auditis, cuncti reges trans Jordanem, qui versabantur in montanis et campestribus, in maritimis ac littore magni maris, hi quoque qui habitabant juxta Libanum, Hethæus et Amorrhæus, Chananæus, Pherezæus, et Hevæus, et Jebusæus,
2 congregati sunt pariter, ut pugnarent contra Josue et Israël uno animo, eademque sententia.
3 At hi qui habitabant in Gabaon, audientes cuncta quæ fecerat Josue Jericho, et Hai,
4 et callide cogitantes, tulerunt sibi cibaria, saccos veteres asinis imponentes, et utres vinarios scissos atque consutos,
5 calceamentaque perantiqua quæ ad indicium vetustatis pittaciis consuta erant, induti veteribus vestimentis: panes quoque, quos portabant ob viaticum, duri erant, et in frustra comminuti:
6 perrexeruntque ad Josue, qui tunc morabatur in castris Galgalæ, et dixerunt ei, atque simul omni Israëli: De terra longinqua venimus, pacem vobiscum facere cupientes. Responderuntque viri Israël ad eos, atque dixerunt:
7 Ne forte in terra, quæ nobis sorte debetur, habitetis, et non possimus fœdus inire vobiscum.
8 At illi ad Josue: Servi, inquiunt, tui sumus. Quibus Josue ait: Quinam estis vos? et unde venistis?
9 Responderunt: De terra longinqua valde venerunt servi tui in nomine Domini Dei tui. Audivimus enim famam potentiæ ejus, cuncta quæ fecit in Ægypto,
10 et duobus regibus Amorrhæorum qui fuerunt trans Jordanem, Sehon regi Hesebon, et Og regi Basan, qui erat in Astaroth:
11 dixeruntque nobis seniores, et omnes habitatores terræ nostræ: Tollite in manibus cibaria ob longissimam viam, et occurrite eis, et dicite: Servi vestri sumus: fœdus inite nobiscum.
12 En panes quando egressi sumus de domibus nostris, ut veniremus ad vos, calidos sumpsimus; nunc sicci facti sunt, et vetustate nimia comminuti.
13 Utres vini novos implevimus; nunc rupti sunt et soluti. Vestes et calceamenta quibus induimur, et quæ habemus in pedibus, ob longitudinem longioris viæ trita sunt, et pene consumpta.

14 Susceperunt igitur de cibariis eorum, et os Domini non interrogaverunt.
15 Fecitque Josue cum eis pacem, et inito fœdere pollicitus est quod non occiderentur: principes quoque multitudinis juraverunt eis.
16 Post dies autem tres initi fœderis, audierunt quod in vicino habitarent, et inter eos futuri essent.
17 Moveruntque castra filii Israël, et venerunt in civitates eorum die tertio, quarum hæc vocabula sunt: Gabaon, et Caphira, et Beroth, et Cariathiarim.
18 Et non percusserunt eos, eo quod jurassent eis principes multitudinis in nomine Domini Dei Israël. Murmuravit itaque omne vulgus contra principes.
19 Qui responderunt eis: Juravimus illis in nomine Domini Dei Israël, et idcirco non possumus eos contingere.
20 Sed hoc faciemus eis: reserventur quidem ut vivant, ne contra nos ira Domini concitetur, si pejeraverimus:
21 sed sic vivant, ut in usus universæ multitudinis ligna cædant, aquasque comportent. Quibus hæc loquentibus,
22 vocavit Gabaonitas Josue, et dixit eis: Cur nos decipere fraude voluistis, ut diceretis: Procul valde habitamus a vobis, cum in medio nostri sitis?
23 itaque sub maledictione eritis, et non deficiet de stirpe vestra ligna cædens, aquasque comportans in domum Dei mei.
24 Qui responderunt: Nuntiatum est nobis servis tuis, quod promisisset Dominus Deus tuus Moysi servo suo ut traderet vobis omnem terram, et disperderet cunctos habitatores ejus. Timuimus igitur valde, et providimus animabus nostris, vestro terrore compulsi, et hoc consilium inivimus.
25 Nunc autem in manu tua sumus: quod tibi bonum et rectum videtur, fac nobis.
26 Fecit ergo Josue ut dixerat, et liberavit eos de manu filiorum Israël, ut non occiderentur.
27 Decrevitque in illo die eos esse in ministerio cuncti populi, et altaris Domini, cædentes ligna, et aquas comportantes, usque in præsens tempus, in loco quem Dominus elegisset.


# Ἰησοῦς Nαυῆ 9 (Septuagint)

1 ὡς {D'} ἤκουσαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν Αμορραίων οἱ ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ιορδάνου οἱ ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ πεδινῇ καὶ οἱ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ παραλίᾳ τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς μεγάλης καὶ οἱ πρὸς τῷ Ἀντιλιβάνῳ καὶ οἱ Χετταῖοι καὶ οἱ Χαναναῖοι καὶ οἱ Φερεζαῖοι καὶ οἱ Ευαῖοι καὶ οἱ Αμορραῖοι καὶ οἱ Γεργεσαῖοι καὶ οἱ Ιεβουσαῖοι
2 συνήλθοσαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἐκπολεμῆσαι Ἰησοῦν καὶ Ισραηλ ἅμα πάντες
3 καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαβαων ἤκουσαν πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν κύριος τῇ Ιεριχω καὶ τῇ Γαι
4 καὶ ἐποίησαν καί γε αὐτοὶ μετὰ πανουργίας καὶ ἐλθόντες ἐπεσιτίσαντο καὶ ἡτοιμάσαντο καὶ λαβόντες σάκκους παλαιοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν ὄνων αὐτῶν καὶ ἀσκοὺς οἴνου παλαιοὺς καὶ κατερρωγότας ἀποδεδεμένους
5 καὶ τὰ κοῖλα τῶν ὑποδημάτων αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ σανδάλια αὐτῶν παλαιὰ καὶ καταπεπελματωμένα ἐν τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν πεπαλαιωμένα ἐπάνω αὐτῶν καὶ ὁ ἄρτος αὐτῶν τοῦ ἐπισιτισμοῦ ξηρὸς καὶ εὐρωτιῶν καὶ βεβρωμένος
6 καὶ ἤλθοσαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Ισραηλ εἰς Γαλγαλα καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν καὶ Ισραηλ ἐκ γῆς μακρόθεν ἥκαμεν καὶ νῦν διάθεσθε ἡμῖν διαθήκην
7 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πρὸς τὸν Χορραῖον ὅρα μὴ ἐν ἐμοὶ κατοικεῖς καὶ πῶς σοι διαθῶμαι διαθήκην
8 καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν οἰκέται σού ἐσμεν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς πόθεν ἐστὲ καὶ πόθεν παραγεγόνατε
9 καὶ εἶπαν ἐκ γῆς μακρόθεν σφόδρα ἥκασιν οἱ παῖδές σου ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ σου ἀκηκόαμεν γὰρ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ καὶ ὅσα ἐποίησεν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ
10 καὶ ὅσα ἐποίησεν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν τῶν Αμορραίων οἳ ἦσαν πέραν τοῦ Ιορδάνου τῷ Σηων βασιλεῖ Εσεβων καὶ τῷ Ωγ βασιλεῖ τῆς Βασαν ὃς κατῴκει ἐν Ασταρωθ καὶ ἐν Εδραϊν
11 καὶ ἀκούσαντες εἶπαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ἡμῶν καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν λέγοντες λάβετε ἑαυτοῖς ἐπισιτισμὸν εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν καὶ πορεύθητε εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐρεῖτε πρὸς αὐτούς οἰκέται σού ἐσμεν καὶ νῦν διάθεσθε ἡμῖν διαθήκην
12 οὗτοι οἱ ἄρτοι θερμοὺς ἐφωδιάσθημεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐξήλθομεν παραγενέσθαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς νῦν δὲ ἐξηράνθησαν καὶ γεγόνασιν βεβρωμένοι
13 καὶ οὗτοι οἱ ἀσκοὶ τοῦ οἴνου οὓς ἐπλήσαμεν καινούς καὶ οὗτοι ἐρρώγασιν καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια ἡμῶν καὶ τὰ ὑποδήματα ἡμῶν πεπαλαίωται ἀπὸ τῆς πολλῆς ὁδοῦ σφόδρα

14 καὶ ἔλαβον οἱ ἄρχοντες τοῦ ἐπισιτισμοῦ αὐτῶν καὶ κύριον οὐκ ἐπηρώτησαν
15 καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἰησοῦς πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰρήνην καὶ διέθετο πρὸς αὐτοὺς διαθήκην τοῦ διασῶσαι αὐτούς καὶ ὤμοσαν αὐτοῖς οἱ ἄρχοντες τῆς συναγωγῆς
16 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τρεῖς ἡμέρας μετὰ τὸ διαθέσθαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς διαθήκην ἤκουσαν ὅτι ἐγγύθεν αὐτῶν εἰσιν καὶ ὅτι ἐν αὐτοῖς κατοικοῦσιν
17 καὶ ἀπῆραν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν αἱ δὲ πόλεις αὐτῶν Γαβαων καὶ Κεφιρα καὶ Βηρωθ καὶ πόλις Ιαριν
18 καὶ οὐκ ἐμαχέσαντο αὐτοῖς οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ὅτι ὤμοσαν αὐτοῖς πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες κύριον τὸν θεὸν Ισραηλ καὶ διεγόγγυσαν πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσιν
19 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄρχοντες πάσῃ τῇ συναγωγῇ ἡμεῖς ὠμόσαμεν αὐτοῖς κύριον τὸν θεὸν Ισραηλ καὶ νῦν οὐ δυνησόμεθα ἅψασθαι αὐτῶν
20 τοῦτο ποιήσομεν ζωγρῆσαι αὐτούς καὶ περιποιησόμεθα αὐτούς καὶ οὐκ ἔσται κα{Q'} ἡμῶν ὀργὴ διὰ τὸν ὅρκον ὃν ὠμόσαμεν αὐτοῖς
21 ζήσονται καὶ ἔσονται ξυλοκόποι καὶ ὑδροφόροι πάσῃ τῇ συναγωγῇ καθάπερ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς οἱ ἄρχοντες
22 καὶ συνεκάλεσεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς διὰ τί παρελογίσασθέ με λέγοντες μακρὰν ἀπὸ σοῦ ἐσμεν σφόδρα ὑμεῖς δὲ ἐγχώριοί ἐστε τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν ἡμῖν
23 καὶ νῦν ἐπικατάρατοί ἐστε οὐ μὴ ἐκλίπῃ ἐξ ὑμῶν δοῦλος οὐδὲ ξυλοκόπος ἐμοὶ καὶ τῷ θεῷ μου
24 καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν τῷ Ἰησοῖ λέγοντες ἀνηγγέλη ἡμῖν ὅσα συνέταξεν κύριος ὁ θεός σου Μωυσῇ τῷ παιδὶ αὐτοῦ δοῦναι ὑμῖν τὴν γῆν ταύτην καὶ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι ἡμᾶς καὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν καὶ ἐφοβήθημεν σφόδρα περὶ τῶν ψυχῶν ἡμῶν ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν καὶ ἐποιήσαμεν τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο
25 καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς ὑποχείριοι ὑμῖν ὡς ἀρέσκει ὑμῖν καὶ ὡς δοκεῖ ὑμῖν ποιήσατε ἡμῖν
26 καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτοῖς οὕτως καὶ ἐξείλατο αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ χειρῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ καὶ οὐκ ἀνεῖλον αὐτούς
27 καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ξυλοκόπους καὶ ὑδροφόρους πάσῃ τῇ συναγωγῇ καὶ τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ τοῦ θεοῦ διὰ τοῦτο ἐγένοντο οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαβαων ξυλοκόποι καὶ ὑδροφόροι τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας καὶ εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν ἐὰν ἐκλέξηται κύριος
