# Book of Joshua 21 (RSVCE)

### Cities Allotted to the Levites
1 Then the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites came to Eleaʹzar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the people of Israel;
2 and they said to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, “TheLordcommanded through Moses that we be given cities to dwell in, along with their pasture lands for our cattle.”
3 So by command of theLordthe people of Israel gave to the Levites the following cities and pasture lands out of their inheritance.
4 The lot came out for the families of the Koʹhathites. So those Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, thirteen cities.
5 And the rest of the Koʹhathites received by lot from the families of the tribe of Eʹphraim, from the tribe of Dan and the half-tribe of Manasʹseh, ten cities.
6 The Gershonites received by lot from the families of the tribe of Isʹsachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphʹtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasʹseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
7 The Merarʹites according to their families received from the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and the tribe of Zebʹulun, twelve cities.
8 These cities and their pasture lands the people of Israel gave by lot to the Levites, as theLordhad commanded through Moses.
9 Out of the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Simeon they gave the following cities mentioned by name,
10 which went to the descendants of Aaron, one of the families of the Koʹhathites who belonged to the Levites; since the lot fell to them first.
11 They gave them Kirʹiath-arʹba (Arba being the father of Anak), that is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, along with the pasture lands round about it.
12 But the fields of the city and its villages had been given to Caleb the son of Jephunʹneh as his possession.
13 And to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the slayer, with its pasture lands, Libnah with its pasture lands,
14 Jattir with its pasture lands, Eshtemoʹa with its pasture lands,
15 Holon with its pasture lands, Debir with its pasture lands,
16 Aʹin with its pasture lands, Juttah with its pasture lands, Beth-sheʹmesh with its pasture lands—nine cities out of these two tribes;
17 then out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with its pasture lands,
18 Anʹathoth with its pasture lands, and Almon with its pasture lands—four cities.
19 The cities of the descendants of Aaron, the priests, were in all thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
20 As to the rest of the Koʹhathites belonging to the Koʹhathite families of the Levites, the cities allotted to them were out of the tribe of Eʹphraim.
21 To them were given Shechem, the city of refuge for the slayer, with its pasture lands in the hill country of Eʹphraim, Gezer with its pasture lands,
22 Kibʹza-im with its pasture lands, Beth-horʹon with its pasture lands—four cities;
23 and out of the tribe of Dan, Elʹteke with its pasture lands, Gibʹbethon with its pasture lands,
24 Aiʹjalon with its pasture lands, Gath-rimʹmon with its pasture lands—four cities;
25 and out of the half-tribe of Manasʹseh, Taʹanach with its pasture lands, and Gath-rimʹmon with its pasture lands—two cities.
26 The cities of the families of the rest of the Koʹhathites were ten in all with their pasture lands.
27 And to the Gershonites, one of the families of the Levites, were given out of the half-tribe of Manasʹseh, Golan in Bashan with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the slayer, and Be-eshʹterah with its pasture lands—two cities;
28 and out of the tribe of Isʹsachar, Kishʹion with its pasture lands, Dabʹerath with its pasture lands,
29 Jarmuth with its pasture lands, En-ganʹnim with its pasture lands—four cities;
30 and out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands,
31 Helkath with its pasture lands, and Rehob with its pasture lands—four cities;
32 and out of the tribe of Naphʹtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the slayer, Hamʹmoth-dor with its pasture lands, and Kartan with its pasture lands—three cities.
33 The cities of the several families of the Gershonites were in all thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
34 And to the rest of the Levites, the Merarʹite families, were given out of the tribe of Zebʹulun, Jokʹne-am with its pasture lands, Kartah with its pasture lands,
35 Dimnah with its pasture lands, Naʹhalal with its pasture lands—four cities;
36 and out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its pasture lands, Jahaz with its pasture lands,
37 Kedʹemoth with its pasture lands, and Mephʹa-ath with its pasture lands—four cities;
38 and out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the slayer, Mahanaʹim with its pasture lands,
39 Heshbon with its pasture lands, Jazer with its pasture lands—four cities in all.
40 As for the cities of the several Merarʹite families, that is, the remainder of the families of the Levites, those allotted to them were in all twelve cities.
41 The cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the people of Israel were in all forty-eight cities with their pasture lands.
42 These cities had each its pasture lands round about it; so it was with all these cities.
43 Thus theLordgave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers; and having taken possession of it, they settled there.
44 And theLordgave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their fathers; not one of all their enemies had withstood them, for theLordhad given all their enemies into their hands.
45 Not one of all the good promises which theLordhad made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass.


# Liber Josue 21 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Accesseruntque principes familiarum Levi ad Eleazarum sacerdotem, et Josue filium Nun, et ad duces cognationum per singulas tribus filiorum Israël:
2 locutique sunt ad eos in Silo terræ Chanaan, atque dixerunt: Dominus præcepit per manum Moysi, ut darentur nobis urbes ad habitandum, et suburbana earum ad alenda jumenta.
3 Dederuntque filii Israël de possessionibus suis juxta imperium Domini, civitates et suburbana earum.

4 Egressaque est sors in familiam Caath filiorum Aaron sacerdotis, de tribubus Juda, et Simeon, et Benjamin, civitates tredecim:
5 et reliquis filiorum Caath, id est Levitis, qui superfuerant, de tribubus Ephraim, et Dan, et dimidia tribu Manasse, civitates decem.
6 Porro filii Gerson egressa est sors, ut acciperent de tribubus Issachar et Aser et Nephthali, dimidiaque tribu Manasse in Basan, civitates numero tredecim.
7 Et filiis Merari per cognationes suas de tribubus Ruben et Gad et Zabulon urbes duodecim.
8 Dederuntque filii Israël Levitis civitates et suburbana earum, sicut præcepit Dominus per manum Moysi, singulis sorte tribuentes.

9 De tribubus filiorum Juda et Simeon dedit Josue civitates, quarum ista sunt nomina,
10 filiis Aaron per familias Caath Levitici generis (prima enim sors illis egressa est),
11 Cariatharbe patris Enac, quæ vocatur Hebron, in monte Juda, et suburbana ejus per circuitum.
12 Agros vero et villas ejus dederat Caleb filio Jephone ad possidendum.
13 Dedit ergo filiis Aaron sacerdotis Hebron confugii civitatem, ac suburbana ejus: et Lobnam cum suburbanis suis:
14 et Jether, et Esthemo,
15 et Holon, et Dabir,
16 et Ain, et Jeta, et Bethsames, cum suburbanis suis: civitates novem de tribubus, ut dictum est, duabus.
17 De tribu autem filiorum Benjamin, Gabaon, et Gabæ,
18 et Anathoth et Almon, cum suburbanis suis: civitates quatuor.
19 Omnes simul civitates filiorum Aaron sacerdotis, tredecim, cum suburbanis suis.
20 Reliquis vero per familias filiorum Caath Levitici generis, hæc est data possessio.
21 De tribu Ephraim urbes confugii, Sichem cum suburbanis suis in monte Ephraim, et Gazer
22 et Cibsaim et Beth-horon, cum suburbanis suis, civitates quatuor.
23 De tribu quoque Dan, Eltheco et Gabathon,
24 et Ajalon et Gethremmon, cum suburbanis suis, civitates quatuor.
25 Porro de dimidia tribu Manasse, Thanach et Gethremmon, cum suburbanis suis, civitates duæ.
26 Omnes civitates decem, et suburbana earum, datæ sunt filiis Caath inferioris gradus.

27 Filiis quoque Gerson Levitici generis dedit de dimidia tribu Manasse confugii civitates, Gaulon in Basan, et Bosram, cum suburbanis suis, civitates duas.
28 Porro de tribu Issachar, Cesion, et Dabereth,
29 et Jaramoth, et Engannim, cum suburbanis suis, civitates quatuor.
30 De tribu autem Aser, Masal et Abdon,
31 et Helcath, et Rohob, cum suburbanis suis, civitates quatuor.
32 De tribu quoque Nephthali civitates confugii, Cedes in Galilæa, et Hammoth Dor, et Carthan, cum suburbanis suis, civitates tres.
33 Omnes urbes familiarum Gerson, tredecim, cum suburbanis suis.

34 Filiis autem Merari Levitis inferioris gradus per familias suas data est de tribu Zabulon, Jecnam, et Cartha
35 et Damna et Naalol, civitates quatuor cum suburbanis suis.
36 De tribu Ruben ultra Jordanem contra Jericho civitates refugii, Bosor in solitudine, Misor et Jaser et Jethson et Mephaath, civitates quatuor cum suburbanis suis.
37 De tribu Gad civitates confugii, Ramoth in Galaad, et Manaim

39 et Hesebon et Jazer, civitates quatuor cum suburbanis suis.
40 Omnes urbes filiorum Merari per familias et cognationes suas, duodecim.

41 Itaque civitates universæ Levitarum in medio possessionis filiorum Israël fuerunt quadraginta octo
42 cum suburbanis suis, singulæ per familias distributæ.
43 Deditque Dominus Deus Israëli omnem terram, quam traditurum se patribus eorum juraverat: et possederunt illam, atque habitaverunt in ea.
