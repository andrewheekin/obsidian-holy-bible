# Book of Joshua 7 (RSVCE)

### The Sin of Achan and Its Punishment
1 But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things; for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things; and the anger of theLordburned against the people of Israel.
2 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aʹven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” And the men went up and spied out Ai.
3 And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, “Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai; do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are but few.”
4 So about three thousand went up there from the people; and they fled before the men of Ai,
5 and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six men of them, and chased them before the gate as far as Shebʹarim, and slew them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
6 Then Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of theLorduntil the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.
7 And Joshua said, “Alas, O LordGod, why hast thou brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!
8 O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!
9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name?”
10 TheLordsaid to Joshua, “Arise, why have you thus fallen upon your face?
11 Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant which I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, and lied, and put them among their own stuff.
12 Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become a thing for destruction. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.
13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says theLord, God of Israel, “There are devoted things in the midst of you, O Israel; you cannot stand before your enemies, until you take away the devoted things from among you.”
14 In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes; and the tribe which theLordtakes shall come near by families; and the family which theLordtakes shall come near by households; and the household which theLordtakes shall come near man by man.
15 And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of theLord, and because he has done a shameful thing in Israel.’ ”
16 So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken;
17 and he brought near the families of Judah, and the family of the Zerʹahites was taken; and he brought near the family of the Zerʹahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken;
18 and he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
19 Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to theLordGod of Israel, and render praise to him; and tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.”
20 And Achan answered Joshua, “Of a truth I have sinned against theLordGod of Israel, and this is what I did:
21 when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them, and took them; and behold, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”
22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.
23 And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the people of Israel; and they laid them down before theLord.
24 And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the mantle and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters, and his oxen and asses and sheep, and his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.
25 And Joshua said, “Why did you bring trouble on us? TheLordbrings trouble on you today.” And all Israel stoned him with stones; they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day; then theLordturned from his burning anger. Therefore to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor.


# Liber Josue 7 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Filii autem Israël prævaricati sunt mandatum, et usurpaverunt de anathemate. Nam Achan filius Charmi filii Zabdi filii Zare de tribu Juda tulit aliquid de anathemate: iratusque est Dominus contra filios Israël.
2 Cumque mitteret Josue de Jericho viros contra Hai, quæ est juxta Bethaven, ad orientalem plagam oppidi Bethel, dixit eis: Ascendite, et explorate terram. Qui præcepta complentes exploraverunt Hai.
3 Et reversi dixerunt ei: Non ascendat omnis populus, sed duo vel tria millia virorum pergant, et deleant civitatem: quare omnis populus frustra vexabitur contra hostes paucissimos?
4 Ascenderunt ergo tria millia pugnatorum. Qui statim terga vertentes,
5 percussi sunt a viris urbis Hai, et corruerunt ex eis triginta sex homines: persecutique sunt eos adversarii de porta usque ad Sabarim, et ceciderunt per prona fugientes: pertimuitque cor populi, et instar aquæ liquefactum est.
6 Josue vero scidit vestimenta sua, et pronus cecidit in terram coram arca Domini usque ad vesperam, tam ipse quam omnes senes Israël: miseruntque pulverem super capita sua,
7 et dixit Josue: Heu Domine Deus, quid voluisti traducere populum istum Jordanem fluvium, ut traderes nos in manus Amorrhæi, et perderes? utinam ut cœpimus, mansissemus trans Jordanem.
8 Mi Domine Deus, quid dicam, videns Israëlem hostibus suis terga vertentem?
9 Audient Chananæi, et omnes habitatores terræ, et pariter conglobati circumdabunt nos, atque delebunt nomen nostrum de terra: et quid facies magno nomini tuo?

10 Dixitque Dominus ad Josue: Surge: cur jaces pronus in terra?
11 Peccavit Israël, et prævaricatus est pactum meum: tuleruntque de anathemate, et furati sunt atque mentiti, et absconderunt inter vasa sua.
12 Nec poterit Israël stare ante hostes suos, eosque fugiet: quia pollutus est anathemate. Non ero ultra vobiscum, donec conteratis eum qui hujus sceleris reus est.
13 Surge, sanctifica populum, et dic eis: Sanctificamini in crastinum: hæc enim dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Anathema in medio tui est, Israël: non poteris stare coram hostibus tuis, donec deleatur ex te qui hoc contaminatus est scelere.
14 Accedetisque mane singuli per tribus vestras: et quamcumque tribum sors invenerit, accedet per cognationes suas, et cognatio per domos, domusque per viros.
15 Et quicumque ille in hoc facinore fuerit deprehensus, comburetur igni cum omni substantia sua: quoniam prævaricatus est pactum Domini, et fecit nefas in Israël.

16 Surgens itaque Josue mane, applicuit Israël per tribus suas, et inventa est tribus Juda.
17 Quæ cum juxta familias suas esset oblata, inventa est familia Zare. Illam quoque per domos offerens, reperit Zabdi:
18 cujus domum in singulos dividens viros, invenit Achan filium Charmi filii Zabdi filii Zare de tribu Juda.
19 Et ait Josue ad Achan: Fili mi, da gloriam Domino Deo Israël, et confitere, atque indica mihi quid feceris, ne abscondas.
20 Responditque Achan Josue, et dixit ei: Vere ego peccavi Domino Deo Israël, et sic et sic feci.
21 Vidi enim inter spolia pallium coccineum valde bonum, et ducentos siclos argenti, regulamque auream quinquaginta siclorum: et concupiscens abstuli, et abscondi in terra contra medium tabernaculi mei, argentumque fossa humo operui.

22 Misit ergo Josue ministros: qui currentes ad tabernaculum illius, repererunt cuncta abscondita in eodem loco, et argentum simul.
23 Auferentesque de tentorio, tulerunt ea ad Josue, et ad omnes filios Israël, projeceruntque ante Dominum.
24 Tollens itaque Josue Achan filium Zare, argentumque et pallium, et auream regulam, filios quoque et filias ejus, boves et asinos et oves, ipsumque tabernaculum, et cunctam supellectilem (et omnis Israël cum eo), duxerunt eos ad vallem Achor:
25 ubi dixit Josue: Quia turbasti nos, exturbet te Dominus in die hac. Lapidavitque eum omnis Israël: et cuncta quæ illius erant, igne consumpta sunt.
26 Congregaveruntque super eum acervum magnum lapidum, qui permanet usque in præsentem diem. Et aversus est furor Domini ab eis. Vocatumque est nomen loci illius, vallis Achor, usque hodie.

1 καὶ ἐπλημμέλησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πλημμέλειαν μεγάλην καὶ ἐνοσφίσαντο ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναθέματος καὶ ἔλαβεν Αχαρ υἱὸς Χαρμι υἱοῦ Ζαμβρι υἱοῦ Ζαρα ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Ιουδα ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναθέματος καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ κύριος τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ
2 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰησοῦς ἄνδρας εἰς Γαι ἥ ἐστιν κατὰ Βαιθηλ λέγων κατασκέψασθε τὴν Γαι καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ ἄνδρες καὶ κατεσκέψαντο τὴν Γαι
3 καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν μὴ ἀναβήτω πᾶς ὁ λαός ἀλ{L'} ὡς δισχίλιοι ἢ τρισχίλιοι ἄνδρες ἀναβήτωσαν καὶ ἐκπολιορκησάτωσαν τὴν πόλιν μὴ ἀναγάγῃς ἐκεῖ τὸν λαὸν πάντα ὀλίγοι γάρ εἰσιν
4 καὶ ἀνέβησαν ὡσεὶ τρισχίλιοι ἄνδρες καὶ ἔφυγον ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν ἀνδρῶν Γαι
5 καὶ ἀπέκτειναν ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν ἄνδρες Γαι εἰς τριάκοντα καὶ ἓξ ἄνδρας καὶ κατεδίωξαν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς πύλης καὶ συνέτριψαν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τοῦ καταφεροῦς καὶ ἐπτοήθη ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ἐγένετο ὥσπερ ὕδωρ
6 καὶ διέρρηξεν Ἰησοῦς τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔπεσεν Ἰησοῦς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐναντίον κυρίου ἕως ἑσπέρας αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπεβάλοντο χοῦν ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν
7 καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς δέομαι κύριε ἵνα τί διεβίβασεν ὁ παῖς σου τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον τὸν Ιορδάνην παραδοῦναι αὐτὸν τῷ Αμορραίῳ ἀπολέσαι ἡμᾶς καὶ εἰ κατεμείναμεν καὶ κατῳκίσθημεν παρὰ τὸν Ιορδάνην
8 καὶ τί ἐρῶ ἐπεὶ μετέβαλεν Ισραηλ αὐχένα ἀπέναντι τοῦ ἐχθροῦ αὐτοῦ
9 καὶ ἀκούσας ὁ Χαναναῖος καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν περικυκλώσουσιν ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐκτρίψουσιν ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ τί ποιήσεις τὸ ὄνομά σου τὸ μέγα

10 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν ἀνάστηθι ἵνα τί τοῦτο σὺ πέπτωκας ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν σου
11 ἡμάρτηκεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ παρέβη τὴν διαθήκην ἣν διεθέμην πρὸς αὐτούς καὶ κλέψαντες ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναθέματος ἐνέβαλον εἰς τὰ σκεύη αὐτῶν
12 οὐ μὴ δύνωνται οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ὑποστῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν αὐχένα ἐπιστρέψουσιν ἔναντι τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν ὅτι ἐγενήθησαν ἀνάθεμα οὐ προσθήσω ἔτι εἶναι με{Q'} ὑμῶν ἐὰν μὴ ἐξάρητε τὸ ἀνάθεμα ἐξ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν
13 ἀναστὰς ἁγίασον τὸν λαὸν καὶ εἰπὸν ἁγιασθῆναι εἰς αὔριον τάδε λέγει κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ τὸ ἀνάθεμα ἐν ὑμῖν ἐστιν οὐ δυνήσεσθε ἀντιστῆναι ἀπέναντι τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν ἕως ἂν ἐξάρητε τὸ ἀνάθεμα ἐξ ὑμῶν
14 καὶ συναχθήσεσθε πάντες τὸ πρωὶ κατὰ φυλάς καὶ ἔσται ἡ φυλή ἣν ἂν δείξῃ κύριος προσάξετε κατὰ δήμους καὶ τὸν δῆμον ὃν ἐὰν δείξῃ κύριος προσάξετε κα{T'} οἶκον καὶ τὸν οἶκον ὃν ἐὰν δείξῃ κύριος προσάξετε κα{T'} ἄνδρα
15 καὶ ὃς ἂν ἐνδειχθῇ κατακαυθήσεται ἐν πυρὶ καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν αὐτῷ ὅτι παρέβη τὴν διαθήκην κυρίου καὶ ἐποίησεν ἀνόμημα ἐν Ισραηλ

16 καὶ ὤρθρισεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ προσήγαγεν τὸν λαὸν κατὰ φυλάς καὶ ἐνεδείχθη ἡ φυλὴ Ιουδα
17 καὶ προσήχθη κατὰ δήμους καὶ ἐνεδείχθη δῆμος ὁ Ζαραϊ καὶ προσήχθη κατὰ ἄνδρα
18 καὶ ἐνεδείχθη Αχαρ υἱὸς Ζαμβρι υἱοῦ Ζαρα
19 καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς τῷ Αχαρ δὸς δόξαν σήμερον τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ Ισραηλ καὶ δὸς τὴν ἐξομολόγησιν καὶ ἀνάγγειλόν μοι τί ἐποίησας καὶ μὴ κρύψῃς ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ
20 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Αχαρ τῷ Ἰησοῖ καὶ εἶπεν ἀληθῶς ἥμαρτον ἐναντίον κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ οὕτως καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησα
21 εἶδον ἐν τῇ προνομῇ ψιλὴν ποικίλην καλὴν καὶ διακόσια δίδραχμα ἀργυρίου καὶ γλῶσσαν μίαν χρυσῆν πεντήκοντα διδράχμων καὶ ἐνθυμηθεὶς αὐτῶν ἔλαβον καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὰ ἐγκέκρυπται ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ μου καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον κέκρυπται ὑποκάτω αὐτῶν

22 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰησοῦς ἀγγέλους καὶ ἔδραμον εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν καὶ ταῦτα ἦν ἐγκεκρυμμένα εἰς τὴν σκηνήν καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον ὑποκάτω αὐτῶν
23 καὶ ἐξήνεγκαν αὐτὰ ἐκ τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ ἤνεγκαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ισραηλ καὶ ἔθηκαν αὐτὰ ἔναντι κυρίου
24 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰησοῦς τὸν Αχαρ υἱὸν Ζαρα καὶ ἀνήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς φάραγγα Αχωρ καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς μόσχους αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ ὑποζύγια αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ πρόβατα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνήγαγεν αὐτοὺς εἰς Εμεκαχωρ
25 καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς τῷ Αχαρ τί ὠλέθρευσας ἡμᾶς ἐξολεθρεύσαι σε κύριος καθὰ καὶ σήμερον καὶ ἐλιθοβόλησαν αὐτὸν λίθοις πᾶς Ισραηλ
26 καὶ ἐπέστησαν αὐτῷ σωρὸν λίθων μέγαν καὶ ἐπαύσατο κύριος τοῦ θυμοῦ τῆς ὀργῆς διὰ τοῦτο ἐπωνόμασεν αὐτὸ Εμεκαχωρ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
