# Book of Joshua 10 (RSVCE)

### The Sun Stands Still
1 When Adoʹni-zeʹdek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,
2 he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
3 So Adoʹni-zeʹdek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhiʹa king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
4 “Come up to me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel.”
5 Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered their forces, and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.
6 And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, “Do not relax your hand from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country are gathered against us.”
7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
8 And theLordsaid to Joshua, “Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands; there shall not a man of them stand before you.”
9 So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal.
10 And theLordthrew them into a panic before Israel, who slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horʹon, and smote them as far as Azeʹkah and Makkeʹdah.
11 And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-horʹon, theLordthrew down great stones from heaven upon them as far as Azeʹkah, and they died; there were more who died because of the hailstones than the men of Israel killed with the sword.
12 Then spoke Joshua to theLordin the day when theLordgave the Amorites over to the men of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, “Sun, stand thou still at Gibeon, and thou Moon in the valley of Aiʹjalon.”
13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.
14 There has been no day like it before or since, when theLordhearkened to the voice of a man; for theLordfought for Israel.
15 Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
### Five Kings Defeated
16 These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkeʹdah.
17 And it was told Joshua, “The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkeʹdah.”
18 And Joshua said, “Roll great stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;
19 but do not stay there yourselves, pursue your enemies, fall upon their rear, do not let them enter their cities; for theLordyour God has given them into your hand.”
20 When Joshua and the men of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter, until they were wiped out, and when the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,
21 all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkeʹdah; not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.
22 Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out to me from the cave.”
23 And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
24 And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings.” Then they came near, and put their feet on their necks.
25 And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and of good courage; for thus theLordwill do to all your enemies against whom you fight.”
26 And afterward Joshua smote them and put them to death, and he hung them on five trees. And they hung upon the trees until evening;
27 but at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set great stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.
28 And Joshua took Makkeʹdah on that day, and smote it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed every person in it, he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkeʹdah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
29 Then Joshua passed on from Makkeʹdah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah;
30 and theLordgave it also and its king into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left none remaining in it; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
31 And Joshua passed on from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and laid siege to it, and assaulted it:
32 and theLordgave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.
33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he left none remaining.
34 And Joshua passed on with all Israel from Lachish to Eglon; and they laid siege to it, and assaulted it;
35 and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and every person in it he utterly destroyed that day, as he had done to Lachish.
36 Then Joshua went up with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron; and they assaulted it,
37 and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it; he left none remaining, as he had done to Eglon, and utterly destroyed it with every person in it.
38 Then Joshua, with all Israel, turned back to Debir and assaulted it,
39 and he took it with its king and all its towns; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person in it; he left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and to its king.
40 So Joshua defeated the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as theLordGod of Israel commanded.
41 And Joshua defeated them from Kaʹdesh-barʹnea to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, as far as Gibeon.
42 And Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because theLordGod of Israel fought for Israel.
43 Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.


# Liber Josue 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Quæ cum audisset Adonisedec rex Jerusalem, quod scilicet cepisset Josue Hai, et subvertisset eam (sicut enim fecerat Jericho et regi ejus, sic fecit Hai et regi illius), et quod transfugissent Gabaonitæ ad Israël, et essent fœderati eorum,
2 timuit valde. Urbs enim magna erat Gabaon, et una civitatum regalium, et major oppido Hai, omnesque bellatores ejus fortissimi.
3 Misit ergo Adonisedec rex Jerusalem ad Oham regem Hebron, et ad Pharam regem Jerimoth, ad Japhia quoque regem Lachis, et ad Dabir regem Eglon, dicens:
4 Ad me ascendite, et ferte præsidium, ut expugnemus Gabaon, quare transfugerit ad Josue, et ad filios Israël.
5 Congregati igitur ascenderunt quinque reges Amorrhæorum: rex Jerusalem, rex Hebron, rex Jerimoth, rex Lachis, rex Eglon, simul cum exercitibus suis: et castrametati sunt circa Gabaon, oppugnantes eam.
6 Habitatores autem Gabaon urbis obsessæ miserunt ad Josue, qui tunc morabatur in castris apud Galgalam, et dixerunt ei: Ne retrahas manus tuas ab auxilio servorum tuorum: ascende cito, et libera nos, ferque præsidium: convenerunt enim adversum nos omnes reges Amorrhæorum, qui habitant in montanis.

7 Ascenditque Josue de Galgalis, et omnis exercitus bellatorum cum eo, viri fortissimi.
8 Dixitque Dominus ad Josue: Ne timeas eos: in manus enim tuas tradidi illos: nullus ex eis tibi resistere poterit.
9 Irruit itaque Josue super eos repente, tota nocte ascendens de Galgalis.
10 Et conturbavit eos Dominus a facie Israël: contrivitque plaga magna in Gabaon, ac persecutus est eos per viam ascensus Bethoron, et percussit usque Azeca et Maceda.
11 Cumque fugerent filios Israël, et essent in descensu Bethoron, Dominus misit super eos lapides magnos de cælo usque ad Azeca: et mortui sunt multo plures lapidibus grandinis, quam quos gladio percusserant filii Israël.

12 Tunc locutus est Josue Domino, in die qua tradidit Amorrhæum in conspectu filiorum Israël, dixitque coram eis:Sol, contra Gabaon ne movearis,et luna contra vallem Ajalon.
13 Steteruntque sol et luna,donec ulcisceretur se gens de inimicis suis.Nonne scriptum est hoc in libro justorum? Stetit itaque sol in medio cæli, et non festinavit occumbere spatio unius diei.
14 Non fuit antea nec postea tam longa dies, obediente Domino voci hominis, et pugnante pro Israël.
15 Reversusque est Josue cum omni Israël in castra Galgalæ.

16 Fugerant enim quinque reges et se absconderant in spelunca urbis Maceda.
17 Nuntiatumque est Josue quod inventi essent quinque reges latentes in spelunca urbis Maceda.
18 Qui præcepit sociis, et ait: Volvite saxa ingentia ad os speluncæ, et ponite viros industrios, qui clausos custodiant:
19 vos autem nolite stare, sed persequimini hostes, et extremos quosque fugientium cædite: nec dimittatis eos urbium suarum intrare præsidia, quos tradidit Dominus Deus in manus vestras.
20 Cæsis ergo adversariis plaga magna, et usque ad internecionem pene consumptis, hi qui Israël effugere potuerunt, ingressi sunt civitates munitas.
21 Reversusque est omnis exercitus ad Josue in Maceda, ubi tunc erant castra, sani et integro numero: nullusque contra filios Israël mutire ausus est.
22 Præcepitque Josue, dicens: Aperite os speluncæ, et producite ad me quinque reges, qui in ea latitant.
23 Feceruntque ministri ut sibi fuerat imperatum: et eduxerunt ad eum quinque reges de spelunca, regem Jerusalem, regem Hebron, regem Jerimoth, regem Lachis, regem Eglon.
24 Cumque educti essent ad eum, vocavit omnes viros Israël, et ait ad principes exercitus qui secum erant: Ite, et ponite pedes super colla regum istorum. Qui cum perrexissent, et subjectorum colla pedibus calcarent,
25 rursum ait ad eos: Nolite timere, nec paveatis: confortamini, et estote robusti: sic enim faciet Dominus cunctis hostibus vestris, adversum quos dimicatis.
26 Percussitque Josue, et interfecit eos, atque suspendit super quinque stipites: fueruntque suspensi usque ad vesperum.
27 Cumque occumberet sol, præcepit sociis ut deponerent eos de patibulis. Qui depositos projecerunt in speluncam in qua latuerant, et posuerunt super os ejus saxa ingentia, quæ permanent usque in præsens.

28 Eodem quoque die, Macedam cepit Josue, et percussit eam in ore gladii, regemque illius interfecit, et omnes habitatores ejus: non dimisit in ea saltem parvas reliquias. Fecitque regi Maceda sicut fecerat regi Jericho.
29 Transivit autem cum omni Israël de Maceda in Lebna, et pugnabat contra eam:
30 quam tradidit Dominus cum rege suo in manus Israël: percusseruntque urbem in ore gladii, et omnes habitatores ejus: non dimiserunt in ea ullas reliquias. Feceruntque regi Lebna sicut fecerant regi Jericho.
31 De Lebna transivit in Lachis cum omni Israël: et exercitu per gyrum disposito, oppugnabat eam.
32 Tradiditque Dominus Lachis in manus Israël, et cepit eam die altero, atque percussit in ore gladii, omnemque animam quæ fuerat in ea, sicut fecerat Lebna.
33 Eo tempore ascendit Horam rex Gazer, ut auxiliaretur Lachis: quem percussit Josue cum omni populo ejus usque ad internecionem.
34 Transivitque de Lachis in Eglon, et circumdedit,
35 atque expugnavit eam eadem die: percussitque in ore gladii omnes animas quæ erant in ea, juxta omnia quæ fecerat Lachis.
36 Ascendit quoque cum omni Israël de Eglon in Hebron, et pugnavit contra eam:
37 cepit eam, et percussit in ore gladii, regem quoque ejus, et omnia oppida regionis illius, universasque animas quæ in ea fuerant commoratæ: non reliquit in ea ullas reliquias: sicut fecerat Eglon, sic fecit et Hebron, cuncta quæ in ea reperit consumens gladio.
38 Inde reversus in Dabir,
39 cepit eam atque vastavit: regem quoque ejus atque omnia per circuitum oppida percussit in ore gladii: non dimisit in ea ullas reliquias: sicut fecerat Hebron et Lebna et regibus earum, sic fecit Dabir et regi illius.

40 Percussit itaque Josue omnem terram montanam et meridianam atque campestrem, et Asedoth, cum regibus suis: non dimisit in ea ullas reliquias, sed omne quod spirare poterat interfecit, sicut præceperat ei Dominus Deus Israël,
41 a Cadesbarne usque Gazam. Omnem terram Gosen usque Gabaon,
42 universosque reges, et regiones eorum uno impetu cepit atque vastavit: Dominus enim Deus Israël pugnavit pro eo.
43 Reversusque est cum omni Israël ad locum castrorum in Galgala.


# Ἰησοῦς Nαυῆ 10 (Septuagint)

1 ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν Αδωνιβεζεκ βασιλεὺς Ιερουσαλημ ὅτι ἔλαβεν Ἰησοῦς τὴν Γαι καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσεν αὐτήν ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τὴν Ιεριχω καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς οὕτως ἐποίησαν τὴν Γαι καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς καὶ ὅτι αὐτομόλησαν οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαβαων πρὸς Ἰησοῦν καὶ πρὸς Ισραηλ
2 καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν ἐν αὐτοῖς σφόδρα ᾔδει γὰρ ὅτι μεγάλη πόλις Γαβαων ὡσεὶ μία τῶν μητροπόλεων καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτῆς ἰσχυροί
3 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Αδωνιβεζεκ βασιλεὺς Ιερουσαλημ πρὸς Αιλαμ βασιλέα Χεβρων καὶ πρὸς Φιδων βασιλέα Ιεριμουθ καὶ πρὸς Ιεφθα βασιλέα Λαχις καὶ πρὸς Δαβιρ βασιλέα Οδολλαμ λέγων
4 δεῦτε ἀνάβητε πρός με καὶ βοηθήσατέ μοι καὶ ἐκπολεμήσωμεν Γαβαων αὐτομόλησαν γὰρ πρὸς Ἰησοῦν καὶ πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ
5 καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ πέντε βασιλεῖς τῶν Ιεβουσαίων βασιλεὺς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ βασιλεὺς Χεβρων καὶ βασιλεὺς Ιεριμουθ καὶ βασιλεὺς Λαχις καὶ βασιλεὺς Οδολλαμ αὐτοὶ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς αὐτῶν καὶ περιεκάθισαν τὴν Γαβαων καὶ ἐξεπολιόρκουν αὐτήν
6 καὶ ἀπέστειλαν οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαβαων πρὸς Ἰησοῦν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Ισραηλ εἰς Γαλγαλα λέγοντες μὴ ἐκλύσῃς τὰς χεῖράς σου ἀπὸ τῶν παίδων σου ἀνάβηθι πρὸς ἡμᾶς τὸ τάχος καὶ ἐξελοῦ ἡμᾶς καὶ βοήθησον ἡμῖν ὅτι συνηγμένοι εἰσὶν ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν Αμορραίων οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν ὀρεινήν

7 καὶ ἀνέβη Ἰησοῦς ἐκ Γαλγαλων αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ πολεμιστὴς με{T'} αὐτοῦ πᾶς δυνατὸς ἐν ἰσχύι
8 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν μὴ φοβηθῇς αὐτούς εἰς γὰρ τὰς χεῖράς σου παραδέδωκα αὐτούς οὐχ ὑπολειφθήσεται ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐθεὶς ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν
9 καὶ ἐπιπαρεγένετο ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς ἄφνω ὅλην τὴν νύκτα εἰσεπορεύθη ἐκ Γαλγαλων
10 καὶ ἐξέστησεν αὐτοὺς κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ καὶ συνέτριψεν αὐτοὺς κύριος σύντριψιν μεγάλην ἐν Γαβαων καὶ κατεδίωξαν αὐτοὺς ὁδὸν ἀναβάσεως Ωρωνιν καὶ κατέκοπτον αὐτοὺς ἕως Αζηκα καὶ ἕως Μακηδα
11 ἐν τῷ δὲ φεύγειν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ ἐπὶ τῆς καταβάσεως Ωρωνιν καὶ κύριος ἐπέρριψεν αὐτοῖς λίθους χαλάζης ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἕως Αζηκα καὶ ἐγένοντο πλείους οἱ ἀποθανόντες διὰ τοὺς λίθους τῆς χαλάζης ἢ οὓς ἀπέκτειναν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ μαχαίρᾳ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ

12 τότε ἐλάλησεν Ἰησοῦς πρὸς κύριον ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ παρέδωκεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν Αμορραῖον ὑποχείριον Ισραηλ ἡνίκα συνέτριψεν αὐτοὺς ἐν Γαβαων καὶ συνετρίβησαν ἀπὸ προσώπου υἱῶν Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς στήτω ὁ ἥλιος κατὰ Γαβαων καὶ ἡ σελήνη κατὰ φάραγγα Αιλων
13 καὶ ἔστη ὁ ἥλιος καὶ ἡ σελήνη ἐν στάσει ἕως ἠμύνατο ὁ θεὸς τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτῶν καὶ ἔστη ὁ ἥλιος κατὰ μέσον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ οὐ προεπορεύετο εἰς δυσμὰς εἰς τέλος ἡμέρας μιᾶς
14 καὶ οὐκ ἐγένετο ἡμέρα τοιαύτη οὐδὲ τὸ πρότερον οὐδὲ τὸ ἔσχατον ὥστε ἐπακοῦσαι θεὸν ἀνθρώπου ὅτι κύριος συνεπολέμησεν τῷ Ισραηλ
15

16 καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ πέντε βασιλεῖς οὗτοι καὶ κατεκρύβησαν εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον τὸ ἐν Μακηδα
17 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ἰησοῦ λέγοντες εὕρηνται οἱ πέντε βασιλεῖς κεκρυμμένοι ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ τῷ ἐν Μακηδα
18 καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς κυλίσατε λίθους ἐπὶ τὸ στόμα τοῦ σπηλαίου καὶ καταστήσατε ἄνδρας φυλάσσειν ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
19 ὑμεῖς δὲ μὴ ἑστήκατε καταδιώκοντες ὀπίσω τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν καὶ καταλάβετε τὴν οὐραγίαν αὐτῶν καὶ μὴ ἀφῆτε εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν παρέδωκεν γὰρ αὐτοὺς κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ἡμῶν
20 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς κατέπαυσεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς υἱὸς Ισραηλ κόπτοντες αὐτοὺς κοπὴν μεγάλην σφόδρα ἕως εἰς τέλος καὶ οἱ διασῳζόμενοι διεσώθησαν εἰς τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὀχυράς
21 καὶ ἀπεστράφη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Ἰησοῦν εἰς Μακηδα ὑγιεῖς καὶ οὐκ ἔγρυξεν οὐθεὶς τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐτοῦ
22 καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς ἀνοίξατε τὸ σπήλαιον καὶ ἐξαγάγετε τοὺς πέντε βασιλεῖς τούτους ἐκ τοῦ σπηλαίου
23 καὶ ἐξηγάγοσαν τοὺς πέντε βασιλεῖς ἐκ τοῦ σπηλαίου τὸν βασιλέα Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Χεβρων καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Ιεριμουθ καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Λαχις καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Οδολλαμ
24 καὶ ἐπεὶ ἐξήγαγον αὐτοὺς πρὸς Ἰησοῦν καὶ συνεκάλεσεν Ἰησοῦς πάντα Ισραηλ καὶ τοὺς ἐναρχομένους τοῦ πολέμου τοὺς συμπορευομένους αὐτῷ λέγων αὐτοῖς προπορεύεσθε καὶ ἐπίθετε τοὺς πόδας ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τοὺς τραχήλους αὐτῶν καὶ προσελθόντες ἐπέθηκαν τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τοὺς τραχήλους αὐτῶν
25 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς μὴ φοβηθῆτε αὐτοὺς μηδὲ δειλιάσητε ἀνδρίζεσθε καὶ ἰσχύετε ὅτι οὕτως ποιήσει κύριος πᾶσι τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ὑμῶν οὓς ὑμεῖς καταπολεμεῖτε αὐτούς
26 καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἐκρέμασεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ πέντε ξύλων καὶ ἦσαν κρεμάμενοι ἐπὶ τῶν ξύλων ἕως ἑσπέρας
27 καὶ ἐγενήθη πρὸς ἡλίου δυσμὰς ἐνετείλατο Ἰησοῦς καὶ καθεῖλον αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν ξύλων καὶ ἔρριψαν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον εἰς ὃ κατεφύγοσαν ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐπεκύλισαν λίθους ἐπὶ τὸ σπήλαιον ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας

28 καὶ τὴν Μακηδα ἐλάβοσαν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ ἐφόνευσαν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσαν πᾶν ἐμπνέον ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη ἐν αὐτῇ οὐδεὶς διασεσῳσμένος καὶ διαπεφευγώς καὶ ἐποίησαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Μακηδα ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Ιεριχω
29 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐκ Μακηδα εἰς Λεβνα καὶ ἐπολιόρκει Λεβνα
30 καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτὴν κύριος εἰς χεῖρας Ισραηλ καὶ ἔλαβον αὐτὴν καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς καὶ ἐφόνευσαν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους καὶ πᾶν ἐμπνέον ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη ἐν αὐτῇ οὐδὲ εἷς διασεσῳσμένος καὶ διαπεφευγώς καὶ ἐποίησαν τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῆς ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Ιεριχω
31 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐκ Λεβνα εἰς Λαχις καὶ περιεκάθισεν αὐτὴν καὶ ἐπολιόρκει αὐτήν
32 καὶ παρέδωκεν κύριος τὴν Λαχις εἰς τὰς χεῖρας Ισραηλ καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ καὶ ἐφόνευσαν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσαν αὐτήν ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τὴν Λεβνα
33 τότε ἀνέβη Αιλαμ βασιλεὺς Γαζερ βοηθήσων τῇ Λαχις καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν Ἰησοῦς ἐν στόματι ξίφους καὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἕως τοῦ μὴ καταλειφθῆναι αὐτῶν σεσῳσμένον καὶ διαπεφευγότα
34 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐκ Λαχις εἰς Οδολλαμ καὶ περιεκάθισεν αὐτὴν καὶ ἐπολιόρκησεν αὐτήν
35 καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτὴν κύριος ἐν χειρὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ ἐφόνευσεν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους καὶ πᾶν ἐμπνέον ἐν αὐτῇ ἐφόνευσαν ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τῇ Λαχις
36 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἰς Χεβρων καὶ περιεκάθισεν αὐτήν
37 καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους καὶ πᾶν ἐμπνέον ὅσα ἦν ἐν αὐτῇ οὐκ ἦν διασεσῳσμένος ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τὴν Οδολλαμ ἐξωλέθρευσαν αὐτὴν καὶ ὅσα ἦν ἐν αὐτῇ
38 καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ εἰς Δαβιρ καὶ περικαθίσαντες αὐτὴν
39 ἔλαβον αὐτὴν καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσαν αὐτὴν καὶ πᾶν ἐμπνέον ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ οὐ κατέλιπον αὐτῇ οὐδένα διασεσῳσμένον ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τὴν Χεβρων καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῆς οὕτως ἐποίησαν τῇ Δαβιρ καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῆς

40 καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ἰησοῦς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν τῆς ὀρεινῆς καὶ τὴν Ναγεβ καὶ τὴν πεδινὴν καὶ τὴν Ασηδωθ καὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῆς οὐ κατέλιπον αὐτῶν σεσῳσμένον καὶ πᾶν ἐμπνέον ζωῆς ἐξωλέθρευσεν ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατο κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ
41 ἀπὸ Καδης Βαρνη ἕως Γάζης πᾶσαν τὴν Γοσομ ἕως τῆς Γαβαων
42 καὶ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν ἐπάταξεν Ἰησοῦς εἰς ἅπαξ ὅτι κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ συνεπολέμει τῷ Ισραηλ
