# Book of Joshua 5 (RSVCE)

### The New Generation Circumcised
1 When all the kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites that were by the sea, heard that theLordhad dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel until they had crossed over, their heart melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them, because of the people of Israel.
2 At that time theLordsaid to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the people of Israel again the second time.”
3 So Joshua made flint knives, and circumcised the people of Israel at Gibʹeath-ha-arʹaloth.
4 And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt.
5 Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people that were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
6 For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, perished, because they did not hearken to the voice of theLord; to them theLordswore that he would not let them see the land which theLordhad sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
7 So it was their children, whom he raised up in their stead, that Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.
8 When the circumcising of all the nation was done, they remained in their places in the camp till they were healed.
9 And theLordsaid to Joshua, “This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” And so the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.
### The Passover at Gilgal
10 While the people of Israel were encamped in Gilgal they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.
11 And on the morrow after the passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.
12 And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they ate of the produce of the land; and the people of Israel had manna no more, but ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
### Joshua’s Vision
13 When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood before him with his drawn sword in his hand; and Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our adversaries?”
14 And he said, “No; but as commander of the army of theLordI have now come.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, “What does my lord bid his servant?”
15 And the commander of theLord’s army said to Joshua, “Put off your shoes from your feet; for the place where you stand is holy.” And Joshua did so.


# Liber Josue 5 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Postquam ergo audierunt omnes reges Amorrhæorum, qui habitabant trans Jordanem ad occidentalem plagam, et cuncti reges Chanaan, qui propinqua possidebant magni maris loca, quod siccasset Dominus fluenta Jordanis coram filiis Israël donec transirent, dissolutum est cor eorum, et non remansit in eis spiritus, timentium introitum filiorum Israël.

2 Eo tempore ait Dominus ad Josue: Fac tibi cultros lapideos, et circumcide secundo filios Israël.
3 Fecit quod jusserat Dominus, et circumcidit filios Israël in colle præputiorum.
4 Hæc autem causa est secundæ circumcisionis: omnis populus, qui egressus est de Ægypto generis masculini, universi bellatores viri, mortui sunt in deserto per longissimos viæ circuitus,
5 qui omnes circumcisi erant. Populus autem qui natus est in deserto,
6 per quadraginta annos itineris latissimæ solitudinis incircumcisus fuit: donec consumerentur qui non audierant vocem Domini, et quibus ante juraverat ut non ostenderet eis terram lacte et melle manantem.
7 Horum filii in locum successerunt patrum, et circumcisi sunt a Josue: quia sicut nati fuerant, in præputio erant, nec eos in via aliquis circumciderat.
8 Postquam autem omnes circumcisi sunt, manserunt in eodem castrorum loco, donec sanarentur.
9 Dixitque Dominus ad Josue: Hodie abstuli opprobrium Ægypti a vobis. Vocatumque est nomen loci illius Galgala, usque in præsentem diem.

10 Manseruntque filii Israël in Galgalis, et fecerunt Phase quartadecima die mensis ad vesperum in campestribus Jericho:
11 et comederunt de frugibus terræ die altero, azymos panes, et polentam ejusdem anni.
12 Defecitque manna postquam comederunt de frugibus terræ, nec usi sunt ultra cibo illo filii Israël, sed comederunt de frugibus præsentis anni terræ Chanaan.

13 Cum autem esset Josue in agro urbis Jericho, levavit oculos, et vidit virum stantem contra se, evaginatum tenentem gladium: perrexitque ad eum, et ait: Noster es, an adversariorum?
14 Qui respondit: Nequaquam: sed sum princeps exercitus Domini, et nunc venio.
15 Cecidit Josue pronus in terram, et adorans ait: Quid dominus meus loquitur ad servum suum?
16 Solve, inquit, calceamentum tuum de pedibus tuis: locus enim, in quo stas, sanctus est. Fecitque Josue ut sibi fuerat imperatum.


# Ἰησοῦς Nαυῆ 5 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν Αμορραίων οἳ ἦσαν πέραν τοῦ Ιορδάνου καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς Φοινίκης οἱ παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν ὅτι ἀπεξήρανεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς τὸν Ιορδάνην ποταμὸν ἐκ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ ἐν τῷ διαβαίνειν αὐτούς καὶ ἐτάκησαν αὐτῶν αἱ διάνοιαι καὶ κατεπλάγησαν καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς φρόνησις οὐδεμία ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ

2 ὑπὸ δὲ τοῦτον τὸν καιρὸν εἶπεν κύριος τῷ Ἰησοῖ ποίησον σεαυτῷ μαχαίρας πετρίνας ἐκ πέτρας ἀκροτόμου καὶ καθίσας περίτεμε τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ
3 καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἰησοῦς μαχαίρας πετρίνας ἀκροτόμους καὶ περιέτεμεν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ ἐπὶ τοῦ καλουμένου τόπου Βουνὸς τῶν ἀκροβυστιῶν
4 ὃν δὲ τρόπον περιεκάθαρεν Ἰησοῦς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ ὅσοι ποτὲ ἐγένοντο ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ὅσοι ποτὲ ἀπερίτμητοι ἦσαν τῶν ἐξεληλυθότων ἐξ Αἰγύπτου
5 πάντας τούτους περιέτεμεν Ἰησοῦς
6 τεσσαράκοντα γὰρ καὶ δύο ἔτη ἀνέστραπται Ισραηλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τῇ Μαδβαρίτιδι διὸ ἀπερίτμητοι ἦσαν οἱ πλεῖστοι αὐτῶν τῶν μαχίμων τῶν ἐξεληλυθότων ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου οἱ ἀπειθήσαντες τῶν ἐντολῶν τοῦ θεοῦ οἷς καὶ διώρισεν μὴ ἰδεῖν αὐτοὺς τὴν γῆν ἣν ὤμοσεν κύριος τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν δοῦναι ἡμῖν γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι
7 ἀντὶ δὲ τούτων ἀντικατέστησεν τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν οὓς Ἰησοῦς περιέτεμεν διὰ τὸ αὐτοὺς γεγενῆσθαι κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἀπεριτμήτους
8 περιτμηθέντες δὲ ἡσυχίαν εἶχον αὐτόθι καθήμενοι ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ ἕως ὑγιάσθησαν
9 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος τῷ Ἰησοῖ υἱῷ Ναυη ἐν τῇ σήμερον ἡμέρᾳ ἀφεῖλον τὸν ὀνειδισμὸν Αἰγύπτου ἀ{F'} ὑμῶν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου Γαλγαλα

10 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τὸ πασχα τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς ἀπὸ ἑσπέρας ἐπὶ δυσμῶν Ιεριχω ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ιορδάνου ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ
11 καὶ ἐφάγοσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ σίτου τῆς γῆς ἄζυμα καὶ νέα ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
12 ἐξέλιπεν τὸ μαννα μετὰ τὸ βεβρωκέναι αὐτοὺς ἐκ τοῦ σίτου τῆς γῆς καὶ οὐκέτι ὑπῆρχεν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ μαννα ἐκαρπίσαντο δὲ τὴν χώραν τῶν Φοινίκων ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ

13 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἦν Ἰησοῦς ἐν Ιεριχω καὶ ἀναβλέψας τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς εἶδεν ἄνθρωπον ἑστηκότα ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ ῥομφαία ἐσπασμένη ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ προσελθὼν Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἡμέτερος εἶ ἢ τῶν ὑπεναντίων
14 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἐγὼ ἀρχιστράτηγος δυνάμεως κυρίου νυνὶ παραγέγονα
15 καὶ Ἰησοῦς ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ δέσποτα τί προστάσσεις τῷ σῷ οἰκέτῃ
16 καὶ λέγει ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος κυρίου πρὸς Ἰησοῦν λῦσαι τὸ ὑπόδημα ἐκ τῶν ποδῶν σου ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐ{F'} ᾧ σὺ ἕστηκας ἅγιός ἐστιν
