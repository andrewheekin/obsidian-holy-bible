# Book of Joshua 2 (RSVCE)

### Spies Sent to Jericho
1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” And they went, and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lodged there.
2 And it was told the king of Jericho, “Behold, certain men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land.”
3 Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring forth the men that have come to you, who entered your house; for they have come to search out all the land.”
4 But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them; and she said, “True, men came to me, but I did not know where they came from;
5 and when the gate was to be closed, at dark, the men went out; where the men went I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them.”
6 But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof.
7 So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords; and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.
8 Before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,
9 and said to the men, “I know that theLordhas given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
10 For we have heard how theLorddried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
11 And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no courage left in any man, because of you; for theLordyour God is he who is God in heaven above and on earth beneath.
12 Now then, swear to me by theLordthat as I have dealt kindly with you, you also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a sure sign,
13 and save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.”
14 And the men said to her, “Our life for yours! If you do not tell this business of ours, then we will deal kindly and faithfully with you when theLordgives us the land.”
15 Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall, so that she dwelt in the wall.
16 And she said to them, “Go into the hills, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned; then afterward you may go your way.”
17 The men said to her, “We will be guiltless with respect to this oath of yours which you have made us swear.
18 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down; and you shall gather into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household.
19 If any one goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless; but if a hand is laid upon any one who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head.
20 But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless with respect to your oath which you have made us swear.”
21 And she said, “According to your words, so be it.” Then she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet cord in the window.
22 They departed, and went into the hills, and remained there three days, until the pursuers returned; for the pursuers had made search all along the way and found nothing.
23 Then the two men came down again from the hills, and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.
24 And they said to Joshua, “Truly theLordhas given all the land into our hands; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of us.”


# Liber Josue 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Misit igitur Josue filius Nun de Setim duos viros exploratores in abscondito: et dixit eis: Ite, et considerate terram, urbemque Jericho. Qui pergentes ingressi sunt domum mulieris meretricis, nomine Rahab, et quieverunt apud eam.
2 Nuntiatumque est regi Jericho, et dictum: Ecce viri ingressi sunt huc per noctem de filiis Israël, ut explorarent terram.
3 Misitque rex Jericho ad Rahab, dicens: Educ viros, qui venerunt ad te, et ingressi sunt domum tuam: exploratores quippe sunt, et omnem terram considerare venerunt.
4 Tollensque mulier viros, abscondit, et ait: Fateor, venerunt ad me, sed nesciebam unde essent:
5 cumque porta clauderetur in tenebris, et illi pariter exierunt; nescio quo abierunt: persequimini cito, et comprehendetis eos.
6 Ipsa autem fecit ascendere viros in solarium domus suæ, operuitque eos stipula lini, quæ ibi erat.
7 Hi autem, qui missi fuerant, secuti sunt eos per viam, quæ ducit ad vadum Jordanis: illisque egressis statim porta clausa est.

8 Necdum obdormierant qui latebant, et ecce mulier ascendit ad eos, et ait:
9 Novi quod Dominus tradiderit vobis terram: etenim irruit in nos terror vester, et elanguerunt omnes habitatores terræ.
10 Audivimus quod siccaverit Dominus aquas maris Rubri ad vestrum introitum, quando egressi estis ex Ægypto: et quæ feceritis duobus Amorrhæorum regibus, qui erant trans Jordanem, Sehon et Og, quos interfecistis.
11 Et hæc audientes pertimuimus, et elanguit cor nostrum, nec remansit in nobis spiritus ad introitum vestrum: Dominus enim Deus vester ipse est Deus in cælo sursum et in terra deorsum.
12 Nunc ergo jurate mihi per Dominum, ut quomodo ego misericordiam feci vobiscum, ita et vos faciatis cum domo patris mei: detisque mihi verum signum,
13 ut salvetis patrem meum et matrem, et fratres ac sorores meas, et omnia quæ illorum sunt, et eruatis animas nostras a morte.
14 Qui responderunt ei: Anima nostra sit pro vobis in mortem, si tamen non prodideris nos: cumque tradiderit nobis Dominus terram, faciemus in te misericordiam et veritatem.
15 Demisit ergo eos per funem de fenestra: domus enim ejus hærebat muro.
16 Dixitque ad eos: Ad montana conscendite, ne forte occurrant vobis revertentes: ibique latitate tribus diebus, donec redeant, et sic ibitis per viam vestram.

17 Qui dixerunt ad eam: Innoxii erimus a juramento hoc, quo adjurasti nos:
18 si ingredientibus nobis terram, signum fuerit funiculus iste coccineus, et ligaveris eum in fenestra, per quam demisisti nos: et patrem tuum ac matrem, fratresque et omnem cognationem tuam congregaveris in domum tuam.
19 Qui ostium domus tuæ egressus fuerit, sanguis ipsius erit in caput ejus, et nos erimus alieni. Cunctorum autem sanguis, qui tecum in domo fuerint, redundabit in caput nostrum, si eos aliquis tetigerit.
20 Quod si nos prodere volueris, et sermonem istum proferre in medium, erimus mundi ab hoc juramento, quo adjurasti nos.
21 Et illa respondit: Sicut locuti estis, ita fiat: dimittensque eos ut pergerent, appendit funiculum coccineum in fenestra.

22 Illi vero ambulantes pervenerunt ad montana, et manserunt ibi tres dies, donec reverterentur qui fuerant persecuti: quærentes enim per omnem viam, non repererunt eos.
23 Quibus urbem ingressis, reversi sunt, et descenderunt exploratores de monte: et, transmisso Jordane, venerunt ad Josue filium Nun, narraveruntque ei omnia quæ acciderant sibi,
24 atque dixerunt: Tradidit Dominus omnem terram hanc in manus nostras, et timore prostrati sunt cuncti habitatores ejus.


# Ἰησοῦς Nαυῆ 2 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυη ἐκ Σαττιν δύο νεανίσκους κατασκοπεῦσαι λέγων ἀνάβητε καὶ ἴδετε τὴν γῆν καὶ τὴν Ιεριχω καὶ πορευθέντες εἰσήλθοσαν οἱ δύο νεανίσκοι εἰς Ιεριχω καὶ εἰσήλθοσαν εἰς οἰκίαν γυναικὸς πόρνης ᾗ ὄνομα Ρααβ καὶ κατέλυσαν ἐκεῖ
2 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ βασιλεῖ Ιεριχω λέγοντες εἰσπεπόρευνται ὧδε ἄνδρες τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ κατασκοπεῦσαι τὴν γῆν
3 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ιεριχω καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Ρααβ λέγων ἐξάγαγε τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς εἰσπεπορευμένους εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν σου τὴν νύκτα κατασκοπεῦσαι γὰρ τὴν γῆν ἥκασιν
4 καὶ λαβοῦσα ἡ γυνὴ τοὺς ἄνδρας ἔκρυψεν αὐτοὺς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς λέγουσα εἰσεληλύθασιν πρός με οἱ ἄνδρες
5 ὡς δὲ ἡ πύλη ἐκλείετο ἐν τῷ σκότει καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες ἐξῆλθον οὐκ ἐπίσταμαι ποῦ πεπόρευνται καταδιώξατε ὀπίσω αὐτῶν εἰ καταλήμψεσθε αὐτούς
6 αὐτὴ δὲ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα καὶ ἔκρυψεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ λινοκαλάμῃ τῇ ἐστοιβασμένῃ αὐτῇ ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος
7 καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες κατεδίωξαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ὁδὸν τὴν ἐπὶ τοῦ Ιορδάνου ἐπὶ τὰς διαβάσεις καὶ ἡ πύλη ἐκλείσθη καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξήλθοσαν οἱ διώκοντες ὀπίσω αὐτῶν

8 καὶ αὐτοὶ δὲ πρὶν ἢ κοιμηθῆναι αὐτούς καὶ αὐτὴ ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα πρὸς αὐτοὺς
9 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς ἐπίσταμαι ὅτι δέδωκεν ὑμῖν κύριος τὴν γῆν ἐπιπέπτωκεν γὰρ ὁ φόβος ὑμῶν ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς
10 ἀκηκόαμεν γὰρ ὅτι κατεξήρανεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς τὴν ἐρυθρὰν θάλασσαν ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν ὅτε ἐξεπορεύεσθε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου καὶ ὅσα ἐποίησεν τοῖς δυσὶ βασιλεῦσιν τῶν Αμορραίων οἳ ἦσαν πέραν τοῦ Ιορδάνου τῷ Σηων καὶ Ωγ οὓς ἐξωλεθρεύσατε αὐτούς
11 καὶ ἀκούσαντες ἡμεῖς ἐξέστημεν τῇ καρδίᾳ ἡμῶν καὶ οὐκ ἔστη ἔτι πνεῦμα ἐν οὐδενὶ ἡμῶν ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν ὅτι κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν θεὸς ἐν οὐρανῷ ἄνω καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κάτω
12 καὶ νῦν ὀμόσατέ μοι κύριον τὸν θεόν ὅτι ποιῶ ὑμῖν ἔλεος καὶ ποιήσετε καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔλεος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός μου
13 καὶ ζωγρήσετε τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου καὶ τὴν μητέρα μου καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφούς μου καὶ πάντα τὸν οἶκόν μου καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐξελεῖσθε τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐκ θανάτου
14 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ οἱ ἄνδρες ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν ἀν{Q'} ὑμῶν εἰς θάνατον καὶ αὐτὴ εἶπεν ὡς ἂν παραδῷ κύριος ὑμῖν τὴν πόλιν ποιήσετε εἰς ἐμὲ ἔλεος καὶ ἀλήθειαν
15 καὶ κατεχάλασεν αὐτοὺς διὰ τῆς θυρίδος
16 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς εἰς τὴν ὀρεινὴν ἀπέλθετε μὴ συναντήσωσιν ὑμῖν οἱ καταδιώκοντες καὶ κρυβήσεσθε ἐκεῖ τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἕως ἂν ἀποστρέψωσιν οἱ καταδιώκοντες ὀπίσω ὑμῶν καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπελεύσεσθε εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ὑμῶν

17 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄνδρες πρὸς αὐτήν ἀθῷοί ἐσμεν τῷ ὅρκῳ σου τούτῳ
18 ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς εἰσπορευόμεθα εἰς μέρος τῆς πόλεως καὶ θήσεις τὸ σημεῖον τὸ σπαρτίον τὸ κόκκινον τοῦτο ἐκδήσεις εἰς τὴν θυρίδα δ{I'} ἧς κατεβίβασας ἡμᾶς δ{I'} αὐτῆς τὸν δὲ πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα σου καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου καὶ πάντα τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός σου συνάξεις πρὸς σεαυτὴν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν σου
19 καὶ ἔσται πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐξέλθῃ τὴν θύραν τῆς οἰκίας σου ἔξω ἔνοχος ἑαυτῷ ἔσται ἡμεῖς δὲ ἀθῷοι τῷ ὅρκῳ σου τούτῳ καὶ ὅσοι ἐὰν γένωνται μετὰ σοῦ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ σου ἡμεῖς ἔνοχοι ἐσόμεθα
20 ἐὰν δέ τις ἡμᾶς ἀδικήσῃ ἢ καὶ ἀποκαλύψῃ τοὺς λόγους ἡμῶν τούτους ἐσόμεθα ἀθῷοι τῷ ὅρκῳ σου τούτῳ
21 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα ὑμῶν οὕτως ἔστω καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτούς

22 καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν καὶ ἤλθοσαν εἰς τὴν ὀρεινὴν καὶ κατέμειναν ἐκεῖ τρεῖς ἡμέρας καὶ ἐξεζήτησαν οἱ καταδιώκοντες πάσας τὰς ὁδοὺς καὶ οὐχ εὕροσαν
23 καὶ ὑπέστρεψαν οἱ δύο νεανίσκοι καὶ κατέβησαν ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους καὶ διέβησαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν υἱὸν Ναυη καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ συμβεβηκότα αὐτοῖς
24 καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν ὅτι παρέδωκεν κύριος πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἐν χειρὶ ἡμῶν καὶ κατέπτηκεν πᾶς ὁ κατοικῶν τὴν γῆν ἐκείνην ἀ{F'} ἡμῶν
