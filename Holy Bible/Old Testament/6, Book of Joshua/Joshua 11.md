# Book of Joshua 11 (RSVCE)

### The United Kings of Northern Canaan Defeated
1 When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achʹshaph,
2 and to the kings who were in the northern hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinʹneroth, and in the lowland, and in Naphoth-dor on the west,
3 to the Canaanites in the east and the west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perʹizzites, and the Jebʹusites in the hill country, and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
4 And they came out, with all their troops, a great host, in number like the sand that is upon the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.
5 And all these kings joined their forces, and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
6 And theLordsaid to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for tomorrow at this time I will give over all of them, slain, to Israel; you shall hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.”
7 So Joshua came suddenly upon them with all his people of war, by the waters of Merom, and fell upon them.
8 And theLordgave them into the hand of Israel, who smote them and chased them as far as Great Sidon and Misʹrephoth-maʹim, and eastward as far as the valley of Mizpeh; and they smote them, until they left none remaining.
9 And Joshua did to them as theLordbade him; he hamstrung their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.
10 And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote its king with the sword; for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms.
11 And they put to the sword all who were in it, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed, and he burned Hazor with fire.
12 And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took, and smote them with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them, as Moses the servant of theLordhad commanded.
13 But none of the cities that stood on mounds did Israel burn, except Hazor only; that Joshua burned.
14 And all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the people of Israel took for their booty; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave any that breathed.
15 As theLordhad commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that theLordhad commanded Moses.
### Summary of Joshua’s Conquests
16 So Joshua took all that land, the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland
17 from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seʹir, as far as Baʹal-gad in the valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. And he took all their kings, and smote them, and put them to death.
18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
19 There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; they took all in battle.
20 For it was theLord’s doing to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, in order that they should be utterly destroyed, and should receive no mercy but be exterminated, as theLordcommanded Moses.
21 And Joshua came at that time, and wiped out the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
22 There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the people of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.
23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that theLordhad spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal allotments. And the land had rest from war.


# Liber Josue 11 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Quæ cum audisset Jabin rex Asor, misit ad Jobab regem Madon, et ad regem Semeron, atque ad regem Achsaph:
2 ad reges quoque aquilonis, qui habitabant in montanis et in planitie contra meridiem Ceneroth, in campestribus quoque et in regionibus Dor juxta mare:
3 Chananæum quoque ab oriente et occidente, et Amorrhæum atque Hethæum ac Pherezæum et Jebusæum in montanis: Hevæum quoque qui habitabat ad radices Hermon in terra Maspha.
4 Egressique sunt omnes cum turmis suis, populus multus nimis sicut arena quæ est in littore maris, equi quoque et currus immensæ multitudinis.
5 Conveneruntque omnes reges isti in unum ad aquas Merom, ut pugnarent contra Israël.

6 Dixitque Dominus ad Josue: Ne timeas eos: cras enim hac eadem hora ego tradam omnes istos vulnerandos in conspectu Israël: equos eorum subnervabis, et currus igne combures.
7 Venitque Josue, et omnis exercitus cum eo, adversus illos ad aquas Merom subito, et irruerunt super eos,
8 tradiditque illos Dominus in manus Israël. Qui percusserunt eos, et persecuti sunt usque ad Sidonem magnam, et aquas Maserephoth, campumque Masphe, qui est ad orientalem illius partem. Ita percussit omnes, ut nullas dimitteret ex eis reliquias:
9 fecitque sicut præceperat ei Dominus: equos eorum subnervavit, currusque combussit igni.
10 Reversusque statim cepit Asor, et regem ejus percussit gladio. Asor enim antiquitus inter omnia regna hæc principatum tenebat.
11 Percussitque omnes animas quæ ibidem morabantur: non dimisit in ea ullas reliquias, sed usque ad internecionem universa vastavit, ipsamque urbem peremit incendio.
12 Et omnes per circuitum civitates, regesque earum, cepit, percussit atque delevit, sicut præceperat ei Moyses famulus Domini.
13 Absque urbibus, quæ erant in collibus et in tumulis sitæ, ceteras succendit Israël: unam tantum Asor munitissimam flamma consumpsit.
14 Omnemque prædam istarum urbium ac jumenta diviserunt sibi filii Israël, cunctis hominibus interfectis.
15 Sicut præceperat Dominus Moysi servo suo, ita præcepit Moyses Josue, et ille universa complevit: non præteriit de universis mandatis, nec unum quidem verbum quod jusserat Dominus Moysi.

16 Cepit itaque Josue omnem terram montanam et meridianam, terramque Gosen, et planitiem, et occidentalem plagam, montemque Israël, et campestria ejus,
17 et partem montis, quæ ascendit Seir usque Baalgad, per planitiem Libani subter montem Hermon: omnes reges eorum cepit, percussit, et occidit.
18 Multo tempore pugnavit Josue contra reges istos.
19 Non fuit civitas quæ se traderet filiis Israël, præter Hevæum, qui habitabat in Gabaon: omnes enim bellando cepit.
20 Domini enim sententia fuerat, ut indurarentur corda eorum, et pugnarent contra Israël, et caderent, et non mererentur ullam clementiam, ac perirent, sicut præceperat Dominus Moysi.

21 In illo tempore venit Josue, et interfecit Enacim de montanis, Hebron, et Dabir, et Anab, et de omni monte Juda et Israël, urbesque eorum delevit.
22 Non reliquit ullum de stirpe Enacim, in terra filiorum Israël: absque civitatibus Gaza, et Geth, et Azoto, in quibus solis relicti sunt.
23 Cepit ergo Josue omnem terram, sicut locutus est Dominus ad Moysen, et tradidit eam in possessionem filiis Israël secundum partes et tribus suas: quievitque terra a præliis.


# Ἰησοῦς Nαυῆ 11 (Septuagint)

1 ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν Ιαβιν βασιλεὺς Ασωρ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς Ιωβαβ βασιλέα Μαρρων καὶ πρὸς βασιλέα Συμοων καὶ πρὸς βασιλέα Αζιφ
2 καὶ πρὸς τοὺς βασιλεῖς τοὺς κατὰ Σιδῶνα τὴν μεγάλην εἰς τὴν ὀρεινὴν καὶ εἰς τὴν Ραβα ἀπέναντι Κενερωθ καὶ εἰς τὸ πεδίον καὶ εἰς Ναφεδδωρ
3 καὶ εἰς τοὺς παραλίους Χαναναίους ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν καὶ εἰς τοὺς παραλίους Αμορραίους καὶ Ευαίους καὶ Ιεβουσαίους καὶ Φερεζαίους τοὺς ἐν τῷ ὄρει καὶ τοὺς Χετταίους τοὺς ὑπὸ τὴν Αερμων εἰς γῆν Μασσηφα
4 καὶ ἐξῆλθον αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν με{T'} αὐτῶν ὥσπερ ἡ ἄμμος τῆς θαλάσσης τῷ πλήθει καὶ ἵπποι καὶ ἅρματα πολλὰ σφόδρα
5 καὶ συνῆλθον πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς οὗτοι καὶ παρεγένοντο ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ τοῦ ὕδατος Μαρρων πολεμῆσαι τὸν Ισραηλ

6 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν μὴ φοβηθῇς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν ὅτι αὔριον ταύτην τὴν ὥραν ἐγὼ παραδίδωμι τετροπωμένους αὐτοὺς ἐναντίον τοῦ Ισραηλ τοὺς ἵππους αὐτῶν νευροκοπήσεις καὶ τὰ ἅρματα αὐτῶν κατακαύσεις ἐν πυρί
7 καὶ ἦλθεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ πολεμιστὴς ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ Μαρρων ἐξάπινα καὶ ἐπέπεσαν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ
8 καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς κύριος ὑποχειρίους Ισραηλ καὶ κόπτοντες αὐτοὺς κατεδίωκον ἕως Σιδῶνος τῆς μεγάλης καὶ ἕως Μασερων καὶ ἕως τῶν πεδίων Μασσωχ κα{T'} ἀνατολὰς καὶ κατέκοψαν αὐτοὺς ἕως τοῦ μὴ καταλειφθῆναι αὐτῶν διασεσῳσμένον
9 καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς Ἰησοῦς ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ κύριος τοὺς ἵππους αὐτῶν ἐνευροκόπησεν καὶ τὰ ἅρματα αὐτῶν ἐνέπρησεν ἐν πυρί
10 καὶ ἀπεστράφη Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ καὶ κατελάβετο Ασωρ καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς ἦν δὲ Ασωρ τὸ πρότερον ἄρχουσα πασῶν τῶν βασιλειῶν τούτων
11 καὶ ἀπέκτειναν πᾶν ἐμπνέον ἐν αὐτῇ ἐν ξίφει καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσαν πάντας καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη ἐν αὐτῇ ἐμπνέον καὶ τὴν Ασωρ ἐνέπρησαν ἐν πυρί
12 καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τῶν βασιλέων καὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν ἔλαβεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτοὺς ἐν στόματι ξίφους καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσαν αὐτούς ὃν τρόπον συνέταξεν Μωυσῆς ὁ παῖς κυρίου
13 ἀλλὰ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τὰς κεχωματισμένας οὐκ ἐνέπρησεν Ισραηλ πλὴν Ασωρ μόνην ἐνέπρησεν Ἰησοῦς
14 καὶ πάντα τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῆς ἐπρονόμευσαν ἑαυτοῖς οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ αὐτοὺς δὲ πάντας ἐξωλέθρευσαν ἐν στόματι ξίφους ἕως ἀπώλεσεν αὐτούς οὐ κατέλιπον ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ ἓν ἐμπνέον
15 ὃν τρόπον συνέταξεν κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ τῷ παιδὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ Μωυσῆς ὡσαύτως ἐνετείλατο τῷ Ἰησοῖ καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησεν Ἰησοῦς οὐ παρέβη οὐδὲν ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν συνέταξεν αὐτῷ Μωυσῆς

16 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰησοῦς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν τὴν ὀρεινὴν καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν Ναγεβ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Γοσομ καὶ τὴν πεδινὴν καὶ τὴν πρὸς δυσμαῖς καὶ τὸ ὄρος Ισραηλ καὶ τὰ ταπεινά
17 τὰ πρὸς τῷ ὄρει ἀπὸ ὄρους Αχελ καὶ ὃ προσαναβαίνει εἰς Σηιρ καὶ ἕως Βααλγαδ καὶ τὰ πεδία τοῦ Λιβάνου ὑπὸ τὸ ὄρος τὸ Αερμων καὶ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν ἔλαβεν καὶ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν
18 καὶ πλείους ἡμέρας ἐποίησεν Ἰησοῦς πρὸς τοὺς βασιλεῖς τούτους τὸν πόλεμον
19 καὶ οὐκ ἦν πόλις ἣν οὐκ ἔλαβεν Ισραηλ πάντα ἐλάβοσαν ἐν πολέμῳ
20 ὅτι διὰ κυρίου ἐγένετο κατισχῦσαι αὐτῶν τὴν καρδίαν συναντᾶν εἰς πόλεμον πρὸς Ισραηλ ἵνα ἐξολεθρευθῶσιν ὅπως μὴ δοθῇ αὐτοῖς ἔλεος ἀλ{L'} ἵνα ἐξολεθρευθῶσιν ὃν τρόπον εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν

21 καὶ ἦλθεν Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσεν τοὺς Ενακιμ ἐκ τῆς ὀρεινῆς ἐκ Χεβρων καὶ ἐκ Δαβιρ καὶ ἐξ Αναβωθ καὶ ἐκ παντὸς γένους Ισραηλ καὶ ἐκ παντὸς ὄρους Ιουδα σὺν ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς
22 οὐ κατελείφθη τῶν Ενακιμ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ ἀλλὰ πλὴν ἐν Γάζῃ καὶ ἐν Γεθ καὶ ἐν Ασεδωθ κατελείφθη
23 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰησοῦς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν καθότι ἐνετείλατο κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς ἐν κληρονομίᾳ Ισραηλ ἐν μερισμῷ κατὰ φυλὰς αὐτῶν καὶ ἡ γῆ κατέπαυσεν πολεμουμένη
