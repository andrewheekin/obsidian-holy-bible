# Book of Joshua 8 (RSVCE)

### Ai Captured by a Stratagem and Destroyed
1 And theLordsaid to Joshua, “Do not fear or be dismayed; take all the fighting men with you, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, his city, and his land;
2 and you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king; only its spoil and its cattle you shall take as booty for yourselves; lay an ambush against the city, behind it.”
3 So Joshua arose, and all the fighting men, to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.
4 And he commanded them, “Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it; do not go very far from the city, but hold yourselves all in readiness;
5 and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach the city. And when they come out against us, as before, we shall flee before them;
6 and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, ‘They are fleeing from us, as before.’ So we will flee from them;
7 then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize the city; for theLordyour God will give it into your hand.
8 And when you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire, doing as theLordhas bidden; see, I have commanded you.”
9 So Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the place of ambush, and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people.
10 And Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, with the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
11 And all the fighting men who were with him went up, and drew near before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai.
12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
13 So they stationed the forces, the main encampment which was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley.
14 And when the king of Ai saw this he and all his people, the men of the city, made haste and went out early to the descent toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle; but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
15 And Joshua and all Israel made a pretense of being beaten before them, and fled in the direction of the wilderness.
16 So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city.
17 There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, who did not go out after Israel; they left the city open, and pursued Israel.
18 Then theLordsaid to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand.” And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
19 And the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and took it; and they made haste to set the city on fire.
20 So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they had no power to flee this way or that, for the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and smote the men of Ai.
22 And the others came forth from the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and Israel smote them, until there was left none that survived or escaped.
23 But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
24 When Israel had finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
25 And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai.
26 For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took as their booty, according to the word of theLordwhich he commanded Joshua.
28 So Joshua burned Ai, and made it for ever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day.
29 And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.
### Joshua Renews the Covenant
30 Then Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal to theLord, the God of Israel,
31 as Moses the servant of theLordhad commanded the people of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, “an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man has lifted an iron tool”; and they offered on it burnt offerings to theLord, and sacrificed peace offerings.
32 And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.
33 And all Israel, sojourner as well as homeborn, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of theLord, half of them in front of Mount Geriʹzim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of theLordhad commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.
34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them.


# Liber Josue 8 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dixit autem Dominus ad Josue: Ne timeas, neque formides: tolle tecum omnem multitudinem pugnatorum, et consurgens ascende in oppidum Hai. Ecce tradidi in manu tua regem ejus et populum, urbemque et terram.
2 Faciesque urbi Hai, et regi ejus, sicut fecisti Jericho, et regi illius: prædam vero, et omnia animantia diripietis vobis: pone insidias urbi post eam.

3 Surrexitque Josue, et omnis exercitus bellatorum cum eo, ut ascenderent in Hai: et electa triginta millia virorum fortium misit nocte,
4 præcepitque eis, dicens: Ponite insidias post civitatem, nec longius recedatis: et eritis omnes parati.
5 Ego autem, et reliqua multitudo, quæ mecum est, accedemus ex adverso contra urbem. Cumque exierint contra nos, sicut ante fecimus, fugiemus, et terga vertemus,
6 donec persequentes ab urbe longius protrahantur: putabunt enim nos fugere sicut prius.
7 Nobis ergo fugientibus, et illis persequentibus, consurgetis de insidiis, et vastabitis civitatem: tradetque eam Dominus Deus vester in manus vestras.
8 Cumque ceperitis, succendite eam, et sic omnia facietis, ut jussi.

9 Dimisitque eos, et perrexerunt ad locum insidiarum, sederuntque inter Bethel et Hai, ad occidentalem plagam urbis Hai: Josue autem nocte illa in medio mansit populi,
10 surgensque diluculo recensuit socios, et ascendit cum senioribus in fronte exercitus, vallatus auxilio pugnatorum.
11 Cumque venissent et ascendissent ex adverso civitatis, steterunt ad septentrionalem urbis plagam, inter quam et eos erat vallis media.
12 Quinque autem millia viros elegerat, et posuerat in insidiis inter Bethel et Hai ex occidentali parte ejusdem civitatis:
13 omnis vero reliquus exercitus ad aquilonem aciem dirigebat, ita ut novissimi illius multitudinis occidentalem plagam urbis attingerent. Abiit ergo Josue nocte illa, et stetit in vallis medio.

14 Quod cum vidisset rex Hai, festinavit mane, et egressus est cum omni exercitu civitatis, direxitque aciem contra desertum, ignorans quod post tergum laterent insidiæ.
15 Josue vero et omnis Israël cesserunt loco, simulantes metum, et fugientes per solitudinis viam.
16 At illi vociferantes pariter, et se mutuo cohortantes, persecuti sunt eos. Cumque recessissent a civitate,
17 et ne unus quidem in urbe Hai et Bethel remansisset qui non persequeretur Israël (sicut eruperant aperta oppida relinquentes),
18 dixit Dominus ad Josue: Leva clypeum, qui in manu tua est, contra urbem Hai, quoniam tibi tradam eam.
19 Cumque elevasset clypeum ex adverso civitatis, insidiæ, quæ latebant, surrexerunt confestim: et pergentes ad civitatem, ceperunt, et succenderunt eam.

20 Viri autem civitatis, qui persequebantur Josue, respicientes et videntes fumum urbis ad cælum usque conscendere, non potuerunt ultra huc illucque diffugere: præsertim cum hi qui simulaverant fugam, et tendebant ad solitudinem, contra persequentes fortissime restitissent.
21 Vidensque Josue et omnis Israël quod capta esset civitas, et fumus urbis ascenderet, reversus percussit viros Hai.
22 Siquidem et illi qui ceperant et succenderant civitatem, egressi ex urbe contra suos, medios hostium ferire cœperunt. Cum ergo ex utraque parte adversarii cæderentur, ita ut nullus de tanta multitudine salvaretur,
23 regem quoque urbis Hai apprehenderunt viventem, et obtulerunt Josue.
24 Igitur omnibus interfectis, qui Israëlem ad deserta tendentem fuerant persecuti, et in eodem loco gladio corruentibus, reversi filii Israël percusserunt civitatem.
25 Erant autem qui in eodem die conciderant a viro usque ad mulierem, duodecim millia hominum, omnes urbis Hai.
26 Josue vero non contraxit manum, quam in sublime porrexerat, tenens clypeum donec interficerentur omnes habitatores Hai.
27 Jumenta autem et prædam civitatis diviserunt sibi filii Israël, sicut præceperat Dominus Josue.
28 Qui succendit urbem, et fecit eam tumulum sempiternum:
29 regem quoque ejus suspendit in patibulo usque ad vesperam et solis occasum. Præcepitque Josue, et deposuerunt cadaver ejus de cruce: projeceruntque in ipso introitu civitatis, congesto super eum magno acervo lapidum, qui permanet usque in præsentem diem.

30 Tunc ædificavit Josue altare Domino Deo Israël in monte Hebal,
31 sicut præceperat Moyses famulus Domini filiis Israël, et scriptum est in volumine legis Moysi: altare vero de lapidibus impolitis, quos ferrum non tetigit: et obtulit super eo holocausta Domino, immolavitque pacificas victimas.
32 Et scripsit super lapides Deuteronomium legis Moysi, quod ille digesserat coram filiis Israël.
33 Omnis autem populus, et majores natu, ducesque ac judices, stabant ex utraque parte arcæ, in conspectu sacerdotum qui portabant arcam fœderis Domini, ut advena, ita et indigena. Media pars eorum juxta montem Garizim, et media juxta montem Hebal, sicut præceperat Moyses famulus Domini. Et primum quidem benedixit populo Israël.
34 Post hæc legit omnia verba benedictionis et maledictionis, et cuncta quæ scripta erant in legis volumine.
35 Nihil ex his quæ Moyses jusserat, reliquit intactum, sed universa replicavit coram omni multitudine Israël, mulieribus ac parvulis, et advenis qui inter eos morabantur.


# Ἰησοῦς Nαυῆ 8 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν μὴ φοβηθῇς μηδὲ δειλιάσῃς λαβὲ μετὰ σοῦ τοὺς ἄνδρας πάντας τοὺς πολεμιστὰς καὶ ἀναστὰς ἀνάβηθι εἰς Γαι ἰδοὺ δέδωκα εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου τὸν βασιλέα Γαι καὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ ποιήσεις τὴν Γαι ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησας τὴν Ιεριχω καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς καὶ τὴν προνομὴν τῶν κτηνῶν προνομεύσεις σεαυτῷ κατάστησον δὲ σεαυτῷ ἔνεδρα τῇ πόλει εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω

3 καὶ ἀνέστη Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ πολεμιστὴς ὥστε ἀναβῆναι εἰς Γαι ἐπέλεξεν δὲ Ἰησοῦς τριάκοντα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν δυνατοὺς ἐν ἰσχύι καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς νυκτός
4 καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς λέγων ὑμεῖς ἐνεδρεύσατε ὀπίσω τῆς πόλεως μὴ μακρὰν γίνεσθε ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἔσεσθε πάντες ἕτοιμοι
5 καὶ ἐγὼ καὶ πάντες οἱ με{T'} ἐμοῦ προσάξομεν πρὸς τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἂν ἐξέλθωσιν οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαι εἰς συνάντησιν ἡμῖν καθάπερ καὶ πρῴην καὶ φευξόμεθα ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν
6 καὶ ὡς ἂν ἐξέλθωσιν ὀπίσω ἡμῶν ἀποσπάσομεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐροῦσιν φεύγουσιν οὗτοι ἀπὸ προσώπου ἡμῶν ὃν τρόπον καὶ ἔμπροσθεν
7 ὑμεῖς δὲ ἐξαναστήσεσθε ἐκ τῆς ἐνέδρας καὶ πορεύσεσθε εἰς τὴν πόλιν
8 κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ποιήσετε ἰδοὺ ἐντέταλμαι ὑμῖν

9 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς τὴν ἐνέδραν καὶ ἐνεκάθισαν ἀνὰ μέσον Βαιθηλ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Γαι ἀπὸ θαλάσσης τῆς Γαι
10 καὶ ὀρθρίσας Ἰησοῦς τὸ πρωὶ ἐπεσκέψατο τὸν λαόν καὶ ἀνέβησαν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ λαοῦ ἐπὶ Γαι
11 καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ πολεμιστὴς με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἀνέβησαν καὶ πορευόμενοι ἦλθον ἐξ ἐναντίας τῆς πόλεως ἀ{P'} ἀνατολῶν
12 καὶ τὰ ἔνεδρα τῆς πόλεως ἀπὸ θαλάσσης
13

14 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδεν βασιλεὺς Γαι ἔσπευσεν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς ἐ{P'} εὐθείας εἰς τὸν πόλεμον αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς οὐκ ᾔδει ὅτι ἔνεδρα αὐτῷ ἐστιν ὀπίσω τῆς πόλεως
15 καὶ εἶδεν καὶ ἀνεχώρησεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ Ισραηλ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν
16 καὶ κατεδίωξαν ὀπίσω τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως
17 οὐ κατελείφθη οὐθεὶς ἐν τῇ Γαι ὃς οὐ κατεδίωξεν ὀπίσω Ισραηλ καὶ κατέλιπον τὴν πόλιν ἀνεῳγμένην καὶ κατεδίωξαν ὀπίσω Ισραηλ
18 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐν τῷ γαίσῳ τῷ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν εἰς γὰρ τὰς χεῖράς σου παραδέδωκα αὐτήν καὶ τὰ ἔνεδρα ἐξαναστήσονται ἐν τάχει ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν καὶ ἐξέτεινεν Ἰησοῦς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ τὸν γαῖσον ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν
19 καὶ τὰ ἔνεδρα ἐξανέστησαν ἐν τάχει ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν καὶ ἐξήλθοσαν ὅτε ἐξέτεινεν τὴν χεῖρα καὶ ἤλθοσαν ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν καὶ κατελάβοντο αὐτὴν καὶ σπεύσαντες ἐνέπρησαν τὴν πόλιν ἐν πυρί

20 καὶ περιβλέψαντες οἱ κάτοικοι Γαι εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω αὐτῶν καὶ ἐθεώρουν καπνὸν ἀναβαίνοντα ἐκ τῆς πόλεως εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν καὶ οὐκέτι εἶχον ποῦ φύγωσιν ὧδε ἢ ὧδε
21 καὶ Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ εἶδον ὅτι ἔλαβον τὰ ἔνεδρα τὴν πόλιν καὶ ὅτι ἀνέβη ὁ καπνὸς τῆς πόλεως εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν καὶ μεταβαλόμενοι ἐπάταξαν τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς Γαι
22 καὶ οὗτοι ἐξήλθοσαν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως εἰς συνάντησιν καὶ ἐγενήθησαν ἀνὰ μέσον τῆς παρεμβολῆς οὗτοι ἐντεῦθεν καὶ οὗτοι ἐντεῦθεν καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἕως τοῦ μὴ καταλειφθῆναι αὐτῶν σεσωσμένον καὶ διαπεφευγότα
23 καὶ τὸν βασιλέα τῆς Γαι συνέλαβον ζῶντα καὶ προσήγαγον αὐτὸν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν
24 καὶ ὡς ἐπαύσαντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἀποκτέννοντες πάντας τοὺς ἐν τῇ Γαι τοὺς ἐν τοῖς πεδίοις καὶ ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐπὶ τῆς καταβάσεως οὗ κατεδίωξαν αὐτοὺς ἀ{P'} αὐτῆς εἰς τέλος καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Ἰησοῦς εἰς Γαι καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας
25 καὶ ἐγενήθησαν οἱ πεσόντες ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς καὶ ἕως γυναικὸς δώδεκα χιλιάδες πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Γαι
26 
27 πλὴν τῶν κτηνῶν καὶ τῶν σκύλων τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει πάντα ἃ ἐπρονόμευσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ κατὰ πρόσταγμα κυρίου ὃν τρόπον συνέταξεν κύριος τῷ Ἰησοῖ
28 καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν Ἰησοῦς τὴν πόλιν ἐν πυρί χῶμα ἀοίκητον εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔθηκεν αὐτὴν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
29 καὶ τὸν βασιλέα τῆς Γαι ἐκρέμασεν ἐπὶ ξύλου διδύμου καὶ ἦν ἐπὶ τοῦ ξύλου ἕως ἑσπέρας καὶ ἐπιδύνοντος τοῦ ἡλίου συνέταξεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ καθείλοσαν αὐτοῦ τὸ σῶμα ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου καὶ ἔρριψαν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν βόθρον καὶ ἐπέστησαν αὐτῷ σωρὸν λίθων ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης

30 τότε ᾠκοδόμησεν Ἰησοῦς θυσιαστήριον κυρίῳ τῷ θεῷ Ισραηλ ἐν ὄρει Γαιβαλ
31 καθότι ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς ὁ θεράπων κυρίου τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ καθὰ γέγραπται ἐν τῷ νόμῳ Μωυσῆ θυσιαστήριον λίθων ὁλοκλήρων ἐ{F'} οὓς οὐκ ἐπεβλήθη σίδηρος καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν ἐκεῖ ὁλοκαυτώματα κυρίῳ καὶ θυσίαν σωτηρίου
32 καὶ ἔγραψεν Ἰησοῦς ἐπὶ τῶν λίθων τὸ δευτερονόμιον νόμον Μωυσῆ ὃν ἔγραψεν ἐνώπιον υἱῶν Ισραηλ
33 καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ δικασταὶ καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς αὐτῶν παρεπορεύοντο ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν τῆς κιβωτοῦ ἀπέναντι καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἦραν τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης κυρίου καὶ ὁ προσήλυτος καὶ ὁ αὐτόχθων οἳ ἦσαν ἥμισυ πλησίον ὄρους Γαριζιν καὶ οἳ ἦσαν ἥμισυ πλησίον ὄρους Γαιβαλ καθότι ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς ὁ θεράπων κυρίου εὐλογῆσαι τὸν λαὸν ἐν πρώτοις
34 καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα οὕτως ἀνέγνω Ἰησοῦς πάντα τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ νόμου τούτου τὰς εὐλογίας καὶ τὰς κατάρας κατὰ πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ νόμῳ Μωυσῆ
35 οὐκ ἦν ῥῆμα ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς τῷ Ἰησοῖ ὃ οὐκ ἀνέγνω Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὰ ὦτα πάσης ἐκκλησίας υἱῶν Ισραηλ τοῖς ἀνδράσιν καὶ ταῖς γυναιξὶν καὶ τοῖς παιδίοις καὶ τοῖς προσηλύτοις τοῖς προσπορευομένοις τῷ Ισραηλ
