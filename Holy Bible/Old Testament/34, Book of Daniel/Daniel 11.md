# Book of Daniel 11 (RSVCE)

1 And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
2 “And now I will show you the truth. Behold, three more kings shall arise in Persia; and a fourth shall be far richer than all of them; and when he has become strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece.
3 Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will.
4 And when he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to the dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up and go to others besides these.
5 “Then the king of the south shall be strong, but one of his princes shall be stronger than he and his dominion shall be a great dominion.
6 After some years they shall make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make peace; but she shall not retain the strength of her arm, and he and his offspring shall not endure; but she shall be given up, and her attendants, her child, and he who got possession of her.
7 “In those times a branch from her roots shall arise in his place; he shall come against the army and enter the fortress of the king of the north, and he shall deal with them and shall prevail.
8 He shall also carry off to Egypt their gods with their molten images and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and for some years he shall refrain from attacking the king of the north.
9 Then the latter shall come into the realm of the king of the south but shall return into his own land.
10 “His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on and overflow and pass through, and again shall carry the war as far as his fortress.
11 Then the king of the south, moved with anger, shall come out and fight with the king of the north; and he shall raise a great multitude, but it shall be given into his hand.
12 And when the multitude is taken, his heart shall be exalted, and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.
13 For the king of the north shall again raise a multitude, greater than the former; and after some years he shall come on with a great army and abundant supplies.
14 “In those times many shall rise against the king of the south; and the men of violence among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfil the vision; but they shall fail.
15 Then the king of the north shall come and throw up siegeworks, and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, or even his picked troops, for there shall be no strength to stand.
16 But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and all of it shall be in his power.
17 He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and he shall bring terms of peace and perform them. He shall give him the daughter of women to destroy the kingdom; but it shall not stand or be to his advantage.
18 Afterward he shall turn his face to the coastlands, and shall take many of them; but a commander shall put an end to his insolence; indeed he shall turn his insolence back upon him.
19 Then he shall turn his face back toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
20 “Then shall arise in his place one who shall send an exactor of tribute through the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days he shall be broken, neither in anger nor in battle.
21 In his place shall arise a contemptible person to whom royal majesty has not been given; he shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
22 Armies shall be utterly swept away before him and broken, and the prince of the covenant also.
23 And from the time that an alliance is made with him he shall act deceitfully; and he shall become strong with a small people.
24 Without warning he shall come into the richest parts of the province; and he shall do what neither his fathers nor his fathers’ fathers have done, scattering among them plunder, spoil, and goods. He shall devise plans against strongholds, but only for a time.
25 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall wage war with an exceedingly great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for plots shall be devised against him.
26 Even those who eat his rich food shall be his undoing; his army shall be swept away, and many shall fall down slain.
27 And as for the two kings, their minds shall be bent on mischief; they shall speak lies at the same table, but to no avail; for the end is yet to be at the time appointed.
28 And he shall return to his land with great substance, but his heart shall be set against the holy covenant. And he shall work his will, and return to his own land.
29 “At the time appointed he shall return and come into the south; but it shall not be this time as it was before.
30 For ships of Kittim shall come against him, and he shall be afraid and withdraw, and shall turn back and be enraged and take action against the holy covenant. He shall turn back and give heed to those who forsake the holy covenant.
31 Forces from him shall appear and profane the temple and fortress, and shall take away the continual burnt offering. And they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate.
32 He shall seduce with flattery those who violate the covenant; but the people who know their God shall stand firm and take action.
33 And those among the people who are wise shall make many understand, though they shall fall by sword and flame, by captivity and plunder, for some days.
34 When they fall, they shall receive a little help. And many shall join themselves to them with flattery;
35 and some of those who are wise shall fall, to refine and to cleanse them and to make them white, until the time of the end, for it is yet for the time appointed.
36 “And the king shall do according to his will; he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods. He shall prosper till the indignation is accomplished; for what is determined shall be done.
37 He shall give no heed to the gods of his fathers, or to the one beloved by women; he shall not give heed to any other god, for he shall magnify himself above all.
38 He shall honor the god of fortresses instead of these; a god whom his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.
39 He shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god; those who acknowledge him he shall magnify with honor. He shall make them rulers over many and shall divide the land for a price.
### The Time of the End
40 “At the time of the end the king of the south shall attack him; but the king of the north shall rush upon him like a whirlwind, with chariots and horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall come into countries and shall overflow and pass through.
41 He shall come into the glorious land. And tens of thousands shall fall, but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom and Moab and the main part of the Ammonites.
42 He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
43 He shall become ruler of the treasures of gold and of silver, and all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall follow in his train.
44 But tidings from the east and the north shall alarm him, and he shall go forth with great fury to exterminate and utterly destroy many.
45 And he shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, with none to help him.


# Prophetia Danielis 11 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Ego autem ab anno primo Darii Medi stabam ut confortaretur et roboraretur.
2 Et nunc veritatem annuntiabo tibi. Ecce adhuc tres reges stabunt in Perside, et quartus ditabitur opibus nimiis super omnes: et cum invaluerit divitiis suis, concitabit omnes adversum regnum Græciæ.

3 Surget vero rex fortis, et dominabitur potestate multa, et faciet quod placuerit ei.
4 Et cum steterit, conteretur regnum ejus, et dividetur in quatuor ventos cæli: sed non in posteros ejus, neque secundum potentiam illius, qua dominatus est: lacerabitur enim regnum ejus etiam in externos, exceptis his.
5 Et confortabitur rex austri: et de principibus ejus prævalebit super eum, et dominabitur ditione: multa enim dominatio ejus.
6 Et post finem annorum fœderabuntur: filiaque regis austri veniet ad regem aquilonis facere amicitiam, et non obtinebit fortitudinem brachii, nec stabit semen ejus: et tradetur ipsa, et qui adduxerunt eam adolescentes ejus, et qui confortabant eam in temporibus.
7 Et stabit de germine radicum ejus plantatio: et veniet cum exercitu, et ingredietur provinciam regis aquilonis: et abutetur eis, et obtinebit.
8 Insuper et deos eorum, et sculptilia, vasa quoque pretiosa argenti et auri, captiva ducet in Ægyptum: ipse prævalebit adversus regem aquilonis.
9 Et intrabit in regnum rex austri, et revertetur ad terram suam.

10 Filii autem ejus provocabuntur, et congregabunt multitudinem exercituum plurimorum: et veniet properans, et inundans: et revertetur, et concitabitur, et congredietur cum robore ejus.
11 Et provocatus rex austri egredietur, et pugnabit adversus regem aquilonis, et præparabit multitudinem nimiam, et dabitur multitudo in manu ejus.
12 Et capiet multitudinem, et exaltabitur cor ejus, et dejiciet multa millia, sed non prævalebit.
13 Convertetur enim rex aquilonis, et præparabit multitudinem multo majorem quam prius: et in fine temporum annorumque veniet properans cum exercitu magno, et opibus nimiis.
14 Et in temporibus illis multi consurgent adversus regem austri: filii quoque prævaricatorum populi tui extollentur ut impleant visionem, et corruent.
15 Et venit rex aquilonis, et comportabit aggerem, et capiet urbes munitissimas: et brachia austri non sustinebunt, et consurgent electi ejus ad resistendum, et non erit fortitudo.
16 Et faciet veniens super eum juxta placitum suum, et non erit qui stet contra faciem ejus: et stabit in terra inclyta, et consumetur in manu ejus.
17 Et ponet faciem suam ut veniat ad tenendum universum regnum ejus, et recta faciet cum eo: et filiam feminarum dabit ei, ut evertat illud: et non stabit, nec illius erit.
18 Et convertet faciem suam ad insulas, et capiet multas: et cessare faciet principem opprobrii sui, et opprobrium ejus convertetur in eum.
19 Et convertet faciem suam ad imperium terræ suæ, et impinget, et corruet, et non invenietur.

20 Et stabit in loco ejus vilissimus, et indignus decore regio: et in paucis diebus conteretur, non in furore, nec in prælio.
21 Et stabit in loco ejus despectus, et non tribuetur ei honor regius: et veniet clam, et obtinebit regnum in fraudulentia.
22 Et brachia pugnantis expugnabuntur a facie ejus, et conterentur: insuper et dux fœderis.
23 Et post amicitias, cum eo faciet dolum: et ascendet, et superabit in modico populo.
24 Et abundantes, et uberes urbes ingredietur: et faciet quæ non fecerunt patres ejus, et patres patrum ejus: rapinas, et prædam, et divitias eorum dissipabit, et contra firmissimas cogitationes inibit: et hoc usque ad tempus.
25 Et concitabitur fortitudo ejus, et cor ejus adversum regem austri in exercitu magno: et rex austri provocabitur ad bellum multis auxiliis, et fortibus nimis: et non stabunt, quia inibunt adversus eum consilia.
26 Et comedentes panem cum eo, conterent illum, exercitusque ejus opprimetur: et cadent interfecti plurimi.
27 Duorum quoque regum cor erit ut malefaciant, et ad mensam unam mendacium loquentur: et non proficient, quia adhuc finis in aliud tempus.
28 Et revertetur in terram suam cum opibus multis: et cor ejus adversum testamentum sanctum, et faciet, et revertetur in terram suam.
29 Statuto tempore revertetur, et veniet ad austrum: et non erit priori simile novissimum.
30 Et venient super eum trieres, et Romani: et percutietur, et revertetur, et indignabitur contra testamentum sanctuarii, et faciet: reverteturque, et cogitabit adversum eos qui dereliquerunt testamentum sanctuarii.
31 Et brachia ex eo stabunt, et polluent sanctuarium fortitudinis, et auferent juge sacrificium: et dabunt abominationem in desolationem.
32 Et impii in testamentum simulabunt fraudulenter: populus autem sciens Deum suum, obtinebit, et faciet.
33 Et docti in populo docebunt plurimos: et ruent in gladio, et in flamma, et in captivitate, et in rapina dierum.
34 Cumque corruerint, sublevabuntur auxilio parvulo: et applicabuntur eis plurimi fraudulenter.
35 Et de eruditis ruent, ut conflentur, et eligantur, et dealbentur usque ad tempus præfinitum: quia adhuc aliud tempus erit.

36 Et faciet juxta voluntatem suam rex, et elevabitur, et magnificabitur adversus omnem deum: et adversus Deum deorum loquetur magnifica, et dirigetur, donec compleatur iracundia: perpetrata quippe est definitio.
37 Et Deum patrum suorum non reputabit: et erit in concupiscentiis feminarum, nec quemquam deorum curabit, quia adversum universa consurget.
38 Deum autem Maozim in loco suo venerabitur: et deum, quem ignoraverunt patres ejus, colet auro, et argento, et lapide pretioso, rebusque pretiosis.
39 Et faciet ut muniat Maozim cum deo alieno, quem cognovit, et multiplicabit gloriam, et dabit eis potestatem in multis, et terram dividet gratuito.

40 Et in tempore præfinito præliabitur adversus eum rex austri, et quasi tempestas veniet contra illum rex aquilonis in curribus, et in equitibus, et in classe magna, et ingredietur terras, et conteret, et pertransiet.
41 Et introibit in terram gloriosam, et multæ corruent: hæ autem solæ salvabuntur de manu ejus, Edom, et Moab, et principium filiorum Ammon.
42 Et mittet manum suam in terras: et terra Ægypti non effugiet.
43 Et dominabitur thesaurorum auri, et argenti, et in omnibus pretiosis Ægypti: per Libyam quoque, et Æthiopiam transibit.
44 Et fama turbabit eum ab oriente et ab aquilone: et veniet in multitudine magna ut conterat et interficiat plurimos.
45 Et figet tabernaculum suum Apadno inter maria, super montem inclytum et sanctum: et veniet usque ad summitatem ejus, et nemo auxiliabitur ei.

1 καὶ ἐγὼ ἐν ἔτει πρώτῳ Κύρου ἔστην εἰς κράτος καὶ ἰσχύν

8 καί γε τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν μετὰ τῶν χωνευτῶν αὐτῶν πᾶν σκεῦος ἐπιθυμητὸν αὐτῶν ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου μετὰ αἰχμαλωσίας οἴσει εἰς Αἴγυπτον καὶ αὐτὸς στήσεται ὑπὲρ βασιλέα τοῦ βορρᾶ
9 καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ νότου καὶ ἀναστρέψει εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ

10 καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ συνάξουσιν ὄχλον δυνάμεων πολλῶν καὶ ἐλεύσεται ἐρχόμενος καὶ κατακλύζων καὶ παρελεύσεται καὶ καθίεται καὶ συμπροσπλακήσεται ἕως τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ
11 καὶ ἀγριανθήσεται βασιλεὺς τοῦ νότου καὶ ἐξελεύσεται καὶ πολεμήσει μετὰ βασιλέως τοῦ βορρᾶ καὶ στήσει ὄχλον πολύν καὶ παραδοθήσεται ὁ ὄχλος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ
12 καὶ λήμψεται τὸν ὄχλον καὶ ὑψωθήσεται ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ καὶ καταβαλεῖ μυριάδας καὶ οὐ κατισχύσει
13 καὶ ἐπιστρέψει βασιλεὺς τοῦ βορρᾶ καὶ ἄξει ὄχλον πολὺν ὑπὲρ τὸν πρότερον καὶ εἰς τὸ τέλος τῶν καιρῶν ἐνιαυτῶν ἐπελεύσεται εἰσόδια ἐν δυνάμει μεγάλῃ καὶ ἐν ὑπάρξει πολλῇ
14 καὶ ἐν τοῖς καιροῖς ἐκείνοις πολλοὶ ἐπαναστήσονται ἐπὶ βασιλέα τοῦ νότου καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν λοιμῶν τοῦ λαοῦ σου ἐπαρθήσονται τοῦ στῆσαι ὅρασιν καὶ ἀσθενήσουσιν
15 καὶ εἰσελεύσεται βασιλεὺς τοῦ βορρᾶ καὶ ἐκχεεῖ πρόσχωμα καὶ συλλήμψεται πόλεις ὀχυράς καὶ οἱ βραχίονες τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ νότου οὐ στήσονται καὶ ἀναστήσονται οἱ ἐκλεκτοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἰσχὺς τοῦ στῆναι
16 καὶ ποιήσει ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος πρὸς αὐτὸν κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἑστὼς κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ καὶ στήσεται ἐν γῇ τοῦ σαβι καὶ συντελεσθήσεται ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ τάξει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰσελθεῖν ἐν ἰσχύι πάσης τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ καὶ εὐθεῖα πάντα με{T'} αὐτοῦ ποιήσει καὶ θυγατέρα τῶν γυναικῶν δώσει αὐτῷ τοῦ διαφθεῖραι αὐτήν καὶ οὐ μὴ παραμείνῃ καὶ οὐκ αὐτῷ ἔσται
18 καὶ ἐπιστρέψει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰς νήσους καὶ συλλήμψεται πολλὰς καὶ καταπαύσει ἄρχοντας ὀνειδισμοῦ αὐτῶν πλὴν ὀνειδισμὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπιστρέψει αὐτῷ
19 καὶ ἐπιστρέψει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἰσχὺν τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀσθενήσει καὶ πεσεῖται καὶ οὐχ εὑρεθήσεται

20 καὶ ἀναστήσεται ἐκ τῆς ῥίζης αὐτοῦ φυτὸν βασιλείας ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτοιμασίαν αὐτοῦ παραβιβάζων πράσσων δόξαν βασιλείας καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις συντριβήσεται καὶ οὐκ ἐν προσώποις οὐδὲ ἐν πολέμῳ
21 στήσεται ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτοιμασίαν αὐτοῦ ἐξουδενώθη καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκαν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν δόξαν βασιλείας καὶ ἥξει ἐν εὐθηνίᾳ καὶ κατισχύσει βασιλείας ἐν ὀλισθρήμασιν
22 καὶ βραχίονες τοῦ κατακλύζοντος κατακλυσθήσονται ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ συντριβήσονται καὶ ἡγούμενος διαθήκης

38 καὶ θεὸν μαωζιν ἐπὶ τόπου αὐτοῦ δοξάσει καὶ θεόν ὃν οὐκ ἔγνωσαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ δοξάσει ἐν χρυσῷ καὶ ἀργύρῳ καὶ λίθῳ τιμίῳ καὶ ἐν ἐπιθυμήμασιν
39 καὶ ποιήσει τοῖς ὀχυρώμασιν τῶν καταφυγῶν μετὰ θεοῦ ἀλλοτρίου καὶ πληθυνεῖ δόξαν καὶ ὑποτάξει αὐτοῖς πολλοὺς καὶ γῆν διελεῖ ἐν δώροις

40 καὶ ἐν καιροῦ πέρατι συγκερατισθήσεται μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ νότου καὶ συναχθήσεται ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς τοῦ βορρᾶ ἐν ἅρμασιν καὶ ἐν ἱππεῦσιν καὶ ἐν ναυσὶν πολλαῖς καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν γῆν καὶ συντρίψει καὶ παρελεύσεται
41 καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν γῆν τοῦ σαβι καὶ πολλοὶ ἀσθενήσουσιν καὶ οὗτοι διασωθήσονται ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ Εδωμ καὶ Μωαβ καὶ ἀρχὴ υἱῶν Αμμων
42 καὶ ἐκτενεῖ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ γῆ Αἰγύπτου οὐκ ἔσται εἰς σωτηρίαν
43 καὶ κυριεύσει ἐν τοῖς ἀποκρύφοις τοῦ χρυσοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἀργύρου καὶ ἐν πᾶσιν ἐπιθυμητοῖς Αἰγύπτου καὶ Λιβύων καὶ Αἰθιόπων ἐν τοῖς ὀχυρώμασιν αὐτῶν
44 καὶ ἀκοαὶ καὶ σπουδαὶ ταράξουσιν αὐτὸν ἐξ ἀνατολῶν καὶ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ καὶ ἥξει ἐν θυμῷ πολλῷ τοῦ ἀφανίσαι καὶ τοῦ ἀναθεματίσαι πολλούς
45 καὶ πήξει τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ εφαδανω ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν θαλασσῶν εἰς ὄρος σαβι ἅγιον καὶ ἥξει ἕως μέρους αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ ῥυόμενος αὐτόν
