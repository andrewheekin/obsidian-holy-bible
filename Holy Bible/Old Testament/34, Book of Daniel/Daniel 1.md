# Book of Daniel 1 (RSVCE)

### Four Young Israelites at the Babylonian Court
1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiʹakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezʹzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
2 And the Lord gave Jehoiʹakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god.
3 Then the king commanded Ashʹpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family and of the nobility,
4 youths without blemish, handsome and skilful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to serve in the king’s palace, and to teach them the letters and language of the Chaldeʹans.
5 The king assigned them a daily portion of the rich food which the king ate, and of the wine which he drank. They were to be educated for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king.
6 Among these were Daniel, Hananiʹah, Mishʹa-el, and Azariʹah of the tribe of Judah.
7 And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazʹzar, Hananiʹah he called Shadrach, Mishʹa-el he called Meshach, and Azariʹah he called Abedʹnego.
8 But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king’s rich food, or with the wine which he drank; therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself.
9 And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs;
10 and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear lest my lord the king, who appointed your food and your drink, should see that you were in poorer condition than the youths who are of your own age. So you would endanger my head with the king.”
11 Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiʹah, Mishʹa-el, and Azariʹah,
12 “Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.
13 Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king’s rich food be observed by you, and according to what you see deal with your servants.”
14 So he hearkened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days.
15 At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king’s rich food.
16 So the steward took away their rich food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.
17 As for these four youths, God gave them learning and skill in all letters and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
18 At the end of the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezʹzar.
19 And the king spoke with them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiʹah, Mishʹa-el, and Azariʹah; therefore they stood before the king.
20 And in every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom.
21 And Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.


# Prophetia Danielis 1 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno tertio regni Joakim regis Juda, venit Nabuchodonosor, rex Babylonis, in Jerusalem, et obsedit eam:
2 et tradidit Dominus in manu ejus Joakim, regem Juda, et partem vasorum domus Dei: et asportavit ea in terram Sennaar in domum dei sui, et vasa intulit in domum thesauri dei sui.
3 Et ait rex Asphenez præposito eunuchorum ut introduceret de filiis Israël, et de semine regio et tyrannorum,
4 pueros in quibus nulla esset macula, decoros forma, et eruditos omni sapientia, cautos scientia, et doctos disciplina, et qui possent stare in palatio regis, ut doceret eos litteras et linguam Chaldæorum.
5 Et constituit eis rex annonam per singulos dies de cibis suis, et de vino unde bibebat ipse, ut enutriti tribus annis, postea starent in conspectu regis.

6 Fuerunt ergo inter eos de filiis Juda, Daniel, Ananias, Misaël, et Azarias.
7 Et imposuit eis præpositus eunuchorum nomina: Danieli, Baltassar; Ananiæ, Sidrach; Misaëli, Misach; et Azariæ, Abdenago.
8 Proposuit autem Daniel in corde suo ne pollueretur de mensa regis, neque de vino potus ejus: et rogavit eunuchorum præpositum ne contaminaretur.
9 Dedit autem Deus Danieli gratiam et misericordiam in conspectu principis eunuchorum.
10 Et ait princeps eunuchorum ad Danielem: Timeo ego dominum meum regem, qui constituit vobis cibum et potum: qui si viderit vultus vestros macilentiores præ ceteris adolescentibus coævis vestris, condemnabitis caput meum regi.
11 Et dixit Daniel ad Malasar, quem constituerat princeps eunuchorum super Danielem, Ananiam, Misaëlem, et Azariam:
12 Tenta nos, obsecro, servos tuos, diebus decem, et dentur nobis legumina ad vescendum, et aqua ad bibendum:
13 et contemplare vultus nostros, et vultus puerorum, qui vescuntur cibo regio: et sicut videris, facies cum servis tuis.
14 Qui, audito sermone hujuscemodi, tentavit eos diebus decem.
15 Post dies autem decem, apparuerunt vultus eorum meliores, et corpulentiores præ omnibus pueris, qui vescebantur cibo regio.
16 Porro Malasar tollebat cibaria, et vinum potus eorum: dabatque eis legumina.

17 Pueris autem his dedit Deus scientiam et disciplinam, in omni libro et sapientia: Danieli autem intelligentiam omnium visionum et somniorum.
18 Completis itaque diebus, post quos dixerat rex ut introducerentur, introduxit eos præpositus eunuchorum in conspectu Nabuchodonosor.
19 Cumque eis locutus fuisset rex, non sunt inventi tales de universis, ut Daniel, Ananias, Misaël, et Azarias: et steterunt in conspectu regis.
20 Et omne verbum sapientiæ et intellectus, quod sciscitatus est ab eis rex, invenit in eis decuplum super cunctos ariolos et magos qui erant in universo regno ejus.
21 Fuit autem Daniel usque ad annum primum Cyri regis.

1 ἐν ἔτει τρίτῳ τῆς βασιλείας Ιωακιμ βασιλέως Ιουδα ἦλθεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐπολιόρκει αὐτήν
2 καὶ ἔδωκεν κύριος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὸν Ιωακιμ βασιλέα Ιουδα καὶ ἀπὸ μέρους τῶν σκευῶν οἴκου τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὰ εἰς γῆν Σεννααρ οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ σκεύη εἰσήνεγκεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον θησαυροῦ τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ
3 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Ασφανεζ τῷ ἀρχιευνούχῳ αὐτοῦ εἰσαγαγεῖν ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας Ισραηλ καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ σπέρματος τῆς βασιλείας καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν φορθομμιν
4 νεανίσκους οἷς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς μῶμος καὶ καλοὺς τῇ ὄψει καὶ συνιέντας ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ καὶ γιγνώσκοντας γνῶσιν καὶ διανοουμένους φρόνησιν καὶ οἷς ἐστιν ἰσχὺς ἐν αὐτοῖς ἑστάναι ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ διδάξαι αὐτοὺς γράμματα καὶ γλῶσσαν Χαλδαίων
5 καὶ διέταξεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ τῆς ἡμέρας κα{Q'} ἡμέραν ἀπὸ τῆς τραπέζης τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου τοῦ πότου αὐτοῦ καὶ θρέψαι αὐτοὺς ἔτη τρία καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα στῆναι ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως

6 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ιουδα Δανιηλ καὶ Ανανιας καὶ Μισαηλ καὶ Αζαριας
7 καὶ ἐπέθηκεν αὐτοῖς ὁ ἀρχιευνοῦχος ὀνόματα τῷ Δανιηλ Βαλτασαρ καὶ τῷ Ανανια Σεδραχ καὶ τῷ Μισαηλ Μισαχ καὶ τῷ Αζαρια Αβδεναγω
8 καὶ ἔθετο Δανιηλ ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ὡς οὐ μὴ ἀλισγηθῇ ἐν τῇ τραπέζῃ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐν τῷ οἴνῳ τοῦ πότου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἠξίωσε τὸν ἀρχιευνοῦχον ὡς οὐ μὴ ἀλισγηθῇ
9 καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν Δανιηλ εἰς ἔλεον καὶ εἰς οἰκτιρμὸν ἐνώπιον τοῦ ἀρχιευνούχου
10 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀρχιευνοῦχος τῷ Δανιηλ φοβοῦμαι ἐγὼ τὸν κύριόν μου τὸν βασιλέα τὸν ἐκτάξαντα τὴν βρῶσιν ὑμῶν καὶ τὴν πόσιν ὑμῶν μήποτε ἴδῃ τὰ πρόσωπα ὑμῶν σκυθρωπὰ παρὰ τὰ παιδάρια τὰ συνήλικα ὑμῶν καὶ καταδικάσητε τὴν κεφαλήν μου τῷ βασιλεῖ
11 καὶ εἶπεν Δανιηλ πρὸς Αμελσαδ ὃν κατέστησεν ὁ ἀρχιευνοῦχος ἐπὶ Δανιηλ Ανανιαν Μισαηλ Αζαριαν
12 πείρασον δὴ τοὺς παῖδάς σου ἡμέρας δέκα καὶ δότωσαν ἡμῖν ἀπὸ τῶν σπερμάτων καὶ φαγόμεθα καὶ ὕδωρ πιόμεθα
13 καὶ ὀφθήτωσαν ἐνώπιόν σου αἱ ἰδέαι ἡμῶν καὶ αἱ ἰδέαι τῶν παιδαρίων τῶν ἐσθιόντων τὴν τράπεζαν τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ καθὼς ἂν ἴδῃς ποίησον μετὰ τῶν παίδων σου
14 καὶ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπείρασεν αὐτοὺς ἡμέρας δέκα
15 καὶ μετὰ τὸ τέλος τῶν δέκα ἡμερῶν ὡράθησαν αἱ ἰδέαι αὐτῶν ἀγαθαὶ καὶ ἰσχυραὶ ταῖς σαρξὶν ὑπὲρ τὰ παιδάρια τὰ ἐσθίοντα τὴν τράπεζαν τοῦ βασιλέως
16 καὶ ἐγένετο Αμελσαδ ἀναιρούμενος τὸ δεῖπνον αὐτῶν καὶ τὸν οἶνον τοῦ πόματος αὐτῶν καὶ ἐδίδου αὐτοῖς σπέρματα

17 καὶ τὰ παιδάρια ταῦτα οἱ τέσσαρες αὐτοί ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ὁ θεὸς σύνεσιν καὶ φρόνησιν ἐν πάσῃ γραμματικῇ καὶ σοφίᾳ καὶ Δανιηλ συνῆκεν ἐν πάσῃ ὁράσει καὶ ἐνυπνίοις
18 καὶ μετὰ τὸ τέλος τῶν ἡμερῶν ὧν εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰσαγαγεῖν αὐτούς καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ὁ ἀρχιευνοῦχος ἐναντίον Ναβουχοδονοσορ
19 καὶ ἐλάλησεν με{T'} αὐτῶν ὁ βασιλεύς καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ἐκ πάντων αὐτῶν ὅμοιοι Δανιηλ καὶ Ανανια καὶ Μισαηλ καὶ Αζαρια καὶ ἔστησαν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως
20 καὶ ἐν παντὶ ῥήματι σοφίας καὶ ἐπιστήμης ὧν ἐζήτησεν πα{R'} αὐτῶν ὁ βασιλεύς εὗρεν αὐτοὺς δεκαπλασίονας παρὰ πάντας τοὺς ἐπαοιδοὺς καὶ τοὺς μάγους τοὺς ὄντας ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ
21 καὶ ἐγένετο Δανιηλ ἕως ἔτους ἑνὸς Κύρου τοῦ βασιλέως
