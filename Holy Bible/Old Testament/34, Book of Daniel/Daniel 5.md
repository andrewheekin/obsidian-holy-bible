# Book of Daniel 5 (RSVCE)

### Belshazzar’s Feast
1 King Belshazʹzar made a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and drank wine in front of the thousand.
2 Belshazʹzar, when he tasted the wine, commanded that the vessels of gold and of silver which Nebuchadnezʹzar his father had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.
3 Then they brought in the golden and silver vessels which had been taken out of the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.
4 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
### The Writing on the Wall
5 Immediately the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace, opposite the lampstand; and the king saw the hand as it wrote.
6 Then the king’s color changed, and his thoughts alarmed him; his limbs gave way, and his knees knocked together.
7 The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeʹans, and the astrologers. The king said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”
8 Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation.
9 Then King Belshazʹzar was greatly alarmed, and his color changed; and his lords were perplexed.
10 The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banqueting hall; and the queen said, “O king, live for ever! Let not your thoughts alarm you or your color change.
11 There is in your kingdom a man in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezʹzar, your father, made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeʹans, and astrologers,
12 because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazʹzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.”
### The Writing on the Wall Interpreted
13 Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king said to Daniel, “You are that Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah.
14 I have heard of you that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you.
15 Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation; but they could not show the interpretation of the matter.
16 But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”
17 Then Daniel answered before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation.
18 O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezʹzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty;
19 and because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him; whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.
20 But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him;
21 he was driven from among men, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdom of men, and sets over it whom he will.
22 And you his son, Belshazʹzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,
23 but you have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and the vessels of his house have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know, but the God in whose hand is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not honored.
24 “Then from his presence the hand was sent, and this writing was inscribed.
25 And this is the writing that was inscribed:mene, mene, tekel,andparsin.
26 This is the interpretation of the matter:mene,God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end;
27 tekel,you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting;
28 peres,your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”
29 Then Belshazʹzar commanded, and Daniel was clothed with purple, a chain of gold was put about his neck, and proclamation was made concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
30 That very night Belshazʹzar the Chaldeʹan king was slain.
31 And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.


# Prophetia Danielis 5 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Baltassar rex fecit grande convivium optimatibus suis mille: et unusquisque secundum suam bibebat ætatem.
2 Præcepit ergo jam temulentus ut afferrentur vasa aurea et argentea, quæ asportaverat Nabuchodonosor pater ejus de templo, quod fuit in Ierusalem, ut biberent in eis rex, et optimates ejus, uxoresque ejus, et concubinæ.
3 Tunc allata sunt vasa aurea, et argentea, quæ asportaverat de templo, quod fuerat in Ierusalem: et biberunt in eis rex, et optimates ejus, uxores et concubinæ illius.
4 Bibebant vinum, et laudabant deos suos aureos et argenteos, æreos, ferreos, ligneosque et lapideos.

5 In eadem hora apparuerunt digiti, quasi manus hominis scribentis contra candelabrum in superficie parietis aulæ regiæ: et rex aspiciebat articulos manus scribentis.
6 Tunc facies regis commutata est, et cogitationes ejus conturbabant eum: et compages renum ejus solvebantur, et genua ejus ad se invicem collidebantur.
7 Exclamavit itaque rex fortiter ut introducerent magos, Chaldæos, et aruspices. Et proloquens rex ait sapientibus Babylonis: Quicumque legerit scripturam hanc, et interpretationem ejus manifestam mihi fecerit, purpura vestietur, et torquem auream habebit in collo, et tertius in regno meo erit.
8 Tunc ingressi omnes sapientes regis non potuerunt nec scripturam legere, nec interpretationem indicare regi.
9 Unde rex Baltassar satis conturbatus est, et vultus illius immutatus est; sed et optimates ejus turbabantur.

10 Regina autem pro re, quæ acciderat regi et optimatibus ejus, domum convivii ingressa est: et proloquens ait: Rex, in æternum vive! non te conturbent cogitationes tuæ, neque facies tua immutetur.
11 Est vir in regno tuo, qui spiritum deorum sanctorum habet in se, et in diebus patris tui scientia et sapientia inventæ sunt in eo: nam et rex Nabuchodonosor pater tuus principem magorum, incantatorum, Chaldæorum, et aruspicum constituit eum, pater, inquam, tuus, o rex:
12 quia spiritus amplior, et prudentia, intelligentiaque et interpretatio somniorum, et ostensio secretorum, ac solutio ligatorum inventæ sunt in eo, hoc est in Daniele: cui rex posuit nomen Baltassar. Nunc itaque Daniel vocetur, et interpretationem narrabit.

13 Igitur introductus est Daniel coram rege: ad quem præfatus rex ait: Tu es Daniel de filiis captivitatis Judæ, quem adduxit pater meus rex de Judæa?
14 audivi de te, quoniam spiritum deorum habeas, et scientia, intelligentiaque ac sapientia ampliores inventæ sunt in te.
15 Et nunc introgressi sunt in conspectu meo sapientes magi, ut scripturam hanc legerent, et interpretationem ejus indicarent mihi: et nequiverunt sensum hujus sermonis edicere.
16 Porro ego audivi de te, quod possis obscura interpretari, et ligata dissolvere: si ergo vales scripturam legere, et interpretationem ejus indicare mihi, purpura vestieris, et torquem auream circa collum tuum habebis, et tertius in regno meo princeps eris.

17 Ad quæ respondens Daniel, ait coram rege: Munera tua sint tibi, et dona domus tuæ alteri da: scripturam autem legam tibi, rex, et interpretationem ejus ostendam tibi.
18 O rex, Deus altissimus regnum et magnificentiam, gloriam et honorem dedit Nabuchodonosor patri tuo.
19 Et propter magnificentiam, quam dederat ei, universi populi, tribus, et linguæ tremebant, et metuebant eum: quos volebat, interficiebat: et quos volebat, percutiebat: et quos volebat, exaltabat: et quos volebat, humiliabat.
20 Quando autem elevatum est cor ejus, et spiritus illius obfirmatus est ad superbiam, depositus est de solio regni sui, et gloria ejus ablata est:
21 et a filiis hominum ejectus est, sed et cor ejus cum bestiis positum est, et cum onagris erat habitatio ejus: fœnum quoque ut bos comedebat, et rore cæli corpus ejus infectum est, donec cognosceret quod potestatem haberet Altissimus in regno hominum, et quemcumque voluerit, suscitabit super illud.
22 Tu quoque, filius ejus Baltassar, non humiliasti cor tuum, cum scires hæc omnia:
23 sed adversum Dominatorem cæli elevatus es: et vasa domus ejus allata sunt coram te, et tu, et optimates tui, et uxores tuæ, et concubinæ tuæ vinum bibistis in eis: deos quoque argenteos, et aureos, et æreos, ferreos, ligneosque et lapideos, qui non vident, neque audiunt, neque sentiunt, laudasti: porro Deum, qui habet flatum tuum in manu sua, et omnes vias tuas, non glorificasti.
24 Idcirco ab eo missus est articulus manus, quæ scripsit hoc quod exaratum est.
25 Hæc est autem scriptura, quæ digesta est: Mane, Thecel, Phares.
26 Et hæc est interpretatio sermonis. Mane: numeravit Deus regnum tuum, et complevit illud.
27 Thecel: appensus es in statera, et inventus es minus habens.
28 Phares: divisum est regnum tuum, et datum est Medis, et Persis.

29 Tunc, jubente rege, indutus est Daniel purpura, et circumdata est torques aurea collo ejus: et prædicatum est de eo quod haberet potestatem tertius in regno suo.
30 Eadem nocte interfectus est Baltassar rex Chaldæus.
31 Et Darius Medus successit in regnum, annos natus sexaginta duos.


# Δανιήλ 5 (Septuagint)

1 Βαλτασαρ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐποίησεν δεῖπνον μέγα τοῖς μεγιστᾶσιν αὐτοῦ χιλίοις καὶ κατέναντι τῶν χιλίων ὁ οἶνος καὶ πίνων
2 Βαλτασαρ εἶπεν ἐν τῇ γεύσει τοῦ οἴνου τοῦ ἐνεγκεῖν τὰ σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ καὶ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ ἃ ἐξήνεγκεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ τοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ πιέτωσαν ἐν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ μεγιστᾶνες αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ παλλακαὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ παράκοιτοι αὐτοῦ
3 καὶ ἠνέχθησαν τὰ σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ καὶ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ ἃ ἐξήνεγκεν ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἔπινον ἐν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ μεγιστᾶνες αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ παλλακαὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ παράκοιτοι αὐτοῦ
4 ἔπινον οἶνον καὶ ᾔνεσαν τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς χρυσοῦς καὶ ἀργυροῦς καὶ χαλκοῦς καὶ σιδηροῦς καὶ ξυλίνους καὶ λιθίνους

5 ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ ἐξῆλθον δάκτυλοι χειρὸς ἀνθρώπου καὶ ἔγραφον κατέναντι τῆς λαμπάδος ἐπὶ τὸ κονίαμα τοῦ τοίχου τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐθεώρει τοὺς ἀστραγάλους τῆς χειρὸς τῆς γραφούσης
6 τότε τοῦ βασιλέως ἡ μορφὴ ἠλλοιώθη καὶ οἱ διαλογισμοὶ αὐτοῦ συνετάρασσον αὐτόν καὶ οἱ σύνδεσμοι τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ διελύοντο καὶ τὰ γόνατα αὐτοῦ συνεκροτοῦντο
7 καὶ ἐβόησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν ἰσχύι τοῦ εἰσαγαγεῖν μάγους Χαλδαίους γαζαρηνοὺς καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς σοφοῖς Βαβυλῶνος ὃς ἂν ἀναγνῷ τὴν γραφὴν ταύτην καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν γνωρίσῃ μοι πορφύραν ἐνδύσεται καὶ ὁ μανιάκης ὁ χρυσοῦς ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ καὶ τρίτος ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου ἄρξει
8 καὶ εἰσεπορεύοντο πάντες οἱ σοφοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο τὴν γραφὴν ἀναγνῶναι οὐδὲ τὴν σύγκρισιν γνωρίσαι τῷ βασιλεῖ
9 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Βαλτασαρ πολὺ ἐταράχθη καὶ ἡ μορφὴ αὐτοῦ ἠλλοιώθη ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ καὶ οἱ μεγιστᾶνες αὐτοῦ συνεταράσσοντο

10 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἡ βασίλισσα εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πότου καὶ εἶπεν βασιλεῦ εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας ζῆθι μὴ ταρασσέτωσάν σε οἱ διαλογισμοί σου καὶ ἡ μορφή σου μὴ ἀλλοιούσθω
11 ἔστιν ἀνὴρ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ σου ἐν ᾧ πνεῦμα θεοῦ καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τοῦ πατρός σου γρηγόρησις καὶ σύνεσις εὑρέθη ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ναβουχοδονοσορ ὁ πατήρ σου ἄρχοντα ἐπαοιδῶν μάγων Χαλδαίων γαζαρηνῶν κατέστησεν αὐτόν
12 ὅτι πνεῦμα περισσὸν ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ φρόνησις καὶ σύνεσις συγκρίνων ἐνύπνια καὶ ἀναγγέλλων κρατούμενα καὶ λύων συνδέσμους Δανιηλ καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπέθηκεν αὐτῷ ὄνομα Βαλτασαρ νῦν οὖν κληθήτω καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ ἀναγγελεῖ σοι

13 τότε Δανιηλ εἰσήχθη ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Δανιηλ σὺ εἶ Δανιηλ ὁ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τῆς Ιουδαίας ἧς ἤγαγεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ πατήρ μου
14 ἤκουσα περὶ σοῦ ὅτι πνεῦμα θεοῦ ἐν σοί καὶ γρηγόρησις καὶ σύνεσις καὶ σοφία περισσὴ εὑρέθη ἐν σοί
15 καὶ νῦν εἰσῆλθον ἐνώπιόν μου οἱ σοφοί μάγοι γαζαρηνοί ἵνα τὴν γραφὴν ταύτην ἀναγνῶσιν καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτῆς γνωρίσωσίν μοι καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν ἀναγγεῖλαί μοι
16 καὶ ἐγὼ ἤκουσα περὶ σοῦ ὅτι δύνασαι κρίματα συγκρῖναι νῦν οὖν ἐὰν δυνηθῇς τὴν γραφὴν ἀναγνῶναι καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτῆς γνωρίσαι μοι πορφύραν ἐνδύσῃ καὶ ὁ μανιάκης ὁ χρυσοῦς ἔσται ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλόν σου καὶ τρίτος ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου ἄρξεις

17 τότε ἀπεκρίθη Δανιηλ καὶ εἶπεν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως τὰ δόματά σου σοὶ ἔστω καὶ τὴν δωρεὰν τῆς οἰκίας σου ἑτέρῳ δός ἐγὼ δὲ τὴν γραφὴν ἀναγνώσομαι τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτῆς γνωρίσω σοι
18 βασιλεῦ ὁ θεὸς ὁ ὕψιστος τὴν βασιλείαν καὶ τὴν μεγαλωσύνην καὶ τὴν τιμὴν καὶ τὴν δόξαν ἔδωκεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ τῷ πατρί σου
19 καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς μεγαλωσύνης ἧς ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ πάντες οἱ λαοί φυλαί γλῶσσαι ἦσαν τρέμοντες καὶ φοβούμενοι ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ οὓς ἠβούλετο αὐτὸς ἀνῄρει καὶ οὓς ἠβούλετο αὐτὸς ἔτυπτεν καὶ οὓς ἠβούλετο αὐτὸς ὕψου καὶ οὓς ἠβούλετο αὐτὸς ἐταπείνου
20 καὶ ὅτε ὑψώθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ ἐκραταιώθη τοῦ ὑπερηφανεύσασθαι κατηνέχθη ἀπὸ τοῦ θρόνου τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ τιμὴ ἀφῃρέθη ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
21 καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐξεδιώχθη καὶ ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν θηρίων ἐδόθη καὶ μετὰ ὀνάγρων ἡ κατοικία αὐτοῦ καὶ χόρτον ὡς βοῦν ἐψώμιζον αὐτόν καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δρόσου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐβάφη ἕως οὗ ἔγνω ὅτι κυριεύει ὁ θεὸς ὁ ὕψιστος τῆς βασιλείας τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ ᾧ ἂν δόξῃ δώσει αὐτήν
22 καὶ σὺ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ Βαλτασαρ οὐκ ἐταπείνωσας τὴν καρδίαν σου κατενώπιον οὗ πάντα ταῦτα ἔγνως
23 καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν κύριον θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ὑψώθης καὶ τὰ σκεύη τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ ἤνεγκαν ἐνώπιόν σου καὶ σὺ καὶ οἱ μεγιστᾶνές σου καὶ αἱ παλλακαί σου καὶ αἱ παράκοιτοί σου οἶνον ἐπίνετε ἐν αὐτοῖς καὶ τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς χρυσοῦς καὶ ἀργυροῦς καὶ χαλκοῦς καὶ σιδηροῦς καὶ ξυλίνους καὶ λιθίνους οἳ οὐ βλέπουσιν καὶ οὐκ ἀκούουσιν καὶ οὐ γινώσκουσιν ᾔνεσας καὶ τὸν θεόν οὗ ἡ πνοή σου ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ὁδοί σου αὐτὸν οὐκ ἐδόξασας
24 διὰ τοῦτο ἐκ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἀπεστάλη ἀστράγαλος χειρὸς καὶ τὴν γραφὴν ταύτην ἐνέταξεν
25 καὶ αὕτη ἡ γραφὴ ἡ ἐντεταγμένη μανη θεκελ φαρες
26 τοῦτο τὸ σύγκριμα τοῦ ῥήματος μανη ἐμέτρησεν ὁ θεὸς τὴν βασιλείαν σου καὶ ἐπλήρωσεν αὐτήν
27 θεκελ ἐστάθη ἐν ζυγῷ καὶ εὑρέθη ὑστεροῦσα
28 φαρες διῄρηται ἡ βασιλεία σου καὶ ἐδόθη Μήδοις καὶ Πέρσαις

29 καὶ εἶπεν Βαλτασαρ καὶ ἐνέδυσαν τὸν Δανιηλ πορφύραν καὶ τὸν μανιάκην τὸν χρυσοῦν περιέθηκαν περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκήρυξεν περὶ αὐτοῦ εἶναι αὐτὸν ἄρχοντα τρίτον ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ
30 ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ νυκτὶ ἀναιρέθη Βαλτασαρ ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ Χαλδαίων
31 καὶ Δαρεῖος ὁ Μῆδος παρέλαβεν τὴν βασιλείαν ὢν ἐτῶν ἑξήκοντα δύο
