# Book of Daniel 7 (RSVCE)

### Visions of the Four Beasts
1 In the first year of Belshazʹzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream, and told the sum of the matter.
2 Daniel said, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.
3 And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.
4 The first was like a lion and had eagles’ wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand upon two feet like a man; and the mind of a man was given to it.
5 And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side; it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’
6 After this I looked, and lo, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back; and the beast had four heads; and dominion was given to it.
7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrible and dreadful and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
8 I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
### Judgment before the Ancient One
9 As I looked, thrones were placed and one that was ancient of days took his seat; his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, its wheels were burning fire.
10 A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.
11 I looked then because of the sound of the great words which the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire.
12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
13 I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.
14 And to him was given dominion and glory and kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.
### Daniel’s Visions Interpreted
15 “As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was anxious and the visions of my head alarmed me.
16 I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made known to me the interpretation of the things.
17 ‘These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth.
18 But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, for ever and ever.’
19 “Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrible, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze; and which devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;
20 and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up and before which three of them fell, the horn which had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and which seemed greater than its fellows.
21 As I looked, this horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over them,
22 until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints received the kingdom.
23 “Thus he said: ‘As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces.
24 As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings.
25 He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, two times, and half a time.
26 But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end.
27 And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.’
28 “Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed; but I kept the matter in my mind.”


# Prophetia Danielis 7 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno primo Baltassar regis Babylonis, Daniel somnium vidit: visio autem capitis ejus in cubili suo: et somnium scribens, brevi sermone comprehendit: summatimque perstringens, ait:

2 Videbam in visione mea nocte: et ecce quatuor venti cæli pugnabant in mari magno.
3 Et quatuor bestiæ grandes ascendebant de mari diversæ inter se.
4 Prima quasi leæna, et alas habebat aquilæ: aspiciebam donec evulsæ sunt alæ ejus, et sublata est de terra, et super pedes quasi homo stetit; et cor hominis datum est ei.
5 Et ecce bestia alia similis urso in parte stetit: et tres ordines erant in ore ejus, et in dentibus ejus, et sic dicebant ei: Surge, comede carnes plurimas.
6 Post hæc aspiciebam, et ecce alia quasi pardus, et alas habebat quasi avis, quatuor super se: et quatuor capita erant in bestia, et potestas data est ei.
7 Post hæc aspiciebam in visione noctis, et ecce bestia quarta terribilis atque mirabilis, et fortis nimis: dentes ferreos habebat magnos, comedens atque comminuens, et reliqua pedibus suis conculcans: dissimilis autem erat ceteris bestiis quas videram ante eam, et habebat cornua decem.
8 Considerabam cornua, et ecce cornu aliud parvulum ortum est de medio eorum: et tria de cornibus primis evulsa sunt a facie ejus: et ecce oculi, quasi oculi hominis erant in cornu isto, et os loquens ingentia.

9 Aspiciebam donec throni positi sunt, et antiquus dierum sedit. Vestimentum ejus candidum quasi nix, et capilli capitis ejus quasi lana munda: thronus ejus flammæ ignis: rotæ ejus ignis accensus.
10 Fluvius igneus rapidusque egrediebatur a facie ejus. Millia millium ministrabant ei, et decies millies centena millia assistebant ei: judicium sedit, et libri aperti sunt.
11 Aspiciebam propter vocem sermonum grandium, quos cornu illud loquebatur: et vidi quoniam interfecta esset bestia, et perisset corpus ejus, et traditum esset ad comburendum igni:
12 aliarum quoque bestiarum ablata esset potestas, et tempora vitæ constituta essent eis usque ad tempus et tempus.
13 Aspiciebam ergo in visione noctis, et ecce cum nubibus cæli quasi filius hominis veniebat, et usque ad antiquum dierum pervenit: et in conspectu ejus obtulerunt eum.
14 Et dedit ei potestatem, et honorem, et regnum: et omnes populi, tribus, et linguæ ipsi servient: potestas ejus, potestas æterna, quæ non auferetur: et regnum ejus, quod non corrumpetur.

15 Horruit spiritus meus: ego Daniel territus sum in his, et visiones capitis mei conturbaverunt me.
16 Accessi ad unum de assistentibus, et veritatem quærebam ab eo de omnibus his. Qui dixit mihi interpretationem sermonum, et docuit me:
17 Hæ quatuor bestiæ magnæ, quatuor sunt regna, quæ consurgent de terra.
18 Suscipient autem regnum sancti Dei altissimi, et obtinebunt regnum usque in sæculum, et sæculum sæculorum.
19 Post hoc volui diligenter discere de bestia quarta, quæ erat dissimilis valde ab omnibus, et terribilis nimis: dentes et ungues ejus ferrei: comedebat, et comminuebat, et reliqua pedibus suis conculcabat:
20 et de cornibus decem, quæ habebat in capite, et de alio, quod ortum fuerat, ante quod ceciderant tria cornua: et de cornu illo, quod habebat oculos, et os loquens grandia, et majus erat ceteris.
21 Aspiciebam, et ecce cornu illud faciebat bellum adversus sanctos, et prævalebat eis,
22 donec venit antiquus dierum, et judicium dedit sanctis Excelsi, et tempus advenit, et regnum obtinuerunt sancti.

23 Et sic ait: Bestia quarta, regnum quartum erit in terra, quod majus erit omnibus regnis, et devorabit universam terram, et conculcabit, et comminuet eam.
24 Porro cornua decem ipsius regni, decem reges erunt: et alius consurget post eos, et ipse potentior erit prioribus, et tres reges humiliabit.
25 Et sermones contra Excelsum loquetur, et sanctos Altissimi conteret: et putabit quod possit mutare tempora, et leges: et tradentur in manu ejus usque ad tempus, et tempora, et dimidium temporis.
26 Et judicium sedebit, ut auferatur potentia, et conteratur, et dispereat usque in finem.
27 Regnum autem, et potestas, et magnitudo regni, quæ est subter omne cælum, detur populo sanctorum Altissimi: cujus regnum, regnum sempiternum est, et omnes reges servient ei, et obedient.

28 Hucusque finis verbi. Ego Daniel multum cogitationibus meis conturbabar, et facies mea mutata est in me: verbum autem in corde meo conservavi.


# Δανιήλ 7 (Septuagint)

1 ἐν ἔτει πρώτῳ Βαλτασαρ βασιλέως Χαλδαίων Δανιηλ ἐνύπνιον εἶδεν καὶ αἱ ὁράσεις τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ ἐνύπνιον ἔγραψεν

2 ἐγὼ Δανιηλ ἐθεώρουν ἐν ὁράματί μου τῆς νυκτὸς καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ τέσσαρες ἄνεμοι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ προσέβαλλον εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν μεγάλην
3 καὶ τέσσαρα θηρία μεγάλα ἀνέβαινον ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης διαφέροντα ἀλλήλων
4 τὸ πρῶτον ὡσεὶ λέαινα καὶ πτερὰ αὐτῇ ὡσεὶ ἀετοῦ ἐθεώρουν ἕως οὗ ἐξετίλη τὰ πτερὰ αὐτῆς καὶ ἐξήρθη ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐπὶ ποδῶν ἀνθρώπου ἐστάθη καὶ καρδία ἀνθρώπου ἐδόθη αὐτῇ
5 καὶ ἰδοὺ θηρίον δεύτερον ὅμοιον ἄρκῳ καὶ εἰς μέρος ἓν ἐστάθη καὶ τρία πλευρὰ ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῆς ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ὀδόντων αὐτῆς καὶ οὕτως ἔλεγον αὐτῇ ἀνάστηθι φάγε σάρκας πολλάς
6 ὀπίσω τούτου ἐθεώρουν καὶ ἰδοὺ ἕτερον θηρίον ὡσεὶ πάρδαλις καὶ αὐτῇ πτερὰ τέσσαρα πετεινοῦ ὑπεράνω αὐτῆς καὶ τέσσαρες κεφαλαὶ τῷ θηρίῳ καὶ ἐξουσία ἐδόθη αὐτῇ
7 ὀπίσω τούτου ἐθεώρουν καὶ ἰδοὺ θηρίον τέταρτον φοβερὸν καὶ ἔκθαμβον καὶ ἰσχυρὸν περισσῶς καὶ οἱ ὀδόντες αὐτοῦ σιδηροῖ μεγάλοι ἐσθίον καὶ λεπτῦνον καὶ τὰ ἐπίλοιπα τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ συνεπάτει καὶ αὐτὸ διάφορον περισσῶς παρὰ πάντα τὰ θηρία τὰ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ καὶ κέρατα δέκα αὐτῷ
8 προσενόουν τοῖς κέρασιν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἰδοὺ κέρας ἕτερον μικρὸν ἀνέβη ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν καὶ τρία κέρατα τῶν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ ἐξερριζώθη ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἰδοὺ ὀφθαλμοὶ ὡσεὶ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἀνθρώπου ἐν τῷ κέρατι τούτῳ καὶ στόμα λαλοῦν μεγάλα

9 ἐθεώρουν ἕως ὅτου θρόνοι ἐτέθησαν καὶ παλαιὸς ἡμερῶν ἐκάθητο καὶ τὸ ἔνδυμα αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ χιὼν λευκόν καὶ ἡ θρὶξ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ ἔριον καθαρόν ὁ θρόνος αὐτοῦ φλὸξ πυρός οἱ τροχοὶ αὐτοῦ πῦρ φλέγον
10 ποταμὸς πυρὸς εἷλκεν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ χίλιαι χιλιάδες ἐλειτούργουν αὐτῷ καὶ μύριαι μυριάδες παρειστήκεισαν αὐτῷ κριτήριον ἐκάθισεν καὶ βίβλοι ἠνεῴχθησαν
11 ἐθεώρουν τότε ἀπὸ φωνῆς τῶν λόγων τῶν μεγάλων ὧν τὸ κέρας ἐκεῖνο ἐλάλει ἕως ἀνῃρέθη τὸ θηρίον καὶ ἀπώλετο καὶ τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐδόθη εἰς καῦσιν πυρός
12 καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν θηρίων ἡ ἀρχὴ μετεστάθη καὶ μακρότης ζωῆς ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς ἕως καιροῦ καὶ καιροῦ
13 ἐθεώρουν ἐν ὁράματι τῆς νυκτὸς καὶ ἰδοὺ μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ὡς υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου ἐρχόμενος ἦν καὶ ἕως τοῦ παλαιοῦ τῶν ἡμερῶν ἔφθασεν καὶ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ προσηνέχθη
14 καὶ αὐτῷ ἐδόθη ἡ ἀρχὴ καὶ ἡ τιμὴ καὶ ἡ βασιλεία καὶ πάντες οἱ λαοί φυλαί γλῶσσαι αὐτῷ δουλεύσουσιν ἡ ἐξουσία αὐτοῦ ἐξουσία αἰώνιος ἥτις οὐ παρελεύσεται καὶ ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ οὐ διαφθαρήσεται

15 ἔφριξεν τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐν τῇ ἕξει μου ἐγὼ Δανιηλ καὶ αἱ ὁράσεις τῆς κεφαλῆς μου ἐτάρασσόν με
16 καὶ προσῆλθον ἑνὶ τῶν ἑστηκότων καὶ τὴν ἀκρίβειαν ἐζήτουν πα{R'} αὐτοῦ περὶ πάντων τούτων καὶ εἶπέν μοι τὴν ἀκρίβειαν καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν τῶν λόγων ἐγνώρισέν μοι
17 ταῦτα τὰ θηρία τὰ μεγάλα τὰ τέσσαρα τέσσαρες βασιλεῖαι ἀναστήσονται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αἳ ἀρθήσονται
18 καὶ παραλήμψονται τὴν βασιλείαν ἅγιοι ὑψίστου καὶ καθέξουσιν αὐτὴν ἕως αἰῶνος τῶν αἰώνων
19 καὶ ἐζήτουν ἀκριβῶς περὶ τοῦ θηρίου τοῦ τετάρτου ὅτι ἦν διάφορον παρὰ πᾶν θηρίον φοβερὸν περισσῶς οἱ ὀδόντες αὐτοῦ σιδηροῖ καὶ οἱ ὄνυχες αὐτοῦ χαλκοῖ ἐσθίον καὶ λεπτῦνον καὶ τὰ ἐπίλοιπα τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ συνεπάτει
20 καὶ περὶ τῶν κεράτων αὐτοῦ τῶν δέκα τῶν ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἑτέρου τοῦ ἀναβάντος καὶ ἐκτινάξαντος τῶν προτέρων τρία κέρας ἐκεῖνο ᾧ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ καὶ στόμα λαλοῦν μεγάλα καὶ ἡ ὅρασις αὐτοῦ μείζων τῶν λοιπῶν
21 ἐθεώρουν καὶ τὸ κέρας ἐκεῖνο ἐποίει πόλεμον μετὰ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ ἴσχυσεν πρὸς αὐτούς
22 ἕως οὗ ἦλθεν ὁ παλαιὸς τῶν ἡμερῶν καὶ τὸ κρίμα ἔδωκεν ἁγίοις ὑψίστου καὶ ὁ καιρὸς ἔφθασεν καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν κατέσχον οἱ ἅγιοι

23 καὶ εἶπεν τὸ θηρίον τὸ τέταρτον βασιλεία τετάρτη ἔσται ἐν τῇ γῇ ἥτις ὑπερέξει πάσας τὰς βασιλείας καὶ καταφάγεται πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν καὶ συμπατήσει αὐτὴν καὶ κατακόψει
24 καὶ τὰ δέκα κέρατα αὐτοῦ δέκα βασιλεῖς ἀναστήσονται καὶ ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἀναστήσεται ἕτερος ὃς ὑπεροίσει κακοῖς πάντας τοὺς ἔμπροσθεν καὶ τρεῖς βασιλεῖς ταπεινώσει
25 καὶ λόγους πρὸς τὸν ὕψιστον λαλήσει καὶ τοὺς ἁγίους ὑψίστου παλαιώσει καὶ ὑπονοήσει τοῦ ἀλλοιῶσαι καιροὺς καὶ νόμον καὶ δοθήσεται ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἕως καιροῦ καὶ καιρῶν καὶ ἥμισυ καιροῦ
26 καὶ τὸ κριτήριον καθίσει καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν μεταστήσουσιν τοῦ ἀφανίσαι καὶ τοῦ ἀπολέσαι ἕως τέλους
27 καὶ ἡ βασιλεία καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία καὶ ἡ μεγαλωσύνη τῶν βασιλέων τῶν ὑποκάτω παντὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐδόθη ἁγίοις ὑψίστου καὶ ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ βασιλεία αἰώνιος καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ἀρχαὶ αὐτῷ δουλεύσουσιν καὶ ὑπακούσονται

28 ἕως ὧδε τὸ πέρας τοῦ λόγου ἐγὼ Δανιηλ ἐπὶ πολὺ οἱ διαλογισμοί μου συνετάρασσόν με καὶ ἡ μορφή μου ἠλλοιώθη ἐ{P'} ἐμοί καὶ τὸ ῥῆμα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μου συνετήρησα
