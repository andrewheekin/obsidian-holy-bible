# Book of Daniel 8 (RSVCE)

### Vision of a Ram and a Goat
1 In the third year of the reign of King Belshazʹzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.
2 And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in Susa the capital, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was at the river Uʹlai.
3 I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the river. It had two horns; and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.
4 I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward; no beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power; he did as he pleased and magnified himself.
5 As I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
6 He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the river, and he ran at him in his mighty wrath.
7 I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns; and the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled upon him; and there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power.
8 Then the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.
9 Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land.
10 It grew great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.
11 It magnified itself, even up to the Prince of the host; and the continual burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown.
12 And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through transgression; and truth was cast down to the ground, and the horn acted and prospered.
13 Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the one that spoke, “For how long is the vision concerning the continual burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled under foot?”
14 And he said to him, “For two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state.”
### Gabriel Interprets the Vision
15 When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.
16 And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Uʹlai, and it called, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”
17 So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened and fell upon my face. But he said to me, “Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.”
18 As he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and set me on my feet.
19 He said, “Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation; for it pertains to the appointed time of the end.
20 As for the ram which you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia.
21 And the he-goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn between his eyes is the first king.
22 As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power.
23 And at the latter end of their rule, when the transgressors have reached their full measure, a king of bold countenance, one who understands riddles, shall arise.
24 His power shall be great, and he shall cause fearful destruction, and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people of the saints.
25 By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall magnify himself. Without warning he shall destroy many; and he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes; but, by no human hand, he shall be broken.
26 The vision of the evenings and the mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision, for it pertains to many days hence.”
27 And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days; then I rose and went about the king’s business; but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it.


# Prophetia Danielis 8 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno tertio regni Baltassar regis, visio apparuit mihi. Ego Daniel, post id quod videram in principio,
2 vidi in visione mea, cum essem in Susis castro, quod est in Ælam regione: vidi autem in visione esse me super portam Ulai.
3 Et levavi oculus meos, et vidi: et ecce aries unus stabat ante paludem, habens cornua excelsa, et unum excelsius altero atque succrescens. Postea
4 vidi arietem cornibus ventilantem contra occidentem, et contra aquilonem, et contra meridiem, et omnes bestiæ non poterant resistere ei, neque liberari de manu ejus: fecitque secundum voluntatem suam, et magnificatus est.

5 Et ego intelligebam: ecce autem hircus caprarum veniebat ab occidente super faciem totius terræ, et non tangebat terram: porro hircus habebat cornu insigne inter oculos suos.
6 Et venit usque ad arietem illum cornutum, quem videram stantem ante portam, et cucurrit ad eum in impetu fortitudinis suæ.
7 Cumque appropinquasset prope arietem, efferatus est in eum, et percussit arietem: et comminuit duo cornua ejus, et non poterat aries resistere ei: cumque eum misisset in terram, conculcavit, et nemo quibat liberare arietem de manu ejus.
8 Hircus autem caprarum magnus factus est nimis: cumque crevisset, fractum est cornu magnum, et orta sunt quatuor cornua subter illud per quatuor ventos cæli.

9 De uno autem ex eis egressum est cornu unum modicum: et factum est grande contra meridiem, et contra orientem, et contra fortitudinem.
10 Et magnificatum est usque ad fortitudinem cæli: et dejecit de fortitudine, et de stellis, et conculcavit eas.
11 Et usque ad principem fortitudinis magnificatum est: et ab eo tulit juge sacrificium, et dejecit locum sanctificationis ejus.
12 Robur autem datum est ei contra juge sacrificium propter peccata: et prosternetur veritas in terra, et faciet, et prosperabitur.
13 Et audivi unum de sanctis loquentem: et dixit unus sanctus alteri nescio cui loquenti: Usquequo visio, et juge sacrificium, et peccatum desolationis quæ facta est: et sanctuarium, et fortitudo conculcabitur?
14 Et dixit ei: Usque ad vesperam et mane, dies duo millia trecenti: et mundabitur sanctuarium.

15 Factum est autem cum viderem ego Daniel visionem, et quærerem intelligentiam: ecce stetit in conspectu meo quasi species viri.
16 Et audivi vocem viri inter Ulai: et clamavit, et ait: Gabriel, fac intelligere istam visionem.
17 Et venit, et stetit juxta ubi ego stabam: cumque venisset, pavens corrui in faciem meam: et ait ad me: Intellige, fili hominis, quoniam in tempore finis complebitur visio.
18 Cumque loqueretur ad me, collapsus sum pronus in terram: et tetigit me, et statuit me in gradu meo,
19 dixitque mihi: Ego ostendam tibi quæ futura sunt in novissimo maledictionis: quoniam habet tempus finem suum.
20 Aries, quem vidisti habere cornua, rex Medorum est atque Persarum.
21 Porro hircus caprarum, rex Græcorum est; et cornu grande, quod erat inter oculos ejus, ipse est rex primus.
22 Quod autem fracto illo surrexerunt quatuor pro eo: quatuor reges de gente ejus consurgent, sed non in fortitudine ejus.
23 Et post regnum eorum, cum creverint iniquitates, consurget rex impudens facie, et intelligens propositiones;
24 et roborabitur fortitudo ejus, sed non in viribus suis: et supra quam credi potest, universa vastabit, et prosperabitur, et faciet. Et interficiet robustos, et populum sanctorum
25 secundum voluntatem suam, et dirigetur dolus in manu ejus: et cor suum magnificabit, et in copia rerum omnium occidet plurimos: et contra principem principum consurget, et sine manu conteretur.
26 Et visio vespere et mane, quæ dicta est, vera est: tu ergo visionem signa, quia post multos dies erit.

27 Et ego Daniel langui, et ægrotavi per dies: cumque surrexissem, faciebam opera regis, et stupebam ad visionem, et non erat qui interpretaretur.


# Δανιήλ 8 (Septuagint)

1 ἐν ἔτει τρίτῳ τῆς βασιλείας Βαλτασαρ τοῦ βασιλέως ὅρασις ὤφθη πρός με ἐγὼ Δανιηλ μετὰ τὴν ὀφθεῖσάν μοι τὴν ἀρχήν
2 καὶ ἤμην ἐν Σούσοις τῇ βάρει ἥ ἐστιν ἐν χώρᾳ Αιλαμ καὶ εἶδον ἐν ὁράματι καὶ ἤμην ἐπὶ τοῦ Ουβαλ
3 καὶ ἦρα τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου καὶ εἶδον καὶ ἰδοὺ κριὸς εἷς ἑστηκὼς πρὸ τοῦ Ουβαλ καὶ αὐτῷ κέρατα καὶ τὰ κέρατα ὑψηλά καὶ τὸ ἓν ὑψηλότερον τοῦ ἑτέρου καὶ τὸ ὑψηλὸν ἀνέβαινεν ἐ{P'} ἐσχάτων
4 εἶδον τὸν κριὸν κερατίζοντα κατὰ θάλασσαν καὶ βορρᾶν καὶ νότον καὶ πάντα τὰ θηρία οὐ στήσονται ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐξαιρούμενος ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐποίησεν κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθη

5 καὶ ἐγὼ ἤμην συνίων καὶ ἰδοὺ τράγος αἰγῶν ἤρχετο ἀπὸ λιβὸς ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἁπτόμενος τῆς γῆς καὶ τῷ τράγῳ κέρας θεωρητὸν ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως τοῦ κριοῦ τοῦ τὰ κέρατα ἔχοντος οὗ εἶδον ἑστῶτος ἐνώπιον τοῦ Ουβαλ καὶ ἔδραμεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν ὁρμῇ τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ
7 καὶ εἶδον αὐτὸν φθάνοντα ἕως τοῦ κριοῦ καὶ ἐξηγριάνθη πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ ἔπαισεν τὸν κριὸν καὶ συνέτριψεν ἀμφότερα τὰ κέρατα αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἰσχὺς τῷ κριῷ τοῦ στῆναι ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔρριψεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ συνεπάτησεν αὐτόν καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐξαιρούμενος τὸν κριὸν ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ
8 καὶ ὁ τράγος τῶν αἰγῶν ἐμεγαλύνθη ἕως σφόδρα καὶ ἐν τῷ ἰσχῦσαι αὐτὸν συνετρίβη τὸ κέρας αὐτοῦ τὸ μέγα καὶ ἀνέβη κέρατα τέσσαρα ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ εἰς τοὺς τέσσαρας ἀνέμους τοῦ οὐρανοῦ

9 καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἑνὸς αὐτῶν ἐξῆλθεν κέρας ἓν ἰσχυρὸν καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθη περισσῶς πρὸς τὸν νότον καὶ πρὸς ἀνατολὴν καὶ πρὸς τὴν δύναμιν
10 ἐμεγαλύνθη ἕως τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἀπὸ τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἄστρων καὶ συνεπάτησεν αὐτά
11 καὶ ἕως οὗ ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος ῥύσηται τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν καὶ δ{I'} αὐτὸν θυσία ἐρράχθη καὶ ἐγενήθη καὶ κατευοδώθη αὐτῷ καὶ τὸ ἅγιον ἐρημωθήσεται
12 καὶ ἐδόθη ἐπὶ τὴν θυσίαν ἁμαρτία καὶ ἐρρίφη χαμαὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη καὶ ἐποίησεν καὶ εὐοδώθη
13 καὶ ἤκουσα ἑνὸς ἁγίου λαλοῦντος καὶ εἶπεν εἷς ἅγιος τῷ φελμουνι τῷ λαλοῦντι ἕως πότε ἡ ὅρασις στήσεται ἡ θυσία ἡ ἀρθεῖσα καὶ ἡ ἁμαρτία ἐρημώσεως ἡ δοθεῖσα καὶ τὸ ἅγιον καὶ ἡ δύναμις συμπατηθήσεται
14 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἕως ἑσπέρας καὶ πρωὶ ἡμέραι δισχίλιαι καὶ τριακόσιαι καὶ καθαρισθήσεται τὸ ἅγιον

15 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν με ἐγὼ Δανιηλ τὴν ὅρασιν καὶ ἐζήτουν σύνεσιν καὶ ἰδοὺ ἔστη ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ ὡς ὅρασις ἀνδρός
16 καὶ ἤκουσα φωνὴν ἀνδρὸς ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ Ουβαλ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν καὶ εἶπεν Γαβριηλ συνέτισον ἐκεῖνον τὴν ὅρασιν
17 καὶ ἦλθεν καὶ ἔστη ἐχόμενος τῆς στάσεώς μου καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν αὐτὸν ἐθαμβήθην καὶ πίπτω ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν μου καὶ εἶπεν πρός με σύνες υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου ἔτι γὰρ εἰς καιροῦ πέρας ἡ ὅρασις
18 καὶ ἐν τῷ λαλεῖν αὐτὸν με{T'} ἐμοῦ πίπτω ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ ἥψατό μου καὶ ἔστησέν με ἐπὶ πόδας
19 καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ γνωρίζω σοι τὰ ἐσόμενα ἐ{P'} ἐσχάτων τῆς ὀργῆς ἔτι γὰρ εἰς καιροῦ πέρας ἡ ὅρασις
20 ὁ κριός ὃν εἶδες ὁ ἔχων τὰ κέρατα βασιλεὺς Μήδων καὶ Περσῶν
21 καὶ ὁ τράγος τῶν αἰγῶν βασιλεὺς Ἑλλήνων καὶ τὸ κέρας τὸ μέγα ὃ ἦν ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ πρῶτος
22 καὶ τοῦ συντριβέντος οὗ ἔστησαν τέσσαρα ὑποκάτω κέρατα τέσσαρες βασιλεῖς ἐκ τοῦ ἔθνους αὐτοῦ ἀναστήσονται καὶ οὐκ ἐν τῇ ἰσχύι αὐτοῦ
23 καὶ ἐ{P'} ἐσχάτων τῆς βασιλείας αὐτῶν πληρουμένων τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν ἀναστήσεται βασιλεὺς ἀναιδὴς προσώπῳ καὶ συνίων προβλήματα
24 καὶ κραταιὰ ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐν τῇ ἰσχύι αὐτοῦ καὶ θαυμαστὰ διαφθερεῖ καὶ κατευθυνεῖ καὶ ποιήσει καὶ διαφθερεῖ ἰσχυροὺς καὶ λαὸν ἅγιον
25 καὶ ὁ ζυγὸς τοῦ κλοιοῦ αὐτοῦ κατευθυνεῖ δόλος ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ μεγαλυνθήσεται καὶ δόλῳ διαφθερεῖ πολλοὺς καὶ ἐπὶ ἀπωλείας πολλῶν στήσεται καὶ ὡς ᾠὰ χειρὶ συντρίψει
26 καὶ ἡ ὅρασις τῆς ἑσπέρας καὶ τῆς πρωίας τῆς ῥηθείσης ἀληθής ἐστιν καὶ σὺ σφράγισον τὴν ὅρασιν ὅτι εἰς ἡμέρας πολλάς

27 καὶ ἐγὼ Δανιηλ ἐκοιμήθην καὶ ἐμαλακίσθην ἡμέρας καὶ ἀνέστην καὶ ἐποίουν τὰ ἔργα τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐθαύμαζον τὴν ὅρασιν καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ συνίων
