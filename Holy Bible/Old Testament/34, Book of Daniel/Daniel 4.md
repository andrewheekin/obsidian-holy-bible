# Book of Daniel 4 (RSVCE)

### Nebuchadnezzar’s Second Dream
1 King Nebuchadnezʹzar to all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you!
2 It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has wrought toward me.
3 How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
4 I, Nebuchadnezʹzar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace.
5 I had a dream which made me afraid; as I lay in bed the fancies and the visions of my head alarmed me.
6 Therefore I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
7 Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeʹans, and the astrologers came in; and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its interpretation.
8 At last Daniel came in before me—he who was named Belteshazʹzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods—and I told him the dream, saying,
9 “O Belteshazʹzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is difficult for you, here is the dream which I saw; tell me its interpretation.
10 The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and its height was great.
11 The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth.
12 Its leaves were fair and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the air dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.
13 “I saw in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold, a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven.
14 He cried aloud and said thus, ‘Hew down the tree and cut off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit; let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches.
15 But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of heaven; let his lot be with the beasts in the grass of the earth;
16 let his mind be changed from a man’s, and let a beast’s mind be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.
17 The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men, and gives it to whom he will, and sets over it the lowliest of men.’
18 This dream I, King Nebuchadnezʹzar, saw. And you, O Belteshazʹzar, declare the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation, but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
### Daniel Interprets the Second Dream
19 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazʹzar, was dismayed for a moment, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, “Belteshazʹzar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you.” Belteshazʹzar answered, “My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies!
20 The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth;
21 whose leaves were fair and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all; under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the air dwelt—
22 it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.
23 And whereas the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Hew down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of heaven; and let his lot be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him’;
24 this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king,
25 that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; you shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men, and gives it to whom he will.
26 And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be sure for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules.
27 Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you; break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your tranquillity.”
### Nebuchadnezzar’s Humiliation
28 All this came upon King Nebuchadnezʹzar.
29 At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,
30 and the king said, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?”
31 While the words were still in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, “O King Nebuchadnezʹzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you,
32 and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; and you shall be made to eat grass like an ox; and seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.”
33 Immediately the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezʹzar. He was driven from among men, and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles’ feathers, and his nails were like birds’ claws.
### Nebuchadnezzar Praises God
34 At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezʹzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;
35 all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing; and he does according to his will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, “What doest thou?”
36 At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to me.
37 Now I, Nebuchadnezʹzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase.


# Prophetia Danielis 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Ego Nabuchodonosor quietus eram in domo mea, et florens in palatio meo:
2 somnium vidi, quod perterruit me: et cogitationes meæ in strato meo, et visiones capitis mei conturbaverunt me.
3 Et per me propositum est decretum ut introducerentur in conspectu meo cuncti sapientes Babylonis, et ut solutionem somnii indicarent mihi.
4 Tunc ingrediebantur arioli, magi, Chaldæi, et aruspices, et somnium narravi in conspectu eorum: et solutionem ejus non indicaverunt mihi,
5 donec collega ingressus est in conspectu meo Daniel, cui nomen Baltassar secundum nomen dei mei, qui habet spiritum deorum sanctorum in semetipso: et somnium coram ipso locutus sum.
6 Baltassar, princeps ariolorum, quoniam ego scio quod spiritum sanctorum deorum habeas in te, et omne sacramentum non est impossibile tibi: visiones somniorum meorum, quas vidi, et solutionem earum narra.

7 Visio capitis mei in cubili meo: videbam, et ecce arbor in medio terræ, et altitudo ejus nimia.
8 Magna arbor, et fortis, et proceritas ejus contingens cælum: aspectus illius erat usque ad terminos universæ terræ.
9 Folia ejus pulcherrima, et fructus ejus nimius: et esca universorum in ea. Subter eam habitabant animalia et bestiæ, et in ramis ejus conversabantur volucres cæli: et ex ea vescebatur omnis caro.
10 Videbam in visione capitis mei super stratum meum, et ecce vigil, et sanctus, de cælo descendit.
11 Clamavit fortiter, et sic ait: Succidite arborem, et præcidite ramos ejus: excutite folia ejus, et dispergite fructus ejus: fugiant bestiæ, quæ subter eam sunt, et volucres de ramis ejus.
12 Verumtamen germen radicum ejus in terra sinite, et alligetur vinculo ferreo et æreo in herbis quæ foris sunt, et rore cæli tingatur, et cum feris pars ejus in herba terræ.
13 Cor ejus ab humano commutetur, et cor feræ detur ei: et septem tempora mutentur super eum.
14 In sententia vigilum decretum est, et sermo sanctorum, et petitio: donec cognoscant viventes quoniam dominatur Excelsus in regno hominum, et cuicumque voluerit, dabit illud, et humillimum hominem constituet super eum.

15 Hoc somnium vidi ego Nabuchodonosor rex: tu ergo Baltassar interpretationem narra festinus, quia omnes sapientes regni mei non queunt solutionem edicere mihi: tu autem potes, quia spiritus deorum sanctorum in te est.

16 Tunc Daniel, cujus nomen Baltassar, cœpit intra semetipsum tacitus cogitare quasi una hora: et cogitationes ejus conturbabant eum. Respondens autem rex, ait: Baltassar, somnium et interpretatio ejus non conturbent te. Respondit Baltassar, et dixit: Domine mi, somnium his, qui te oderunt, et interpretatio ejus hostibus tuis sit.
17 Arborem, quam vidisti sublimem atque robustam, cujus altitudo pertingit ad cælum, et aspectus illius in omnem terram;
18 et rami ejus pulcherrimi, et fructus ejus nimius, et esca omnium in ea, subter eam habitantes bestiæ agri, et in ramis ejus commorantes aves cæli:
19 tu es rex, qui magnificatus es, et invaluisti: et magnitudo tua crevit, et pervenit usque ad cælum, et potestas tua in terminos universæ terræ.
20 Quod autem vidit rex vigilem, et sanctum descendere de cælo, et dicere: Succidite arborem, et dissipate illam, attamen germen radicum ejus in terra dimittite, et vinciatur ferro et ære in herbis foris, et rore cæli conspergatur, et cum feris sit pabulum ejus, donec septem tempora mutentur super eum:
21 hæc est interpretatio sententiæ Altissimi, quæ pervenit super dominum meum regem,
22 Ejicient te ab hominibus, et cum bestiis ferisque erit habitatio tua, et fœnum ut bos comedes, et rore cæli infunderis: septem quoque tempora mutabuntur super te, donec scias quod dominetur Excelsus super regnum hominum, et cuicumque voluerit, det illud.
23 Quod autem præcepit ut relinqueretur germen radicum ejus, id est arboris: regnum tuum tibi manebit postquam cognoveris potestatem esse cælestem.
24 Quam ob rem, rex, consilium meum placeat tibi, et peccata tua eleemosynis redime, et iniquitates tuas misericordiis pauperum: forsitan ignoscet delictis tuis.

25 Omnia hæc venerunt super Nabuchodonosor regem.
26 Post finem mensium duodecim, in aula Babylonis deambulabat.
27 Responditque rex, et ait: Nonne hæc est Babylon magna, quam ego ædificavi in domum regni, in robore fortitudinis meæ, et in gloria decoris mei?
28 Cumque sermo adhuc esset in ore regis, vox de cælo ruit: Tibi dicitur, Nabuchodonosor rex: Regnum tuum transibit a te,
29 et ab hominibus ejicient te, et cum bestiis et feris erit habitatio tua: fœnum quasi bos comedes, et septem tempora mutabuntur super te, donec scias quod dominetur Excelsus in regno hominum, et cuicumque voluerit, det illud.
30 Eadem hora sermo completus est super Nabuchodonosor, et ex hominibus abjectus est, et fœnum ut bos comedit, et rore cæli corpus ejus infectum est, donec capilli ejus in similitudinem aquilarum crescerent, et ungues ejus quasi avium.

31 Igitur post finem dierum, ego Nabuchodonosor oculos meos ad cælum levavi, et sensus meus redditus est mihi: et Altissimo benedixi, et viventem in sempiternum laudavi et glorificavi: quia potestas ejus potestas sempiterna, et regnum ejus in generationem et generationem.
32 Et omnes habitatores terræ apud eum in nihilum reputati sunt: juxta voluntatem enim suam facit tam in virtutibus cæli quam in habitatoribus terræ: et non est qui resistat manui ejus, et dicat ei: Quare fecisti?
33 In ipso tempore sensus meus reversus est ad me, et ad honorem regni mei, decoremque perveni: et figura mea reversa est ad me, et optimates mei et magistratus mei requisierunt me, et in regno meo restitutus sum: et magnificentia amplior addita est mihi.
34 Nunc igitur, ego Nabuchodonosor laudo, et magnifico, et glorifico regem cæli: quia omnia opera ejus vera, et viæ ejus judicia, et gradientes in superbia potest humiliare.


# Δανιήλ 4 (Septuagint)

1 ἐγὼ Ναβουχοδονοσορ εὐθηνῶν ἤμην ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου καὶ εὐθαλῶν
2 ἐνύπνιον εἶδον καὶ ἐφοβέρισέν με καὶ ἐταράχθην ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης μου καὶ αἱ ὁράσεις τῆς κεφαλῆς μου συνετάραξάν με
3 καὶ δ{I'} ἐμοῦ ἐτέθη δόγμα τοῦ εἰσαγαγεῖν ἐνώπιόν μου πάντας τοὺς σοφοὺς Βαβυλῶνος ὅπως τὴν σύγκρισιν τοῦ ἐνυπνίου γνωρίσωσίν μοι
4 καὶ εἰσεπορεύοντο οἱ ἐπαοιδοί μάγοι γαζαρηνοί Χαλδαῖοι καὶ τὸ ἐνύπνιον εἶπα ἐγὼ ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐγνώρισάν μοι
5 ἕως οὗ ἦλθεν Δανιηλ οὗ τὸ ὄνομα Βαλτασαρ κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ θεοῦ μου ὃς πνεῦμα θεοῦ ἅγιον ἐν ἑαυτῷ ἔχει καὶ τὸ ἐνύπνιον ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ εἶπα
6 Βαλτασαρ ὁ ἄρχων τῶν ἐπαοιδῶν ὃν ἐγὼ ἔγνων ὅτι πνεῦμα θεοῦ ἅγιον ἐν σοὶ καὶ πᾶν μυστήριον οὐκ ἀδυνατεῖ σε ἄκουσον τὴν ὅρασιν τοῦ ἐνυπνίου οὗ εἶδον καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ εἰπόν μοι

7 ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης μου ἐθεώρουν καὶ ἰδοὺ δένδρον ἐν μέσῳ τῆς γῆς καὶ τὸ ὕψος αὐτοῦ πολύ
8 ἐμεγαλύνθη τὸ δένδρον καὶ ἴσχυσεν καὶ τὸ ὕψος αὐτοῦ ἔφθασεν ἕως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τὸ κύτος αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰ πέρατα πάσης τῆς γῆς
9 τὰ φύλλα αὐτοῦ ὡραῖα καὶ ὁ καρπὸς αὐτοῦ πολύς καὶ τροφὴ πάντων ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ κατεσκήνουν τὰ θηρία τὰ ἄγρια καὶ ἐν τοῖς κλάδοις αὐτοῦ κατῴκουν τὰ ὄρνεα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἐτρέφετο πᾶσα σάρξ
10 ἐθεώρουν ἐν ὁράματι τῆς νυκτὸς ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης μου καὶ ἰδοὺ ιρ καὶ ἅγιος ἀ{P'} οὐρανοῦ κατέβη
11 καὶ ἐφώνησεν ἐν ἰσχύι καὶ οὕτως εἶπεν ἐκκόψατε τὸ δένδρον καὶ ἐκτίλατε τοὺς κλάδους αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκτινάξατε τὰ φύλλα αὐτοῦ καὶ διασκορπίσατε τὸν καρπὸν αὐτοῦ σαλευθήτωσαν τὰ θηρία ὑποκάτωθεν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ ὄρνεα ἀπὸ τῶν κλάδων αὐτοῦ
12 πλὴν τὴν φυὴν τῶν ῥιζῶν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐάσατε καὶ ἐν δεσμῷ σιδηρῷ καὶ χαλκῷ καὶ ἐν τῇ χλόῃ τῇ ἔξω καὶ ἐν τῇ δρόσῳ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κοιτασθήσεται καὶ μετὰ τῶν θηρίων ἡ μερὶς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ χόρτῳ τῆς γῆς
13 ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀλλοιωθήσεται καὶ καρδία θηρίου δοθήσεται αὐτῷ καὶ ἑπτὰ καιροὶ ἀλλαγήσονται ἐ{P'} αὐτόν
14 διὰ συγκρίματος ιρ ὁ λόγος καὶ ῥῆμα ἁγίων τὸ ἐπερώτημα ἵνα γνῶσιν οἱ ζῶντες ὅτι κύριός ἐστιν ὁ ὕψιστος τῆς βασιλείας τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ ᾧ ἐὰν δόξῃ δώσει αὐτὴν καὶ ἐξουδένημα ἀνθρώπων ἀναστήσει ἐ{P'} αὐτήν

15 τοῦτο τὸ ἐνύπνιον ὃ εἶδον ἐγὼ Ναβουχοδονοσορ ὁ βασιλεύς καὶ σύ Βαλτασαρ τὸ σύγκριμα εἰπόν ὅτι πάντες οἱ σοφοὶ τῆς βασιλείας μου οὐ δύνανται τὸ σύγκριμα αὐτοῦ δηλῶσαί μοι σὺ δέ Δανιηλ δύνασαι ὅτι πνεῦμα θεοῦ ἅγιον ἐν σοί

16 τότε Δανιηλ οὗ τὸ ὄνομα Βαλτασαρ ἀπηνεώθη ὡσεὶ ὥραν μίαν καὶ οἱ διαλογισμοὶ αὐτοῦ συνετάρασσον αὐτόν καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ εἶπεν Βαλτασαρ τὸ ἐνύπνιον καὶ ἡ σύγκρισις μὴ κατασπευσάτω σε καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Βαλτασαρ καὶ εἶπεν κύριε τὸ ἐνύπνιον τοῖς μισοῦσίν σε καὶ ἡ σύγκρισις αὐτοῦ τοῖς ἐχθροῖς σου
17 τὸ δένδρον ὃ εἶδες τὸ μεγαλυνθὲν καὶ τὸ ἰσχυκός οὗ τὸ ὕψος ἔφθασεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὸ κύτος αὐτοῦ εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν
18 καὶ τὰ φύλλα αὐτοῦ εὐθαλῆ καὶ ὁ καρπὸς αὐτοῦ πολὺς καὶ τροφὴ πᾶσιν ἐν αὐτῷ ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ κατῴκουν τὰ θηρία τὰ ἄγρια καὶ ἐν τοῖς κλάδοις αὐτοῦ κατεσκήνουν τὰ ὄρνεα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ
19 σὺ εἶ βασιλεῦ ὅτι ἐμεγαλύνθης καὶ ἴσχυσας καὶ ἡ μεγαλωσύνη σου ἐμεγαλύνθη καὶ ἔφθασεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ ἡ κυριεία σου εἰς τὰ πέρατα τῆς γῆς
20 καὶ ὅτι εἶδεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ιρ καὶ ἅγιον καταβαίνοντα ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ἐκτίλατε τὸ δένδρον καὶ διαφθείρατε αὐτό πλὴν τὴν φυὴν τῶν ῥιζῶν αὐτοῦ ἐάσατε ἐν τῇ γῇ καὶ ἐν δεσμῷ σιδηρῷ καὶ χαλκῷ καὶ ἐν τῇ χλόῃ τῇ ἔξω καὶ ἐν τῇ δρόσῳ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ αὐλισθήσεται καὶ μετὰ θηρίων ἀγρίων ἡ μερὶς αὐτοῦ ἕως οὗ ἑπτὰ καιροὶ ἀλλοιωθῶσιν ἐ{P'} αὐτόν
21 τοῦτο ἡ σύγκρισις αὐτοῦ βασιλεῦ καὶ σύγκριμα ὑψίστου ἐστίν ὃ ἔφθασεν ἐπὶ τὸν κύριόν μου τὸν βασιλέα
22 καὶ σὲ ἐκδιώξουσιν ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ μετὰ θηρίων ἀγρίων ἔσται ἡ κατοικία σου καὶ χόρτον ὡς βοῦν ψωμιοῦσίν σε καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δρόσου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ αὐλισθήσῃ καὶ ἑπτὰ καιροὶ ἀλλαγήσονται ἐπὶ σέ ἕως οὗ γνῷς ὅτι κυριεύει ὁ ὕψιστος τῆς βασιλείας τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ ᾧ ἂν δόξῃ δώσει αὐτήν
23 καὶ ὅτι εἶπαν ἐάσατε τὴν φυὴν τῶν ῥιζῶν τοῦ δένδρου ἡ βασιλεία σού σοι μενεῖ ἀ{F'} ἧς ἂν γνῷς τὴν ἐξουσίαν τὴν οὐράνιον
24 διὰ τοῦτο βασιλεῦ ἡ βουλή μου ἀρεσάτω σοι καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου ἐν ἐλεημοσύναις λύτρωσαι καὶ τὰς ἀδικίας σου ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς πενήτων ἴσως ἔσται μακρόθυμος τοῖς παραπτώμασίν σου ὁ θεός

25 ταῦτα πάντα ἔφθασεν ἐπὶ Ναβουχοδονοσορ τὸν βασιλέα
26 μετὰ δωδεκάμηνον ἐπὶ τῷ ναῷ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι περιπατῶν
27 ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ εἶπεν οὐχ αὕτη ἐστὶν Βαβυλὼν ἡ μεγάλη ἣν ἐγὼ ᾠκοδόμησα εἰς οἶκον βασιλείας ἐν τῷ κράτει τῆς ἰσχύος μου εἰς τιμὴν τῆς δόξης μου
28 ἔτι τοῦ λόγου ἐν στόματι τοῦ βασιλέως ὄντος φωνὴ ἀ{P'} οὐρανοῦ ἐγένετο σοὶ λέγουσιν Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεῦ ἡ βασιλεία παρῆλθεν ἀπὸ σοῦ
29 καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων σε ἐκδιώξουσιν καὶ μετὰ θηρίων ἀγρίων ἡ κατοικία σου καὶ χόρτον ὡς βοῦν ψωμιοῦσίν σε καὶ ἑπτὰ καιροὶ ἀλλαγήσονται ἐπὶ σέ ἕως οὗ γνῷς ὅτι κυριεύει ὁ ὕψιστος τῆς βασιλείας τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ ᾧ ἐὰν δόξῃ δώσει αὐτήν
30 αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ ὁ λόγος συνετελέσθη ἐπὶ Ναβουχοδονοσορ καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐξεδιώχθη καὶ χόρτον ὡς βοῦς ἤσθιεν καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δρόσου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐβάφη ἕως οὗ αἱ τρίχες αὐτοῦ ὡς λεόντων ἐμεγαλύνθησαν καὶ οἱ ὄνυχες αὐτοῦ ὡς ὀρνέων

31 καὶ μετὰ τὸ τέλος τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐγὼ Ναβουχοδονοσορ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀνέλαβον καὶ αἱ φρένες μου ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ ἐπεστράφησαν καὶ τῷ ὑψίστῳ εὐλόγησα καὶ τῷ ζῶντι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ᾔνεσα καὶ ἐδόξασα ὅτι ἡ ἐξουσία αὐτοῦ ἐξουσία αἰώνιος καὶ ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν
32 καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν ὡς οὐδὲν ἐλογίσθησαν καὶ κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ ποιεῖ ἐν τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἐν τῇ κατοικίᾳ τῆς γῆς καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἀντιποιήσεται τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ τί ἐποίησας
33 αὐτῷ τῷ καιρῷ αἱ φρένες μου ἐπεστράφησαν ἐ{P'} ἐμέ καὶ εἰς τὴν τιμὴν τῆς βασιλείας μου ἦλθον καὶ ἡ μορφή μου ἐπέστρεψεν ἐ{P'} ἐμέ καὶ οἱ τύραννοί μου καὶ οἱ μεγιστᾶνές μου ἐζήτουν με καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν μου ἐκραταιώθην καὶ μεγαλωσύνη περισσοτέρα προσετέθη μοι
34 νῦν οὖν ἐγὼ Ναβουχοδονοσορ αἰνῶ καὶ ὑπερυψῶ καὶ δοξάζω τὸν βασιλέα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ὅτι πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἀληθινὰ καὶ αἱ τρίβοι αὐτοῦ κρίσις καὶ πάντας τοὺς πορευομένους ἐν ὑπερηφανίᾳ δύναται ταπεινῶσαι
