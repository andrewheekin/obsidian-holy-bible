# Book of Daniel 14 (RSVCE)

### Daniel and the Priests of Bel
1 When King Astyʹages was laid with his fathers, Cyrus the Persian received his kingdom.
2 And Daniel was a companion of the king, and was the most honored of his friends.
3 Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and every day they spent on it twelve bushels of fine flour and forty sheep and fifty gallons of wine.
4 The king revered it and went every day to worship it. But Daniel worshiped his own God.
5 And the king said to him, “Why do you not worship Bel?” He answered, “Because I do not revere man-made idols, but the living God, who created heaven and earth and has dominion over all flesh.”
6 The king said to him, “Do you not think that Bel is a living God? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?”
7 Then Daniel laughed, and said, “Do not be deceived, O king; for this is but clay inside and brass outside, and it never ate or drank anything.”
8 Then the king was angry, and he called his priests and said to them, “If you do not tell me who is eating these provisions, you shall die.
9 But if you prove that Bel is eating them, Daniel shall die, because he blasphemed against Bel.” And Daniel said to the king, “Let it be done as you have said.”
10 Now there were seventy priests of Bel, besides their wives and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel.
11 And the priests of Bel said, “Behold, we are going outside; you yourself, O king, shall set forth the food and mix and place the wine, and shut the door and seal it with your signet.
12 And when you return in the morning, if you do not find that Bel has eaten it all, we will die; or else Daniel will, who is telling lies about us.”
13 They were unconcerned, for beneath the table they had made a hidden entrance, through which they used to go in regularly and consume the provisions.
14 When they had gone out, the king set forth the food for Bel. Then Daniel ordered his servants to bring ashes and they sifted them throughout the whole temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door and sealed it with the king’s signet, and departed.
15 In the night the priests came with their wives and children, as they were accustomed to do, and ate and drank everything.
16 Early in the morning the king rose and came, and Daniel with him.
17 And the king said, “Are the seals unbroken, Daniel?” He answered, “They are unbroken, O king.”
18 As soon as the doors were opened, the king looked at the table, and shouted in a loud voice, “You are great, O Bel; and with you there is no deceit, none at all.”
19 Then Daniel laughed, and restrained the king from going in, and said, “Look at the floor, and notice whose footsteps these are.”
20 The king said, “I see the footsteps of men and women and children.”
21 Then the king was enraged, and he seized the priests and their wives and children; and they showed him the secret doors through which they were accustomed to enter and devour what was on the table.
22 Therefore the king put them to death, and gave Bel over to Daniel, who destroyed it and its temple.
### Daniel Kills the Dragon
23 There was also a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered.
24 And the king said to Daniel, “You cannot deny that this is a living god; so worship him.”
25 Daniel said, “I will worship the Lord my God, for he is the living God.
26 But if you, O king, will give me permission, I will slay the dragon without sword or club.” The king said, “I give you permission.”
27 Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair, and boiled them together and made cakes, which he fed to the dragon. The dragon ate them, and burst open. And Daniel said, “See what you have been worshiping!”
28 When the Babylonians heard it, they were very indignant and conspired against the king, saying, “The king has become a Jew; he has destroyed Bel, and slain the dragon, and slaughtered the priests.”
29 Going to the king, they said, “Hand Daniel over to us, or else we will kill you and your household.”
30 The king saw that they were pressing him hard, and under compulsion he handed Daniel over to them.
### Daniel in the Lions’ Den
31 They threw Daniel into the lions’ den, and he was there for six days.
32 There were seven lions in the den, and every day they had been given two human bodies and two sheep; but these were not given to them now, so that they might devour Daniel.
33 Now the prophet Habʹakkuk was in Judea. He had boiled pottage and had broken bread into a bowl, and was going into the field to take it to the reapers.
34 But the angel of the Lord said to Habʹakkuk, “Take the dinner which you have to Babylon, to Daniel, in the lions’ den.”
35 Habʹakkuk said, “Sir, I have never seen Babylon, and I know nothing about the den.”
36 Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown of his head, and lifted him by his hair and set him down in Babylon, right over the den, with the rushing sound of the wind itself.
37 Then Habʹakkuk shouted, “Daniel, Daniel! Take the dinner which God has sent you.”
38 And Daniel said, “Thou hast remembered me, O God, and hast not forsaken those who love thee.”
39 So Daniel arose and ate. And the angel of God immediately returned Habʹakkuk to his own place.
40 On the seventh day the king came to mourn for Daniel. When he came to the den he looked in, and there sat Daniel.
41 And the king shouted with a loud voice, “Thou art great, O Lord God of Daniel, and there is no other besides thee.”
42 And he pulled Daniel out, and threw into the den the men who had attempted his destruction, and they were devoured immediately before his eyes.


# Prophetia Danielis 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Erat autem Daniel conviva regis, et honoratus super omnes amicos ejus.
2 Erat quoque idolum apud Babylonios nomine Bel: et impendebantur in eo per dies singulos similæ artabæ duodecim, et oves quadraginta, vinique amphoræ sex.
3 Rex quoque colebat eum, et ibat per singulos dies adorare eum: porro Daniel adorabat Deum suum. Dixitque ei rex: Quare non adoras Bel?
4 Qui respondens ait ei: Quia non colo idola manufacta, sed viventem Deum, qui creavit cælum, et terram, et habet potestatem omnis carnis.
5 Et dixit rex ad eum: Non videtur tibi esse Bel vivens deus? an non vides quanta comedat et bibat quotidie?
6 Et ait Daniel arridens: Ne erres, rex: iste enim intrinsecus luteus est, et forinsecus æreus, neque comedit aliquando.
7 Et iratus rex vocavit sacerdotes ejus, et ait eis: Nisi dixeritis mihi quis est qui comedat impensas has, moriemini.
8 Si autem ostenderitis quoniam Bel comedat hæc, morietur Daniel, quia blasphemavit in Bel. Et dixit Daniel regi: Fiat juxta verbum tuum.

9 Erant autem sacerdotes Bel septuaginta, exceptis uxoribus, et parvulis, et filiis.Et venit rex cum Daniele in templum Bel.
10 Et dixerunt sacerdotes Bel: Ecce nos egredimur foras: et tu, rex, pone escas, et vinum misce, et claude ostium, et signa annulo tuo:
11 et cum ingressus fueris mane, nisi inveneris omnia comesta a Bel, morte moriemur, vel Daniel qui mentitus est adversum nos.
12 Contemnebant autem, quia fecerant sub mensa absconditum introitum, et per illum ingrediebantur semper, et devorabant ea.
13 Factum est igitur postquam egressi sunt illi, rex posuit cibos ante Bel: præcepit Daniel pueris suis, et attulerunt cinerem, et cribravit per totum templum coram rege: et egressi clauserunt ostium, et signantes annulo regis abierunt.
14 Sacerdotes autem ingressi sunt nocte juxta consuetudinem suam, et uxores et filii eorum, et comederunt omnia, et biberunt.

15 Surrexit autem rex primo diluculo, et Daniel cum eo.
16 Et ait rex: Salvane sunt signacula, Daniel? Qui respondit: Salva, rex.
17 Statimque cum aperuisset ostium, intuitus rex mensam, exclamavit voce magna: Magnus es, Bel, et non est apud te dolus quisquam.
18 Et risit Daniel, et tenuit regem ne ingrederetur intro: et dixit: Ecce pavimentum: animadverte cujus vestigia sint hæc.
19 Et dixit rex: Video vestigia virorum, et mulierum, et infantium. Et iratus est rex.
20 Tunc apprehendit sacerdotes, et uxores, et filios eorum: et ostenderunt ei abscondita ostiola, per quæ ingrediebantur, et consumebant quæ erant super mensam.
21 Occidit ergo illos rex, et tradidit Bel in potestatem Danielis: qui subvertit eum, et templum ejus.

22 Et erat draco magnus in loco illo, et colebant eum Babylonii.
23 Et dixit rex Danieli: Ecce nunc non potes dicere quia iste non sit deus vivens: adora ergo eum.
24 Dixitque Daniel: Dominum Deum meum adoro, quia ipse est Deus vivens: iste autem non est deus vivens.
25 Tu autem, rex, da mihi potestatem, et interficiam draconem absque gladio et fuste. Et ait rex: Do tibi.
26 Tulit ergo Daniel picem, et adipem, et pilos, et coxit pariter: fecitque massas, et dedit in os draconis, et diruptus est draco. Et dixit: Ecce quem colebatis.

27 Quod cum audissent Babylonii, indignati sunt vehementer: et congregati adversum regem, dixerunt: Judæus factus est rex: Bel destruxit, draconem interfecit, et sacerdotes occidit.
28 Et dixerunt cum venissent ad regem: Trade nobis Danielem, alioquin interficiemus te, et domum tuam.
29 Vidit ergo rex quod irruerent in eum vehementer: et necessitate compulsus, tradidit eis Danielem.
30 Qui miserunt eum in lacum leonum, et erat ibi diebus sex.
31 Porro in lacu erant leones septem, et dabantur eis duo corpora quotidie, et duæ oves: et tunc non data sunt eis, ut devorarent Danielem.

32 Erat autem Habacuc propheta in Judæa, et ipse coxerat pulmentum, et intriverat panes in alveolo: et ibat in campum ut ferret messoribus.
33 Dixitque angelus Domini ad Habacuc: Fer prandium quod habes in Babylonem Danieli, qui est in lacu leonum.
34 Et dixit Habacuc: Domine, Babylonem non vidi, et lacum nescio.
35 Et apprehendit eum angelus Domini in vertice ejus, et portavit eum capillo capitis sui, posuitque eum in Babylone supra lacum in impetu spiritus sui.
36 Et clamavit Habacuc, dicens: Daniel serve Dei, tolle prandium quod misit tibi Deus.
37 Et ait Daniel: Recordatus es mei, Deus, et non dereliquisti diligentes te.
38 Surgensque Daniel comedit. Porro angelus Domini restituit Habacuc confestim in loco suo.

39 Venit ergo rex die septimo ut lugeret Danielem: et venit ad lacum, et introspexit, et ecce Daniel sedens in medio leonum.
40 Et exclamavit voce magna rex, dicens: Magnus es, Domine Deus Danielis. Et extraxit eum de lacu leonum.
41 Porro illos, qui perditionis ejus causa fuerant, intromisit in lacum, et devorati sunt in momento coram eo.
42 Tunc rex ait: Paveant omnes habitantes in universa terra Deum Danielis: quia ipse est salvator, faciens signa et mirabilia in terra: qui liberavit Danielem de lacu leonum.


# Δανιήλ 14 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀστυάγης προσετέθη πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας αὐτοῦ καὶ παρέλαβεν Κῦρος ὁ Πέρσης τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ ἦν Δανιηλ συμβιωτὴς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἔνδοξος ὑπὲρ πάντας τοὺς φίλους αὐτοῦ
3 καὶ ἦν εἴδωλον τοῖς Βαβυλωνίοις ᾧ ὄνομα Βηλ καὶ ἐδαπανῶντο εἰς αὐτὸν ἑκάστης ἡμέρας σεμιδάλεως ἀρτάβαι δώδεκα καὶ πρόβατα τεσσαράκοντα καὶ οἴνου μετρηταὶ ἕξ
4 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐσέβετο αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπορεύετο κα{Q'} ἑκάστην ἡμέραν προσκυνεῖν αὐτῷ Δανιηλ δὲ προσεκύνει τῷ θεῷ αὐτοῦ
5 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς διὰ τί οὐ προσκυνεῖς τῷ Βηλ ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ὅτι οὐ σέβομαι εἴδωλα χειροποίητα ἀλλὰ τὸν ζῶντα θεὸν τὸν κτίσαντα τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ ἔχοντα πάσης σαρκὸς κυριείαν
6 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς οὐ δοκεῖ σοι Βηλ εἶναι ζῶν θεός ἦ οὐχ ὁρᾷς ὅσα ἐσθίει καὶ πίνει κα{Q'} ἑκάστην ἡμέραν
7 καὶ εἶπεν Δανιηλ γελάσας μὴ πλανῶ βασιλεῦ οὗτος γὰρ ἔσωθεν μέν ἐστι πηλὸς ἔξωθεν δὲ χαλκὸς καὶ οὐ βέβρωκεν οὐδὲ πέπωκεν πώποτε
8 καὶ θυμωθεὶς ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐκάλεσεν τοὺς ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἐὰν μὴ εἴπητέ μοι τίς ὁ κατέσθων τὴν δαπάνην ταύτην ἀποθανεῖσθε ἐὰν δὲ δείξητε ὅτι Βηλ κατεσθίει αὐτά ἀποθανεῖται Δανιηλ ὅτι ἐβλασφήμησεν εἰς τὸν Βηλ

9 καὶ εἶπεν Δανιηλ τῷ βασιλεῖ γινέσθω κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου καὶ ἦσαν ἱερεῖς τοῦ Βηλ ἑβδομήκοντα ἐκτὸς γυναικῶν καὶ τέκνων
10 καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς μετὰ Δανιηλ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Βηλ
11 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τοῦ Βηλ ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς ἀποτρέχομεν ἔξω σὺ δέ βασιλεῦ παράθες τὰ βρώματα καὶ τὸν οἶνον κεράσας θὲς καὶ ἀπόκλεισον τὴν θύραν καὶ σφράγισον τῷ δακτυλίῳ σου καὶ ἐλθὼν πρωὶ ἐὰν μὴ εὕρῃς πάντα βεβρωμένα ὑπὸ τοῦ Βηλ ἀποθανούμεθα ἢ Δανιηλ ὁ ψευδόμενος κα{Q'} ἡμῶν
12 αὐτοὶ δὲ κατεφρόνουν ὅτι πεποιήκεισαν ὑπὸ τὴν τράπεζαν κεκρυμμένην εἴσοδον καὶ δ{I'} αὐτῆς εἰσεπορεύοντο διόλου καὶ ἀνήλουν αὐτά
13 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξήλθοσαν ἐκεῖνοι καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς παρέθηκεν τὰ βρώματα τῷ Βηλ
14 καὶ ἐπέταξεν Δανιηλ τοῖς παιδαρίοις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἤνεγκαν τέφραν καὶ κατέσησαν ὅλον τὸν ναὸν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως μόνου καὶ ἐξελθόντες ἔκλεισαν τὴν θύραν καὶ ἐσφραγίσαντο ἐν τῷ δακτυλίῳ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἀπῆλθον

15 οἱ δὲ ἱερεῖς ἦλθον τὴν νύκτα κατὰ τὸ ἔθος αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν καὶ κατέφαγον πάντα καὶ ἐξέπιον
16 καὶ ὤρθρισεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ πρωὶ καὶ Δανιηλ με{T'} αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς σῷοι αἱ σφραγῖδες Δανιηλ ὁ δὲ εἶπεν σῷοι βασιλεῦ
18 καὶ ἐγένετο ἅμα τῷ ἀνοῖξαι τὰς θύρας ἐπιβλέψας ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν ἐβόησεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ μέγας εἶ Βηλ καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν παρὰ σοὶ δόλος οὐδὲ εἷς
19 καὶ ἐγέλασεν Δανιηλ καὶ ἐκράτησεν τὸν βασιλέα τοῦ μὴ εἰσελθεῖν αὐτὸν ἔσω καὶ εἶπεν ἰδὲ δὴ τὸ ἔδαφος καὶ γνῶθι τίνος τὰ ἴχνη ταῦτα
20 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς ὁρῶ τὰ ἴχνη ἀνδρῶν καὶ γυναικῶν καὶ παιδίων
21 καὶ ὀργισθεὶς ὁ βασιλεὺς τότε συνέλαβεν τοὺς ἱερεῖς καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν καὶ ἔδειξαν αὐτῷ τὰς κρυπτὰς θύρας δ{I'} ὧν εἰσεπορεύοντο καὶ ἐδαπάνων τὰ ἐπὶ τῇ τραπέζῃ

22 καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ ἔδωκεν τὸν Βηλ ἔκδοτον τῷ Δανιηλ καὶ κατέστρεψεν αὐτὸν καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν αὐτοῦ
23 καὶ ἦν δράκων μέγας καὶ ἐσέβοντο αὐτὸν οἱ Βαβυλώνιοι
24 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Δανιηλ οὐ δύνασαι εἰπεῖν ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν οὗτος θεὸς ζῶν καὶ προσκύνησον αὐτῷ
25 καὶ εἶπεν Δανιηλ κυρίῳ τῷ θεῷ μου προσκυνήσω ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν θεὸς ζῶν σὺ δέ βασιλεῦ δός μοι ἐξουσίαν καὶ ἀποκτενῶ τὸν δράκοντα ἄνευ μαχαίρας καὶ ῥάβδου
26 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς δίδωμί σοι

27 καὶ ἔλαβεν Δανιηλ πίσσαν καὶ στῆρ καὶ τρίχας καὶ ἥψησεν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ καὶ ἐποίησεν μάζας καὶ ἔδωκεν εἰς τὸ στόμα τοῦ δράκοντος καὶ φαγὼν διερράγη ὁ δράκων καὶ εἶπεν ἴδετε τὰ σεβάσματα ὑμῶν
28 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσαν οἱ Βαβυλώνιοι ἠγανάκτησαν λίαν καὶ συνεστράφησαν ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα καὶ εἶπαν Ιουδαῖος γέγονεν ὁ βασιλεύς τὸν Βηλ κατέσπασεν καὶ τὸν δράκοντα ἀπέκτεινεν καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς κατέσφαξεν
29 καὶ εἶπαν ἐλθόντες πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα παράδος ἡμῖν τὸν Δανιηλ εἰ δὲ μή ἀποκτενοῦμέν σε καὶ τὸν οἶκόν σου
30 καὶ εἶδεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ὅτι ἐπείγουσιν αὐτὸν σφόδρα καὶ ἀναγκασθεὶς παρέδωκεν αὐτοῖς τὸν Δανιηλ
31 οἱ δὲ ἐνέβαλον αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας ἕξ

32 ἦσαν δὲ ἐν τῷ λάκκῳ ἑπτὰ λέοντες καὶ ἐδίδετο αὐτοῖς τὴν ἡμέραν δύο σώματα καὶ δύο πρόβατα τότε δὲ οὐκ ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς ἵνα καταφάγωσιν τὸν Δανιηλ
33 καὶ ἦν Αμβακουμ ὁ προφήτης ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ καὶ αὐτὸς ἥψησεν ἕψεμα καὶ ἐνέθρυψεν ἄρτους εἰς σκάφην καὶ ἐπορεύετο εἰς τὸ πεδίον ἀπενέγκαι τοῖς θερισταῖς
34 καὶ εἶπεν ἄγγελος κυρίου τῷ Αμβακουμ ἀπένεγκε τὸ ἄριστον ὃ ἔχεις εἰς Βαβυλῶνα τῷ Δανιηλ εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων
35 καὶ εἶπεν Αμβακουμ κύριε Βαβυλῶνα οὐχ ἑώρακα καὶ τὸν λάκκον οὐ γινώσκω
36 καὶ ἐπελάβετο ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου τῆς κορυφῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ βαστάσας τῆς κόμης τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἔθηκεν αὐτὸν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ἐπάνω τοῦ λάκκου ἐν τῷ ῥοίζῳ τοῦ πνεύματος αὐτοῦ
37 καὶ ἐβόησεν Αμβακουμ λέγων Δανιηλ Δανιηλ λαβὲ τὸ ἄριστον ὃ ἀπέστειλέν σοι ὁ θεός
38 καὶ εἶπεν Δανιηλ ἐμνήσθης γάρ μου ὁ θεός καὶ οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπες τοὺς ἀγαπῶντάς σε

39 καὶ ἀναστὰς Δανιηλ ἔφαγεν ὁ δὲ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ ἀπεκατέστησεν τὸν Αμβακουμ παραχρῆμα εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ
40 ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἦλθεν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ πενθῆσαι τὸν Δανιηλ καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν λάκκον καὶ ἐνέβλεψεν καὶ ἰδοὺ Δανιηλ καθήμενος
41 καὶ ἀναβοήσας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ εἶπεν μέγας εἶ κύριε ὁ θεὸς τοῦ Δανιηλ καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν πλὴν σοῦ ἄλλος
42 καὶ ἀνέσπασεν αὐτόν τοὺς δὲ αἰτίους τῆς ἀπωλείας αὐτοῦ ἐνέβαλεν εἰς τὸν λάκκον καὶ κατεβρώθησαν παραχρῆμα ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ
