# Book of Daniel 13 (RSVCE)

### Susanna’s Beauty Attracts Two Elders
1 There was a man living in Babylon whose name was Joʹakim.
2 And he took a wife named Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiʹah, a very beautiful woman and one who feared the Lord.
3 Her parents were righteous, and had taught their daughter according to the law of Moses.
4 Joʹakim was very rich, and had a spacious garden adjoining his house; and the Jews used to come to him because he was the most honored of them all.
5 In that year two elders from the people were appointed as judges. Concerning them the Lord had said: “Iniquity came forth from Babylon, from elders who were judges, who were supposed to govern the people.”
6 These men were frequently at Joʹakim’s house, and all who had suits at law came to them.
7 When the people departed at noon, Susanna would go into her husband’s garden to walk.
8 The two elders used to see her every day, going in and walking about, and they began to desire her.
9 And they perverted their minds and turned away their eyes from looking to Heaven or remembering righteous judgments.
10 Both were overwhelmed with passion for her, but they did not tell each other of their distress,
11 for they were ashamed to disclose their lustful desire to possess her.
12 And they watched eagerly, day after day, to see her.
13 They said to each other, “Let us go home, for it is mealtime.”
14 And when they went out, they parted from each other. But turning back, they met again; and when each pressed the other for the reason, they confessed their lust. And then together they arranged for a time when they could find her alone.
### The Elders Attempt to Seduce Susanna
15 Once, while they were watching for an opportune day, she went in as before with only two maids, and wished to bathe in the garden, for it was very hot.
16 And no one was there except the two elders, who had hid themselves and were watching her.
17 She said to her maids, “Bring me oil and ointments, and shut the garden doors so that I may bathe.”
18 They did as she said, shut the garden doors, and went out by the side doors to bring what they had been commanded; and they did not see the elders, because they were hidden.
19 When the maids had gone out, the two elders rose and ran to her, and said:
20 “Look, the garden doors are shut, no one sees us, and we are in love with you; so give your consent, and lie with us.
21 If you refuse, we will testify against you that a young man was with you, and this was why you sent your maids away.”
22 Susanna sighed deeply, and said, “I am hemmed in on every side. For if I do this thing, it is death for me; and if I do not, I shall not escape your hands.
23 I choose not to do it and to fall into your hands, rather than to sin in the sight of the Lord.”
24 Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and the two elders shouted against her.
25 And one of them ran and opened the garden doors.
26 When the household servants heard the shouting in the garden, they rushed in at the side door to see what had happened to her.
27 And when the elders told their tale, the servants were greatly ashamed, for nothing like this had ever been said about Susanna.
### The Elders Testify against Susanna
28 The next day, when the people gathered at the house of her husband Joʹakim, the two elders came, full of their wicked plot to have Susanna put to death.
29 They said before the people, “Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiʹah, who is the wife of Joʹakim.”
30 So they sent for her. And she came, with her parents, her children, and all her kindred.
31 Now Susanna was a woman of great refinement, and beautiful in appearance.
32 As she was veiled, the wicked men ordered her to be unveiled, that they might feed upon her beauty.
33 But her family and friends and all who saw her wept.
34 Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, and laid their hands upon her head.
35 And she, weeping, looked up toward heaven, for her heart trusted in the Lord.
36 The elders said, “As we were walking in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, shut the garden doors, and dismissed the maids.
37 Then a young man, who had been hidden, came to her and lay with her.
38 We were in a corner of the garden, and when we saw this wickedness we ran to them.
39 We saw them embracing, but we could not hold the man, for he was too strong for us, and he opened the doors and dashed out.
40 So we seized this woman and asked her who the young man was, but she would not tell us. These things we testify.”
41 The assembly believed them, because they were elders of the people and judges; and they condemned her to death.
42 Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, “O eternal God, who dost discern what is secret, who art aware of all things before they come to be,
43 thou knowest that these men have borne false witness against me. And now I am to die! Yet I have done none of the things that they have wickedly invented against me!”
44 The Lord heard her cry.
45 And as she was being led away to be put to death, God aroused the holy spirit of a young lad named Daniel;
46 and he cried with a loud voice, “I am innocent of the blood of this woman.”
### Daniel Rescues Susanna
47 All the people turned to him, and said, “What is this that you have said?”
48 Taking his stand in the midst of them, he said, “Are you such fools, you sons of Israel? Have you condemned a daughter of Israel without examination and without learning the facts?
49 Return to the place of judgment. For these men have borne false witness against her.”
50 Then all the people returned in haste. And the elders said to him, “Come, sit among us and inform us, for God has given you that right.”
51 And Daniel said to them, “Separate them far from each other, and I will examine them.”
52 When they were separated from each other, he summoned one of them and said to him, “You old relic of wicked days, your sins have now come home, which you have committed in the past,
53 pronouncing unjust judgments, condemning the innocent and letting the guilty go free, though the Lord said, ‘Do not put to death an innocent and righteous person.’
54 Now then, if you really saw her, tell me this: Under what tree did you see them being intimate with each other?” He answered, “Under a mastic tree.”
55 And Daniel said, “Very well! You have lied against your own head, for the angel of God has received the sentence from God and will immediately cut you in two.”
56 Then he put him aside, and commanded them to bring the other. And he said to him, “You offspring of Canaan and not of Judah, beauty has deceived you and lust has perverted your heart.
57 This is how you both have been dealing with the daughters of Israel, and they were intimate with you through fear; but a daughter of Judah would not endure your wickedness.
58 Now then, tell me: Under what tree did you catch them being intimate with each other?” He answered, “Under an evergreen oak.”
59 And Daniel said to him, “Very well! You also have lied against your own head, for the angel of God is waiting with his sword to saw you in two, that he may destroy you both.”
60 Then all the assembly shouted loudly and blessed God, who saves those who hope in him.
61 And they rose against the two elders, for out of their own mouths Daniel had convicted them of bearing false witness;
62 and they did to them as they had wickedly planned to do to their neighbor; acting in accordance with the law of Moses, they put them to death. Thus innocent blood was saved that day.
63 And Hilkiʹah and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, and so did Joʹakim her husband and all her kindred, because nothing shameful was found in her.
64 And from that day onward Daniel had a great reputation among the people.


# Prophetia Danielis 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et erat vir habitans in Babylone, et nomen ejus Joakim:
2 et accepit uxorem nomine Susannam, filiam Helciæ, pulchram nimis, et timentem Deum:
3 parentes enim illius, cum essent justi, erudierunt filiam suam secundum legem Moysi.
4 Erat autem Joakim dives valde, et erat ei pomarium vicinum domui suæ: et ad ipsum confluebant Judæi, eo quod esset honorabilior omnium.
5 Et constituti sunt de populo duo senes judices in illo anno, de quibus locutus est Dominus: Quia egressa est iniquitas de Babylone a senioribus judicibus, qui videbantur regere populum.
6 Isti frequentabant domum Joakim, et veniebant ad eos omnes qui habebant judicia.

7 Cum autem populus revertisset per meridiem, ingrediebatur Susanna, et deambulabat in pomario viri sui.
8 Et videbant eam senes quotidie ingredientem et deambulantem, et exarserunt in concupiscentiam ejus:
9 et everterunt sensum suum, et declinaverunt oculos suos ut non viderent cælum, neque recordarentur judiciorum justorum.
10 Erant ergo ambo vulnerati amore ejus, nec indicaverunt sibi vicissim dolorem suum:
11 erubescebant enim indicare sibi concupiscentiam suam, volentes concumbere cum ea.
12 Et observabant quotidie sollicitius videre eam. Dixitque alter ad alterum:
13 Eamus domum, quia hora prandii est. Et egressi, recesserunt a se.
14 Cumque revertissent, venerunt in unum: et sciscitantes ab invicem causam, confessi sunt concupiscentiam suam: et tunc in communi statuerunt tempus quando eam possent invenire solam.

15 Factum est autem, cum observarent diem aptum, ingressa est aliquando sicut heri et nudiustertius, cum duabus solis puellis, voluitque lavari in pomario: æstus quippe erat:
16 et non erat ibi quisquam, præter duos senes absconditos, et contemplantes eam.
17 Dixit ergo puellis: Afferte mihi oleum, et smigmata, et ostia pomarii claudite, ut laver.
18 Et fecerunt sicut præceperat: clauseruntque ostia pomarii, et egressæ sunt per posticum ut afferrent quæ jusserat; nesciebantque senes intus esse absconditos.
19 Cum autem egressæ essent puellæ, surrexerunt duo senes, et accurrerunt ad eam, et dixerunt:
20 Ecce ostia pomarii clausa sunt, et nemo nos videt, et nos in concupiscentia tui sumus: quam ob rem assentire nobis, et commiscere nobiscum.
21 Quod si nolueris, dicemus contra te testimonium, quod fuerit tecum juvenis, et ob hanc causam emiseris puellas a te.

22 Ingemuit Susanna, et ait: Angustiæ sunt mihi undique: si enim hoc egero, mors mihi est: si autem non egero, non effugiam manus vestras.
23 Sed melius est mihi absque opere incidere in manus vestras, quam peccare in conspectu Domini.
24 Et exclamavit voce magna Susanna: exclamaverunt autem et senes adversus eam.
25 Et cucurrit unus ad ostia pomarii, et aperuit.
26 Cum ergo audissent clamorem famuli domus in pomario, irruerunt per posticum ut viderent quidnam esset.
27 Postquam autem senes locuti sunt, erubuerunt servi vehementer, quia numquam dictus fuerat sermo hujuscemodi de Susanna. Et facta est dies crastina.
28 Cumque venisset populus ad Joakim virum ejus, venerunt et duo presbyteri, pleni iniqua cogitatione adversus Susannam ut interficerent eam.
29 Et dixerunt coram populo: Mittite ad Susannam filiam Helciæ uxorem Joakim. Et statim miserunt.
30 Et venit cum parentibus, et filiis, et universis cognatis suis.
31 Porro Susanna erat delicata nimis, et pulchra specie.
32 At iniqui illi jusserunt ut discooperiretur (erat enim cooperta), ut vel sic satiarentur decore ejus.
33 Flebant igitur sui, et omnes qui noverant eam.
34 Consurgentes autem duo presbyteri in medio populi, posuerunt manus suas super caput ejus.
35 Quæ flens suspexit ad cælum: erat enim cor ejus fiduciam habens in Domino.
36 Et dixerunt presbyteri: Cum deambularemus in pomario soli, ingressa est hæc cum duabus puellis: et clausit ostia pomarii, et dimisit a se puellas.
37 Venitque ad eam adolescens, qui erat absconditus, et concubuit cum ea.
38 Porro nos cum essemus in angulo pomarii, videntes iniquitatem, cucurrimus ad eos, et vidimus eos pariter commisceri.
39 Et illum quidem non quivimus comprehendere, quia fortior nobis erat, et apertis ostiis exilivit:
40 hanc autem cum apprehendissemus, interrogavimus, quisnam esset adolescens, et noluit indicare nobis: hujus rei testes sumus.

41 Credidit eis multitudo quasi senibus et judicibus populi, et condemnaverunt eam ad mortem.
42 Exclamavit autem voce magna Susanna, et dixit: Deus æterne, qui absconditorum es cognitor, qui nosti omnia antequam fiant,
43 tu scis quoniam falsum testimonium tulerunt contra me: et ecce morior, cum nihil horum fecerim, quæ isti malitiose composuerunt adversum me.
44 Exaudivit autem Dominus vocem ejus.
45 Cumque duceretur ad mortem, suscitavit Dominus spiritum sanctum pueri junioris, cujus nomen Daniel:
46 et exclamavit voce magna: Mundus ego sum a sanguine hujus.
47 Et conversus omnis populus ad eum, dixit: Quis est iste sermo, quem tu locutus es?
48 Qui cum staret in medio eorum, ait: Sic fatui filii Israël, non judicantes, neque quod verum est cognoscentes, condemnastis filiam Israël?
49 revertimini ad judicium, quia falsum testimonium locuti sunt adversus eam.

50 Reversus est ergo populus cum festinatione, et dixerunt ei senes: Veni, et sede in medio nostrum, et indica nobis: quia tibi Deus dedit honorem senectutis.
51 Et dixit ad eos Daniel: Separate illos ab invicem procul, et dijudicabo eos.
52 Cum ergo divisi essent alter ab altero, vocavit unum de eis, et dixit ad eum: Inveterate dierum malorum, nunc venerunt peccata tua, quæ operabaris prius:
53 judicans judicia injusta, innocentes opprimens, et dimittens noxios, dicente Domino: Innocentem et justum non interficies.
54 Nunc ergo, si vidisti eam, dic sub qua arbore videris eos colloquentes sibi. Qui ait: Sub schino.
55 Dixit autem Daniel: Recte mentitus es in caput tuum: ecce enim angelus Dei, accepta sententia ab eo, scindet te medium.
56 Et, amoto eo, jussit venire alium, et dixit ei: Semen Chanaan, et non Juda, species decepit te, et concupiscentia subvertit cor tuum:
57 sic faciebatis filiabus Israël, et illæ timentes loquebantur vobis: sed filia Juda non sustinuit iniquitatem vestram.
58 Nunc ergo, dic mihi sub qua arbore comprehenderis eos loquentes sibi. Qui ait: Sub prino.
59 Dixit autem ei Daniel: Recte mentitus es et tu in caput tuum: manet enim angelus Domini, gladium habens, ut secet te medium, et interficiat vos.

60 Exclamavit itaque omnis cœtus voce magna, et benedixerunt Deum, qui salvat sperantes in se.
61 Et consurrexerunt adversus duos presbyteros (convicerat enim eos Daniel ex ore suo falsum dixisse testimonium), feceruntque eis sicut male egerant adversus proximum,
62 ut facerent secundum legem Moysi. Et interfecerunt eos, et salvatus est sanguis innoxius in die illa.
63 Helcias autem et uxor ejus laudaverunt Deum pro filia sua Susanna cum Joakim marito ejus, et cognatis omnibus, quia non esset inventa in ea res turpis.
64 Daniel autem factus est magnus in conspectu populi a die illa, et deinceps.

65 Et rex Astyages appositus est ad patres suos, et suscepit Cyrus Perses regnum ejus.

1 καὶ ἦν ἀνὴρ οἰκῶν ἐν Βαβυλῶνι καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Ιωακιμ
2 καὶ ἔλαβεν γυναῖκα ᾗ ὄνομα Σουσαννα θυγάτηρ Χελκιου καλὴ σφόδρα καὶ φοβουμένη τὸν κύριον
3 καὶ οἱ γονεῖς αὐτῆς δίκαιοι καὶ ἐδίδαξαν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτῶν κατὰ τὸν νόμον Μωυσῆ
4 καὶ ἦν Ιωακιμ πλούσιος σφόδρα καὶ ἦν αὐτῷ παράδεισος γειτνιῶν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ πρὸς αὐτὸν προσήγοντο οἱ Ιουδαῖοι διὰ τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν ἐνδοξότερον πάντων
5 καὶ ἀπεδείχθησαν δύο πρεσβύτεροι ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ κριταὶ ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ περὶ ὧν ἐλάλησεν ὁ δεσπότης ὅτι ἐξῆλθεν ἀνομία ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος ἐκ πρεσβυτέρων κριτῶν οἳ ἐδόκουν κυβερνᾶν τὸν λαόν
6 οὗτοι προσεκαρτέρουν ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ Ιωακιμ καὶ ἤρχοντο πρὸς αὐτοὺς πάντες οἱ κρινόμενοι

7 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἀπέτρεχεν ὁ λαὸς μέσον ἡμέρας εἰσεπορεύετο Σουσαννα καὶ περιεπάτει ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς
8 καὶ ἐθεώρουν αὐτὴν οἱ δύο πρεσβύτεροι κα{Q'} ἡμέραν εἰσπορευομένην καὶ περιπατοῦσαν καὶ ἐγένοντο ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ αὐτῆς
9 καὶ διέστρεψαν τὸν ἑαυτῶν νοῦν καὶ ἐξέκλιναν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν τοῦ μὴ βλέπειν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν μηδὲ μνημονεύειν κριμάτων δικαίων
10 καὶ ἦσαν ἀμφότεροι κατανενυγμένοι περὶ αὐτῆς καὶ οὐκ ἀνήγγειλαν ἀλλήλοις τὴν ὀδύνην αὐτῶν
11 ὅτι ᾐσχύνοντο ἀναγγεῖλαι τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν αὐτῶν ὅτι ἤθελον συγγενέσθαι αὐτῇ
12 καὶ παρετηροῦσαν φιλοτίμως κα{Q'} ἡμέραν ὁρᾶν αὐτήν
13 καὶ εἶπαν ἕτερος τῷ ἑτέρῳ πορευθῶμεν δὴ εἰς οἶκον ὅτι ἀρίστου ὥρα ἐστίν καὶ ἐξελθόντες διεχωρίσθησαν ἀ{P'} ἀλλήλων
14 καὶ ἀνακάμψαντες ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ καὶ ἀνετάζοντες ἀλλήλους τὴν αἰτίαν ὡμολόγησαν τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν αὐτῶν καὶ τότε κοινῇ συνετάξαντο καιρὸν ὅτε αὐτὴν δυνήσονται εὑρεῖν μόνην

15 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ παρατηρεῖν αὐτοὺς ἡμέραν εὔθετον εἰσῆλθέν ποτε καθὼς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης ἡμέρας μετὰ δύο μόνων κορασίων καὶ ἐπεθύμησε λούσασθαι ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ ὅτι καῦμα ἦν
16 καὶ οὐκ ἦν οὐδεὶς ἐκεῖ πλὴν οἱ δύο πρεσβύτεροι κεκρυμμένοι καὶ παρατηροῦντες αὐτήν
17 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς κορασίοις ἐνέγκατε δή μοι ἔλαιον καὶ σμῆγμα καὶ τὰς θύρας τοῦ παραδείσου κλείσατε ὅπως λούσωμαι
18 καὶ ἐποίησαν καθὼς εἶπεν καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν τὰς θύρας τοῦ παραδείσου καὶ ἐξῆλθαν κατὰ τὰς πλαγίας θύρας ἐνέγκαι τὰ προστεταγμένα αὐταῖς καὶ οὐκ εἴδοσαν τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὅτι ἦσαν κεκρυμμένοι
19 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξήλθοσαν τὰ κοράσια καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ δύο πρεσβῦται καὶ ἐπέδραμον αὐτῇ
20 καὶ εἶπον ἰδοὺ αἱ θύραι τοῦ παραδείσου κέκλεινται καὶ οὐδεὶς θεωρεῖ ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ σού ἐσμεν διὸ συγκατάθου ἡμῖν καὶ γενοῦ με{Q'} ἡμῶν
21 εἰ δὲ μή καταμαρτυρήσομέν σου ὅτι ἦν μετὰ σοῦ νεανίσκος καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἐξαπέστειλας τὰ κοράσια ἀπὸ σοῦ

22 καὶ ἀνεστέναξεν Σουσαννα καὶ εἶπεν στενά μοι πάντοθεν ἐάν τε γὰρ τοῦτο πράξω θάνατός μοί ἐστιν ἐάν τε μὴ πράξω οὐκ ἐκφεύξομαι τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν
23 αἱρετόν μοί ἐστιν μὴ πράξασαν ἐμπεσεῖν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν ἢ ἁμαρτεῖν ἐνώπιον κυρίου
24 καὶ ἀνεβόησεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Σουσαννα ἐβόησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ δύο πρεσβῦται κατέναντι αὐτῆς
25 καὶ δραμὼν ὁ εἷς ἤνοιξεν τὰς θύρας τοῦ παραδείσου
26 ὡς δὲ ἤκουσαν τὴν κραυγὴν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ οἱ ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας εἰσεπήδησαν διὰ τῆς πλαγίας θύρας ἰδεῖν τὸ συμβεβηκὸς αὐτῇ
27 ἡνίκα δὲ εἶπαν οἱ πρεσβῦται τοὺς λόγους αὐτῶν κατῃσχύνθησαν οἱ δοῦλοι σφόδρα ὅτι πώποτε οὐκ ἐρρέθη λόγος τοιοῦτος περὶ Σουσαννης
28 καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ ἐπαύριον ὡς συνῆλθεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς Ιωακιμ ἦλθον οἱ δύο πρεσβῦται πλήρεις τῆς ἀνόμου ἐννοίας κατὰ Σουσαννης τοῦ θανατῶσαι αὐτὴν
29 καὶ εἶπαν ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ λαοῦ ἀποστείλατε ἐπὶ Σουσανναν θυγατέρα Χελκιου ἥ ἐστιν γυνὴ Ιωακιμ οἱ δὲ ἀπέστειλαν
30 καὶ ἦλθεν αὐτὴ καὶ οἱ γονεῖς αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς καὶ πάντες οἱ συγγενεῖς αὐτῆς
31 ἡ δὲ Σουσαννα ἦν τρυφερὰ σφόδρα καὶ καλὴ τῷ εἴδει
32 οἱ δὲ παράνομοι ἐκέλευσαν ἀποκαλυφθῆναι αὐτήν ἦν γὰρ κατακεκαλυμμένη ὅπως ἐμπλησθῶσιν τοῦ κάλλους αὐτῆς
33 ἔκλαιον δὲ οἱ πα{R'} αὐτῆς καὶ πάντες οἱ ἰδόντες αὐτήν
34 ἀναστάντες δὲ οἱ δύο πρεσβῦται ἐν μέσῳ τῷ λαῷ ἔθηκαν τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῆς
35 ἡ δὲ κλαίουσα ἀνέβλεψεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν ὅτι ἦν ἡ καρδία αὐτῆς πεποιθυῖα ἐπὶ τῷ κυρίῳ
36 εἶπαν δὲ οἱ πρεσβῦται περιπατούντων ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ μόνων εἰσῆλθεν αὕτη μετὰ δύο παιδισκῶν καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν τὰς θύρας τοῦ παραδείσου καὶ ἀπέλυσεν τὰς παιδίσκας
37 καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς αὐτὴν νεανίσκος ὃς ἦν κεκρυμμένος καὶ ἀνέπεσε με{T'} αὐτῆς
38 ἡμεῖς δὲ ὄντες ἐν τῇ γωνίᾳ τοῦ παραδείσου ἰδόντες τὴν ἀνομίαν ἐδράμομεν ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
39 καὶ ἰδόντες συγγινομένους αὐτοὺς ἐκείνου μὲν οὐκ ἠδυνήθημεν ἐγκρατεῖς γενέσθαι διὰ τὸ ἰσχύειν αὐτὸν ὑπὲρ ἡμᾶς καὶ ἀνοίξαντα τὰς θύρας ἐκπεπηδηκέναι
40 ταύτης δὲ ἐπιλαβόμενοι ἐπηρωτῶμεν τίς ἦν ὁ νεανίσκος

41 καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ἀναγγεῖλαι ἡμῖν ταῦτα μαρτυροῦμεν καὶ ἐπίστευσεν αὐτοῖς ἡ συναγωγὴ ὡς πρεσβυτέροις τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ κριταῖς καὶ κατέκριναν αὐτὴν ἀποθανεῖν
42 ἀνεβόησεν δὲ φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Σουσαννα καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεὸς ὁ αἰώνιος ὁ τῶν κρυπτῶν γνώστης ὁ εἰδὼς τὰ πάντα πρὶν γενέσεως αὐτῶν
43 σὺ ἐπίστασαι ὅτι ψευδῆ μου κατεμαρτύρησαν καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀποθνῄσκω μὴ ποιήσασα μηδὲν ὧν οὗτοι ἐπονηρεύσαντο κα{T'} ἐμοῦ
44 καὶ εἰσήκουσεν κύριος τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῆς
45 καὶ ἀπαγομένης αὐτῆς ἀπολέσθαι ἐξήγειρεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον παιδαρίου νεωτέρου ᾧ ὄνομα Δανιηλ
46 καὶ ἐβόησεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ καθαρὸς ἐγὼ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος ταύτης
47 ἐπέστρεψεν δὲ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπαν τίς ὁ λόγος οὗτος ὃν σὺ λελάληκας
48 ὁ δὲ στὰς ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν εἶπεν οὕτως μωροί οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ οὐκ ἀνακρίναντες οὐδὲ τὸ σαφὲς ἐπιγνόντες κατεκρίνατε θυγατέρα Ισραηλ
49 ἀναστρέψατε εἰς τὸ κριτήριον ψευδῆ γὰρ οὗτοι κατεμαρτύρησαν αὐτῆς

50 καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς μετὰ σπουδῆς καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι δεῦρο κάθισον ἐν μέσῳ ἡμῶν καὶ ἀνάγγειλον ἡμῖν ὅτι σοὶ δέδωκεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ πρεσβεῖον
51 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Δανιηλ διαχωρίσατε αὐτοὺς ἀ{P'} ἀλλήλων μακράν καὶ ἀνακρινῶ αὐτούς
52 ὡς δὲ διεχωρίσθησαν εἷς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑνός ἐκάλεσεν τὸν ἕνα αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν πεπαλαιωμένε ἡμερῶν κακῶν νῦν ἥκασιν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου ἃς ἐποίεις τὸ πρότερον
53 κρίνων κρίσεις ἀδίκους καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἀθῴους κατακρίνων ἀπολύων δὲ τοὺς αἰτίους λέγοντος τοῦ κυρίου ἀθῷον καὶ δίκαιον οὐκ ἀποκτενεῖς
54 νῦν οὖν ταύτην εἴπερ εἶδες εἰπόν ὑπὸ τί δένδρον εἶδες αὐτοὺς ὁμιλοῦντας ἀλλήλοις ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ὑπὸ σχῖνον
55 εἶπεν δὲ Δανιηλ ὀρθῶς ἔψευσαι εἰς τὴν σεαυτοῦ κεφαλήν ἤδη γὰρ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ λαβὼν φάσιν παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ σχίσει σε μέσον
56 καὶ μεταστήσας αὐτὸν ἐκέλευσεν προσαγαγεῖν τὸν ἕτερον καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ σπέρμα Χανααν καὶ οὐκ Ιουδα τὸ κάλλος ἐξηπάτησέν σε καὶ ἡ ἐπιθυμία διέστρεψεν τὴν καρδίαν σου
57 οὕτως ἐποιεῖτε θυγατράσιν Ισραηλ καὶ ἐκεῖναι φοβούμεναι ὡμίλουν ὑμῖν ἀλ{L'} οὐ θυγάτηρ Ιουδα ὑπέμεινεν τὴν ἀνομίαν ὑμῶν
58 νῦν οὖν λέγε μοι ὑπὸ τί δένδρον κατέλαβες αὐτοὺς ὁμιλοῦντας ἀλλήλοις ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ὑπὸ πρῖνον
59 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Δανιηλ ὀρθῶς ἔψευσαι καὶ σὺ εἰς τὴν σεαυτοῦ κεφαλήν μένει γὰρ ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ τὴν ῥομφαίαν ἔχων πρίσαι σε μέσον ὅπως ἐξολεθρεύσῃ ὑμᾶς

60 καὶ ἀνεβόησεν πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ φωνῇ μεγάλῃ καὶ εὐλόγησαν τῷ θεῷ τῷ σῴζοντι τοὺς ἐλπίζοντας ἐ{P'} αὐτόν
61 καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἐπὶ τοὺς δύο πρεσβύτας ὅτι συνέστησεν αὐτοὺς Δανιηλ ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτῶν ψευδομαρτυρήσαντας καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτοῖς ὃν τρόπον ἐπονηρεύσαντο τῷ πλησίον
62 ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸν νόμον Μωυσῆ καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτούς καὶ ἐσώθη αἷμα ἀναίτιον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ
63 Χελκιας δὲ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ᾔνεσαν τὸν θεὸν περὶ τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτῶν Σουσαννας μετὰ Ιωακιμ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ τῶν συγγενῶν πάντων ὅτι οὐχ εὑρέθη ἐν αὐτῇ ἄσχημον πρᾶγμα
64 καὶ Δανιηλ ἐγένετο μέγας ἐνώπιον τοῦ λαοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης καὶ ἐπέκεινα
