# Book of Daniel 6 (RSVCE)

### The Plot against Daniel
1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom;
2 and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss.
3 Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.
4 Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom; but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him.
5 Then these men said, “We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”
6 Then these presidents and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, “O King Darius, live for ever!
7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an interdict, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.
8 Now, O king, establish the interdict and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked.”
9 Therefore King Darius signed the document and interdict.
### Daniel in the Lions’ Den
10 When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem; and he got down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.
11 Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
12 Then they came near and said before the king, concerning the interdict, “O king! Did you not sign an interdict, that any man who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king answered, “The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.”
13 Then they answered before the king, “That Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no heed to you, O king, or the interdict you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.”
14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed, and set his mind to deliver Daniel; and he labored till the sun went down to rescue him.
15 Then these men came by agreement to the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no interdict or ordinance which the king establishes can be changed.”
16 Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!”
17 And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
18 Then the king went to his palace, and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.
### Daniel Saved from the Lions
19 Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions.
20 When he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish and said to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”
21 Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live for ever!
22 My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong.”
23 Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of hurt was found upon him, beause he had trusted in his God.
24 And the king commanded, and those men who had accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions—they, their children, and their wives; and before they reached the bottom of the den the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.
25 Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: “Peace be multiplied to you.
26 I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, enduring for ever; his kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end.
27 He delivers and rescues, he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions.”
28 So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.


# Prophetia Danielis 6 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Placuit Dario, et constituit super regnum satrapas centum viginti ut essent in toto regno suo.
2 Et super eos principes tres, ex quibus Daniel unus erat: ut satrapæ illis redderent rationem, et rex non sustineret molestiam.
3 Igitur Daniel superabat omnes principes et satrapas, quia spiritus Dei amplior erat in illo.
4 Porro rex cogitabat constituere eum super omne regnum: unde principes, et satrapæ quærebant occasionem ut invenirent Danieli ex latere regis: nullamque causam, et suspicionem reperire potuerunt, eo quod fidelis esset, et omnis culpa, et suspicio non inveniretur in eo.
5 Dixerunt ergo viri illi: Non inveniemus Danieli huic aliquam occasionem, nisi forte in lege Dei sui.

6 Tunc principes et satrapæ surripuerunt regi, et sic locuti sunt ei: Dari rex, in æternum vive!
7 consilium inierunt omnes principes regni tui, magistratus, et satrapæ, senatores, et judices, ut decretum imperatorium exeat, et edictum: ut omnis, qui petierit aliquam petitionem a quocumque deo et homine usque ad triginta dies, nisi a te, rex, mittatur in lacum leonum.
8 Nunc itaque rex, confirma sententiam, et scribe decretum: ut non immutetur quod statutum est a Medis et Persis, nec prævaricari cuiquam liceat.

9 Porro rex Darius proposuit edictum, et statuit.
10 Quod cum Daniel comperisset, id est, constitutam legem, ingressus est domum suam: et fenestris apertis in cœnaculo suo contra Jerusalem tribus temporibus in die flectebat genua sua, et adorabat, confitebaturque coram Deo suo sicut et ante facere consueverat.
11 Viri ergo illi curiosius inquirentes invenerunt Danielem orantem, et obsecrantem Deum suum.
12 Et accedentes locuti sunt regi super edicto: Rex, numquid non constituisti ut omnis homo qui rogaret quemquam de diis et hominibus usque ad dies triginta, nisi te, rex, mitteretur in lacum leonum? Ad quos respondens rex, ait: Verus est sermo juxta decretum Medorum atque Persarum, quod prævaricari non licet.
13 Tunc respondentes dixerunt coram rege: Daniel de filiis captivitatis Juda, non curavit de lege tua, et de edicto quod constituisti: sed tribus temporibus per diem orat obsecratione sua.

14 Quod verbum cum audisset rex, satis contristatus est: et pro Daniele posuit cor ut liberaret eum, et usque ad occasum solis laborabat ut erueret illum.
15 Viri autem illi, intelligentes regem, dixerunt ei: Scito, rex, quia lex Medorum atque Persarum est ut omne decretum, quod constituerit rex, non liceat immutari.
16 Tunc rex præcepit, et adduxerunt Danielem, et miserunt eum in lacum leonum. Dixitque rex Danieli: Deus tuus, quem colis semper, ipse liberabit te.
17 Allatusque est lapis unus, et positus est super os laci: quem obsignavit rex annulo suo, et annulo optimatum suorum, ne quid fieret contra Danielem.
18 Et abiit rex in domum suam, et dormivit incœnatus, cibique non sunt allati coram eo, insuper et somnus recessit ab eo.

19 Tunc rex primo diluculo consurgens, festinus ad lacum leonum perrexit:
20 appropinquansque lacui, Danielem voce lacrimabili inclamavit, et affatus est eum: Daniel serve Dei viventis, Deus tuus, cui tu servis semper, putasne valuit te liberare a leonibus?
21 Et Daniel regi respondens ait: Rex, in æternum vive!
22 Deus meus misit angelum suum, et conclusit ora leonum, et non nocuerunt mihi: quia coram eo justitia inventa est in me: sed et coram te, rex, delictum non feci.
23 Tunc vehementer rex gavisus est super eo, et Danielem præcepit educi de lacu: eductusque est Daniel de lacu, et nulla læsio inventa est in eo, quia credidit Deo suo.
24 Jubente autem rege, adducti sunt viri illi, qui accusaverant Danielem: et in lacum leonum missi sunt, ipsi, et filii, et uxores eorum: et non pervenerunt usque ad pavimentum laci, donec arriperent eos leones, et omnia ossa eorum comminuerunt.

25 Tunc Darius rex scripsit universis populis, tribubus, et linguis habitantibus in universa terra: Pax vobis multiplicetur.
26 A me constitutum est decretum, ut in universo imperio et regno meo, tremiscant et paveant Deum Danielis: ipse est enim Deus vivens, et æternus in sæcula, et regnum ejus non dissipabitur, et potestas ejus usque in æternum.
27 Ipse liberator atque salvator, faciens signa et mirabilia in cælo et in terra: qui liberavit Danielem de lacu leonum.

28 Porro Daniel perseveravit usque ad regnum Darii, regnumque Cyri Persæ.


# Δανιήλ 6 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιον Δαρείου καὶ κατέστησεν ἐπὶ τῆς βασιλείας σατράπας ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι τοῦ εἶναι αὐτοὺς ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ ἐπάνω αὐτῶν τακτικοὺς τρεῖς ὧν ἦν Δανιηλ εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν τοῦ ἀποδιδόναι αὐτοῖς τοὺς σατράπας λόγον ὅπως ὁ βασιλεὺς μὴ ἐνοχλῆται
3 καὶ ἦν Δανιηλ ὑπὲρ αὐτούς ὅτι πνεῦμα περισσὸν ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐ{F'} ὅλης τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ
4 καὶ οἱ τακτικοὶ καὶ οἱ σατράπαι ἐζήτουν πρόφασιν εὑρεῖν κατὰ Δανιηλ καὶ πᾶσαν πρόφασιν καὶ παράπτωμα καὶ ἀμβλάκημα οὐχ εὗρον κα{T'} αὐτοῦ ὅτι πιστὸς ἦν
5 καὶ εἶπον οἱ τακτικοί οὐχ εὑρήσομεν κατὰ Δανιηλ πρόφασιν εἰ μὴ ἐν νομίμοις θεοῦ αὐτοῦ

6 τότε οἱ τακτικοὶ καὶ οἱ σατράπαι παρέστησαν τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ Δαρεῖε βασιλεῦ εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας ζῆθι
7 συνεβουλεύσαντο πάντες οἱ ἐπὶ τῆς βασιλείας σου στρατηγοὶ καὶ σατράπαι ὕπατοι καὶ τοπάρχαι τοῦ στῆσαι στάσει βασιλικῇ καὶ ἐνισχῦσαι ὁρισμόν ὅπως ὃς ἂν αἰτήσῃ αἴτημα παρὰ παντὸς θεοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπου ἕως ἡμερῶν τριάκοντα ἀλ{L'} ἢ παρὰ σοῦ βασιλεῦ ἐμβληθήσεται εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων
8 νῦν οὖν βασιλεῦ στῆσον τὸν ὁρισμὸν καὶ ἔκθες γραφήν ὅπως μὴ ἀλλοιωθῇ τὸ δόγμα Μήδων καὶ Περσῶν

9 τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαρεῖος ἐπέταξεν γραφῆναι τὸ δόγμα
10 καὶ Δανιηλ ἡνίκα ἔγνω ὅτι ἐνετάγη τὸ δόγμα εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ θυρίδες ἀνεῳγμέναι αὐτῷ ἐν τοῖς ὑπερῴοις αὐτοῦ κατέναντι Ιερουσαλημ καὶ καιροὺς τρεῖς τῆς ἡμέρας ἦν κάμπτων ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατα αὐτοῦ καὶ προσευχόμενος καὶ ἐξομολογούμενος ἐναντίον τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ καθὼς ἦν ποιῶν ἔμπροσθεν
11 τότε οἱ ἄνδρες ἐκεῖνοι παρετήρησαν καὶ εὗρον τὸν Δανιηλ ἀξιοῦντα καὶ δεόμενον τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ
12 καὶ προσελθόντες λέγουσιν τῷ βασιλεῖ βασιλεῦ οὐχ ὁρισμὸν ἔταξας ὅπως πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἂν αἰτήσῃ παρὰ παντὸς θεοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπου αἴτημα ἕως ἡμερῶν τριάκοντα ἀλ{L'} ἢ παρὰ σοῦ βασιλεῦ ἐμβληθήσεται εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς ἀληθινὸς ὁ λόγος καὶ τὸ δόγμα Μήδων καὶ Περσῶν οὐ παρελεύσεται
13 τότε ἀπεκρίθησαν καὶ λέγουσιν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως Δανιηλ ὁ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τῆς Ιουδαίας οὐχ ὑπετάγη τῷ δόγματί σου περὶ τοῦ ὁρισμοῦ οὗ ἔταξας καὶ καιροὺς τρεῖς τῆς ἡμέρας αἰτεῖ παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ τὰ αἰτήματα αὐτοῦ

14 τότε ὁ βασιλεύς ὡς τὸ ῥῆμα ἤκουσεν πολὺ ἐλυπήθη ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ καὶ περὶ τοῦ Δανιηλ ἠγωνίσατο τοῦ ἐξελέσθαι αὐτὸν καὶ ἕως ἑσπέρας ἦν ἀγωνιζόμενος τοῦ ἐξελέσθαι αὐτόν
15 τότε οἱ ἄνδρες ἐκεῖνοι λέγουσιν τῷ βασιλεῖ γνῶθι βασιλεῦ ὅτι δόγμα Μήδοις καὶ Πέρσαις τοῦ πᾶν ὁρισμὸν καὶ στάσιν ἣν ἂν ὁ βασιλεὺς στήσῃ οὐ δεῖ παραλλάξαι
16 τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς εἶπεν καὶ ἤγαγον τὸν Δανιηλ καὶ ἐνέβαλον αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Δανιηλ ὁ θεός σου ᾧ σὺ λατρεύεις ἐνδελεχῶς αὐτὸς ἐξελεῖταί σε
17 καὶ ἤνεγκαν λίθον καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπὶ τὸ στόμα τοῦ λάκκου καὶ ἐσφραγίσατο ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν τῷ δακτυλίῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τῷ δακτυλίῳ τῶν μεγιστάνων αὐτοῦ ὅπως μὴ ἀλλοιωθῇ πρᾶγμα ἐν τῷ Δανιηλ
18 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἄδειπνος καὶ ἐδέσματα οὐκ εἰσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ καὶ ὁ ὕπνος ἀπέστη ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν ὁ θεὸς τὰ στόματα τῶν λεόντων καὶ οὐ παρηνώχλησαν τῷ Δανιηλ

19 τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀνέστη τὸ πρωὶ ἐν τῷ φωτὶ καὶ ἐν σπουδῇ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων
20 καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐγγίζειν αὐτὸν τῷ λάκκῳ ἐβόησεν φωνῇ ἰσχυρᾷ Δανιηλ ὁ δοῦλος τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ζῶντος ὁ θεός σου ᾧ σὺ λατρεύεις ἐνδελεχῶς εἰ ἠδυνήθη ἐξελέσθαι σε ἐκ στόματος τῶν λεόντων
21 καὶ εἶπεν Δανιηλ τῷ βασιλεῖ βασιλεῦ εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας ζῆθι
22 ὁ θεός μου ἀπέστειλεν τὸν ἄγγελον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐνέφραξεν τὰ στόματα τῶν λεόντων καὶ οὐκ ἐλυμήναντό με ὅτι κατέναντι αὐτοῦ εὐθύτης ηὑρέθη μοι καὶ ἐνώπιον δὲ σοῦ βασιλεῦ παράπτωμα οὐκ ἐποίησα
23 τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς πολὺ ἠγαθύνθη ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ καὶ τὸν Δανιηλ εἶπεν ἀνενέγκαι ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου καὶ ἀνηνέχθη Δανιηλ ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου καὶ πᾶσα διαφθορὰ οὐχ εὑρέθη ἐν αὐτῷ ὅτι ἐπίστευσεν ἐν τῷ θεῷ αὐτοῦ
24 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς καὶ ἠγάγοσαν τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς διαβαλόντας τὸν Δανιηλ καὶ εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων ἐνεβλήθησαν αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καὶ οὐκ ἔφθασαν εἰς τὸ ἔδαφος τοῦ λάκκου ἕως οὗ ἐκυρίευσαν αὐτῶν οἱ λέοντες καὶ πάντα τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν ἐλέπτυναν

25 τότε Δαρεῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἔγραψεν πᾶσι τοῖς λαοῖς φυλαῖς γλώσσαις τοῖς οἰκοῦσιν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ εἰρήνη ὑμῖν πληθυνθείη
26 ἐκ προσώπου μου ἐτέθη δόγμα τοῦ ἐν πάσῃ ἀρχῇ τῆς βασιλείας μου εἶναι τρέμοντας καὶ φοβουμένους ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ θεοῦ Δανιηλ ὅτι αὐτός ἐστιν θεὸς ζῶν καὶ μένων εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας καὶ ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ οὐ διαφθαρήσεται καὶ ἡ κυριεία αὐτοῦ ἕως τέλους
27 ἀντιλαμβάνεται καὶ ῥύεται καὶ ποιεῖ σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ὅστις ἐξείλατο τὸν Δανιηλ ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν λεόντων

28 καὶ Δανιηλ κατεύθυνεν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ Δαρείου καὶ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ Κύρου τοῦ Πέρσου
