# Second Book of Samuel 13 (RSVCE)

### Amnon and Tamar
1 Now Abʹsalom, David’s son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and after a time Amnon, David’s son, loved her.
2 And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.
3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonʹadab, the son of Shimʹe-ah, David’s brother; and Jonʹadab was a very crafty man.
4 And he said to him, “O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?” Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Abʹsalom’s sister.”
5 Jonʹadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed, and pretend to be ill; and when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.’ ”
6 So Amnon lay down, and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Pray let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”
7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”
8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, where he was lying down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
9 And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, “Send out every one from me.” So every one went out from him.
10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the cakes she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
11 But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.”
12 She answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me; for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this wanton folly.
13 As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the wanton fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.”
14 But he would not listen to her; and being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
15 Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone.”
16 But she said to him, “No, my brother; for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other which you did to me.” But he would not listen to her.
17 He called the young man who served him and said, “Put this woman out of my presence, and bolt the door after her.”
18 Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves; for thus were the virgin daughters of the king clad of old. So his servant put her out, and bolted the door after her.
19 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent the long robe which she wore; and she laid her hand on her head, and went away, crying aloud as she went.
20 And her brother Abʹsalom said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister; he is your brother; do not take this to heart.” So Tamar dwelt, a desolate woman, in her brother Abʹsalom’s house.
21 When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
22 But Abʹsalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Abʹsalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
### Absalom Avenges the Violation of His Sister
23 After two full years Abʹsalom had sheepshearers at Baʹal-haʹzor, which is near Eʹphraim, and Abʹsalom invited all the king’s sons.
24 And Abʹsalom came to the king, and said, “Behold, your servant has sheepshearers; pray let the king and his servants go with your servant.”
25 But the king said to Abʹsalom, “No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.” He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing.
26 Then Abʹsalom said, “If not, pray let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”
27 But Abʹsalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
28 Then Abʹsalom commanded his servants, “Mark when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Fear not; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.”
29 So the servants of Abʹsalom did to Amnon as Abʹsalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.
30 While they were on the way, tidings came to David, “Abʹsalom has slain all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left.”
31 Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants who were standing by rent their garments.
32 But Jonʹadab the son of Shimʹe-ah, David’s brother, said, “Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons, for Amnon alone is dead, for by the command of Abʹsalom this has been determined from the day he forced his sister Tamar.
33 Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon alone is dead.”
34 But Abʹsalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the Horonaʹim road by the side of the mountain.
35 And Jonʹadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about.”
36 And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.
37 But Abʹsalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammiʹhud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day.
38 So Abʹsalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
39 And the spirit of the king longed to go forth to Abʹsalom; for he was comforted about Amnon, seeing he was dead.


# Liber Secundus Samuelis, Quem Nos Secundum Regum Dicimus 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem post hæc ut Absalom filii David sororem speciosissimam, vocabulo Thamar, adamaret Amnon filius David,
2 et deperiret eam valde, ita ut propter amorem ejus ægrotaret: quia cum esset virgo, difficile ei videbatur ut quippiam inhoneste ageret cum ea.
3 Erat autem Amnon amicus nomine Jonadab, filius Semmaa fratris David, vir prudens valde.
4 Qui dixit ad eum: Quare sic attenuaris macie, fili regis, per singulos dies? cur non indicas mihi? Dixitque ei Amnon: Thamar sororem fratris mei Absalom amo.

5 Cui respondit Jonadab: Cuba super lectum tuum, et languorem simula: cumque venerit pater tuus ut visitet te, dic ei: Veniat, oro, Thamar soror mea, ut det mihi cibum, et faciat pulmentum, ut comedam de manu ejus.
6 Accubuit itaque Amnon, et quasi ægrotare cœpit: cumque venisset rex ad visitandum eum, ait Amnon ad regem: Veniat, obsecro, Thamar soror mea, ut faciat in oculis meis duas sorbitiunculas, et cibum capiam de manu ejus.
7 Misit ergo David ad Thamar domum, dicens: Veni in domum Amnon fratris tui, et fac ei pulmentum.
8 Venitque Thamar in domum Amnon fratris sui: ille autem jacebat. Quæ tollens farinam commiscuit, et liquefaciens, in oculis ejus coxit sorbitiunculas.
9 Tollensque quod coxerat, effudit, et posuit coram eo, et noluit comedere: dixitque Amnon: Ejicite universos a me. Cumque ejecissent omnes,
10 dixit Amnon ad Thamar: Infer cibum in conclave, ut vescar de manu tua. Tulit ergo Thamar sorbitiunculas quas fecerat, et intulit ad Amnon fratrem suum in conclave.
11 Cumque obtulisset ei cibum, apprehendit eam, et ait: Veni, cuba mecum, soror mea.
12 Quæ respondit ei: Noli frater mi, noli opprimere me: neque enim hoc fas est in Israël: noli facere stultitiam hanc.
13 Ego enim ferre non potero opprobrium meum, et tu eris quasi unus de insipientibus in Israël: quin potius loquere ad regem, et non negabit me tibi.
14 Noluit autem acquiescere precibus ejus, sed prævalens viribus oppressit eam, et cubavit cum ea.

15 Et exosam eam habuit Amnon odio magno nimis: ita ut majus esset odium quo oderat eam, amore quo ante dilexerat. Dixitque ei Amnon: Surge, et vade.
16 Quæ respondit ei: Majus est hoc malum quod nunc agis adversum me, quam quod ante fecisti, expellens me. Et noluit audire eam:
17 sed vocato puero qui ministrabat ei, dixit: Ejice hanc a me foras, et claude ostium post eam.
18 Quæ induta erat talari tunica: hujuscemodi enim filiæ regis virgines vestibus utebantur. Ejecit itaque eam minister illius foras: clausitque fores post eam.
19 Quæ aspergens cinerem capiti suo, scissa talari tunica, impositisque manibus super caput suum, ibat ingrediens, et clamans.
20 Dixit autem ei Absalom frater suus: Numquid Amnon frater tuus concubuit tecum? sed nunc soror, tace: frater tuus est: neque affligas cor tuum pro hac re. Mansit itaque Thamar contabescens in domo Absalom fratris sui.
21 Cum autem audisset rex David verba hæc, contristatus est valde: et noluit contristare spiritum Amnon filii sui, quoniam diligebat eum, quia primogenitus erat ei.
22 Porro non est locutus Absalom ad Amnon nec malum nec bonum: oderat enim Absalom Amnon, eo quod violasset Thamar sororem suam.

23 Factum est autem post tempus biennii ut tonderentur oves Absalom in Baalhasor, quæ est juxta Ephraim: et vocavit Absalom omnes filios regis,
24 venitque ad regem, et ait ad eum: Ecce tondentur oves servi tui: veniat, oro, rex cum servis suis ad servum suum.
25 Dixitque rex ad Absalom: Noli fili mi, noli rogare ut veniamus omnes et gravemus te. Cum autem cogeret eum, et noluisset ire, benedixit ei.
26 Et ait Absalom: Si non vis venire, veniat, obsecro, nobiscum saltem Amnon frater meus. Dixitque ad eum rex: Non est necesse ut vadat tecum.
27 Coëgit itaque Absalom eum, et dimisit cum eo Amnon et universos filios regis. Feceratque Absalom convivium quasi convivium regis.
28 Præceperat autem Absalom pueris suis, dicens: Observate cum temulentus fuerit Amnon vino, et dixero vobis: Percutite eum, et interficite: nolite timere: ego enim sum qui præcipio vobis: roboramini, et estote viri fortes.
29 Fecerunt ergo pueri Absalom adversum Amnon sicut præceperat eis Absalom. Surgentesque omnes filii regis ascenderunt singuli mulas suas, et fugerunt.

30 Cumque adhuc pergerent in itinere, fama pervenit ad David, dicens: Percussit Absalom omnes filios regis, et non remansit ex eis saltem unus.
31 Surrexit itaque rex, et scidit vestimenta sua, et cecidit super terram: et omnes servi illius qui assistebant ei, sciderunt vestimenta sua.
32 Respondens autem Jonadab filius Semmaa fratris David, dixit: Ne æstimet dominus meus rex quod omnes pueri filii regis occisi sint: Amnon solus mortuus est, quoniam in ore Absalom erat positus ex die qua oppressit Thamar sororem ejus.
33 Nunc ergo ne ponat dominus meus rex super cor suum verbum istud, dicens: Omnes filii regis occisi sunt: quoniam Amnon solus mortuus est.

34 Fugit autem Absalom. Et elevavit puer speculator oculos suos, et aspexit: et ecce populus multus veniebat per iter devium ex latere montis.
35 Dixit autem Jonadab ad regem: Ecce filii regis adsunt: juxta verbum servi tui, sic factum est.
36 Cumque cessasset loqui, apparuerunt et filii regis: et intrantes levaverunt vocem suam, et fleverunt: sed et rex et omnes servi ejus fleverunt ploratu magno nimis.
37 Porro Absalom fugiens abiit ad Tholomai filium Ammiud regem Gessur. Luxit ergo David filium suum cunctis diebus.
38 Absalom autem cum fugisset, et venisset in Gessur, fuit ibi tribus annis.
39 Cessavitque rex David persequi Absalom, eo quod consolatus esset super Amnon interitu.

1 καὶ ἐγενήθη μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ τῷ Αβεσσαλωμ υἱῷ Δαυιδ ἀδελφὴ καλὴ τῷ εἴδει σφόδρα καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῇ Θημαρ καὶ ἠγάπησεν αὐτὴν Αμνων υἱὸς Δαυιδ
2 καὶ ἐθλίβετο Αμνων ὥστε ἀρρωστεῖν διὰ Θημαρ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτοῦ ὅτι παρθένος ἦν αὐτή καὶ ὑπέρογκον ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Αμνων τοῦ ποιῆσαί τι αὐτῇ
3 καὶ ἦν τῷ Αμνων ἑταῖρος καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Ιωναδαβ υἱὸς Σαμαα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ Δαυιδ καὶ Ιωναδαβ ἀνὴρ σοφὸς σφόδρα
4 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τί σοι ὅτι σὺ οὕτως ἀσθενής υἱὲ τοῦ βασιλέως τὸ πρωὶ πρωί οὐκ ἀπαγγελεῖς μοι καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Αμνων Θημαρ τὴν ἀδελφὴν Αβεσσαλωμ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου ἐγὼ ἀγαπῶ

5 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ιωναδαβ κοιμήθητι ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης σου καὶ μαλακίσθητι καὶ εἰσελεύσεται ὁ πατήρ σου τοῦ ἰδεῖν σε καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτόν ἐλθέτω δὴ Θημαρ ἡ ἀδελφή μου καὶ ψωμισάτω με καὶ ποιησάτω κα{T'} ὀφθαλμούς μου βρῶμα ὅπως ἴδω καὶ φάγω ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῆς
6 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Αμνων καὶ ἠρρώστησεν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἰδεῖν αὐτόν καὶ εἶπεν Αμνων πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἐλθέτω δὴ Θημαρ ἡ ἀδελφή μου πρός με καὶ κολλυρισάτω ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου δύο κολλυρίδας καὶ φάγομαι ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτῆς
7 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Θημαρ εἰς τὸν οἶκον λέγων πορεύθητι δὴ εἰς τὸν οἶκον Αμνων τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου καὶ ποίησον αὐτῷ βρῶμα
8 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Θημαρ εἰς τὸν οἶκον Αμνων ἀδελφοῦ αὐτῆς καὶ αὐτὸς κοιμώμενος καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸ σταῖς καὶ ἐφύρασεν καὶ ἐκολλύρισεν κα{T'} ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἥψησεν τὰς κολλυρίδας
9 καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸ τήγανον καὶ κατεκένωσεν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν φαγεῖν καὶ εἶπεν Αμνων ἐξαγάγετε πάντα ἄνδρα ἐπάνωθέν μου καὶ ἐξήγαγον πάντα ἄνδρα ἀπὸ ἐπάνωθεν αὐτοῦ
10 καὶ εἶπεν Αμνων πρὸς Θημαρ εἰσένεγκε τὸ βρῶμα εἰς τὸ ταμίειον καὶ φάγομαι ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου καὶ ἔλαβεν Θημαρ τὰς κολλυρίδας ἃς ἐποίησεν καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν τῷ Αμνων ἀδελφῷ αὐτῆς εἰς τὸν κοιτῶνα
11 καὶ προσήγαγεν αὐτῷ τοῦ φαγεῖν καὶ ἐπελάβετο αὐτῆς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ δεῦρο κοιμήθητι με{T'} ἐμοῦ ἀδελφή μου
12 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ μή ἄδελφέ μου μὴ ταπεινώσῃς με διότι οὐ ποιηθήσεται οὕτως ἐν Ισραηλ μὴ ποιήσῃς τὴν ἀφροσύνην ταύτην
13 καὶ ἐγὼ ποῦ ἀποίσω τὸ ὄνειδός μου καὶ σὺ ἔσῃ ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀφρόνων ἐν Ισραηλ καὶ νῦν λάλησον δὴ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ὅτι οὐ μὴ κωλύσῃ με ἀπὸ σοῦ
14 καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν Αμνων τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῆς καὶ ἐκραταίωσεν ὑπὲρ αὐτὴν καὶ ἐταπείνωσεν αὐτὴν καὶ ἐκοιμήθη με{T'} αὐτῆς

15 καὶ ἐμίσησεν αὐτὴν Αμνων μῖσος μέγα σφόδρα ὅτι μέγα τὸ μῖσος ὃ ἐμίσησεν αὐτήν ὑπὲρ τὴν ἀγάπην ἣν ἠγάπησεν αὐτήν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Αμνων ἀνάστηθι καὶ πορεύου
16 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Θημαρ μή ἄδελφε ὅτι μεγάλη ἡ κακία ἡ ἐσχάτη ὑπὲρ τὴν πρώτην ἣν ἐποίησας με{T'} ἐμοῦ τοῦ ἐξαποστεῖλαί με καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν Αμνων ἀκοῦσαι τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῆς
17 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ τὸν προεστηκότα τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἐξαποστείλατε δὴ ταύτην ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ ἔξω καὶ ἀπόκλεισον τὴν θύραν ὀπίσω αὐτῆς
18 καὶ ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς ἦν χιτὼν καρπωτός ὅτι οὕτως ἐνεδιδύσκοντο αἱ θυγατέρες τοῦ βασιλέως αἱ παρθένοι τοὺς ἐπενδύτας αὐτῶν καὶ ἐξήγαγεν αὐτὴν ὁ λειτουργὸς αὐτοῦ ἔξω καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν τὴν θύραν ὀπίσω αὐτῆς
19 καὶ ἔλαβεν Θημαρ σποδὸν καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῆς καὶ τὸν χιτῶνα τὸν καρπωτὸν τὸν ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς διέρρηξεν καὶ ἐπέθηκεν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῆς καὶ ἐπορεύθη πορευομένη καὶ κράζουσα
20 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὴν Αβεσσαλωμ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτῆς μὴ Αμνων ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἐγένετο μετὰ σοῦ καὶ νῦν ἀδελφή μου κώφευσον ὅτι ἀδελφός σού ἐστιν μὴ θῇς τὴν καρδίαν σου τοῦ λαλῆσαι εἰς τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο καὶ ἐκάθισεν Θημαρ χηρεύουσα ἐν οἴκῳ Αβεσσαλωμ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτῆς
21 καὶ ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυιδ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ ἐθυμώθη σφόδρα καὶ οὐκ ἐλύπησεν τὸ πνεῦμα Αμνων τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἠγάπα αὐτόν ὅτι πρωτότοκος αὐτοῦ ἦν
22 καὶ οὐκ ἐλάλησεν Αβεσσαλωμ μετὰ Αμνων ἀπὸ πονηροῦ ἕως ἀγαθοῦ ὅτι ἐμίσει Αβεσσαλωμ τὸν Αμνων ἐπὶ λόγου οὗ ἐταπείνωσεν Θημαρ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτοῦ

23 καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς διετηρίδα ἡμερῶν καὶ ἦσαν κείροντες τῷ Αβεσσαλωμ ἐν Βελασωρ τῇ ἐχόμενα Εφραιμ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Αβεσσαλωμ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως
24 καὶ ἦλθεν Αβεσσαλωμ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ δὴ κείρουσιν τῷ δούλῳ σου πορευθήτω δὴ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ μετὰ τοῦ δούλου σου
25 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Αβεσσαλωμ μὴ δή υἱέ μου μὴ πορευθῶμεν πάντες ἡμεῖς καὶ οὐ μὴ καταβαρυνθῶμεν ἐπὶ σέ καὶ ἐβιάσατο αὐτόν καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν τοῦ πορευθῆναι καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτόν
26 καὶ εἶπεν Αβεσσαλωμ καὶ εἰ μή πορευθήτω δὴ με{Q'} ἡμῶν Αμνων ὁ ἀδελφός μου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς ἵνα τί πορευθῇ μετὰ σοῦ
27 καὶ ἐβιάσατο αὐτὸν Αβεσσαλωμ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν με{T'} αὐτοῦ τὸν Αμνων καὶ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐποίησεν Αβεσσαλωμ πότον κατὰ τὸν πότον τοῦ βασιλέως
28 καὶ ἐνετείλατο Αβεσσαλωμ τοῖς παιδαρίοις αὐτοῦ λέγων ἴδετε ὡς ἂν ἀγαθυνθῇ ἡ καρδία Αμνων ἐν τῷ οἴνῳ καὶ εἴπω πρὸς ὑμᾶς πατάξατε τὸν Αμνων καὶ θανατώσατε αὐτόν μὴ φοβηθῆτε ὅτι οὐχὶ ἐγώ εἰμι ἐντέλλομαι ὑμῖν ἀνδρίζεσθε καὶ γίνεσθε εἰς υἱοὺς δυνάμεως
29 καὶ ἐποίησαν τὰ παιδάρια Αβεσσαλωμ τῷ Αμνων καθὰ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς Αβεσσαλωμ καὶ ἀνέστησαν πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐπεκάθισαν ἀνὴρ ἐπὶ τὴν ἡμίονον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφυγαν

30 καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῶν ὄντων ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ἡ ἀκοὴ ἦλθεν πρὸς Δαυιδ λέγων ἐπάταξεν Αβεσσαλωμ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ εἷς
31 καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ διέρρηξεν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ οἱ περιεστῶτες αὐτῷ διέρρηξαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν
32 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ιωναδαβ υἱὸς Σαμαα ἀδελφοῦ Δαυιδ καὶ εἶπεν μὴ εἰπάτω ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς ὅτι πάντα τὰ παιδάρια τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως ἐθανάτωσεν ὅτι Αμνων μονώτατος ἀπέθανεν ὅτι ἐπὶ στόματος Αβεσσαλωμ ἦν κείμενος ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἐταπείνωσεν Θημαρ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτοῦ
33 καὶ νῦν μὴ θέσθω ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ῥῆμα λέγων πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως ἀπέθαναν ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ Αμνων μονώτατος ἀπέθανεν

34 καὶ ἀπέδρα Αβεσσαλωμ καὶ ἦρεν τὸ παιδάριον ὁ σκοπὸς τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶδεν καὶ ἰδοὺ λαὸς πολὺς πορευόμενος ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ ἐκ πλευρᾶς τοῦ ὄρους ἐν τῇ καταβάσει καὶ παρεγένετο ὁ σκοπὸς καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ εἶπεν ἄνδρας ἑώρακα ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ τῆς Ωρωνην ἐκ μέρους τοῦ ὄρους
35 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωναδαβ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἰδοὺ οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως πάρεισιν κατὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ δούλου σου οὕτως ἐγένετο
36 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα συνετέλεσεν λαλῶν καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως ἦλθαν καὶ ἐπῆραν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκλαυσαν καί γε ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἔκλαυσαν κλαυθμὸν μέγαν σφόδρα
37 καὶ Αβεσσαλωμ ἔφυγεν καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς Θολμαι υἱὸν Εμιουδ βασιλέα Γεδσουρ εἰς γῆν Μαχαδ καὶ ἐπένθησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυιδ ἐπὶ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
38 καὶ Αβεσσαλωμ ἀπέδρα καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Γεδσουρ καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἔτη τρία
39 καὶ ἐκόπασεν τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ ἐξελθεῖν ὀπίσω Αβεσσαλωμ ὅτι παρεκλήθη ἐπὶ Αμνων ὅτι ἀπέθανεν
