# Second Book of Samuel 10 (RSVCE)

### The Ammonites and Arameans Are Defeated
1 After this the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
2 And David said, “I will deal loyally with Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent by his servants to console him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the Ammonites.
3 But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?”
4 So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off half the beard of each, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away.
5 When it was told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”
6 When the Ammonites saw that they had become odious to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-reʹhob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand foot soldiers, and the king of Maʹacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob, twelve thousand men.
7 And when David heard of it, he sent Joʹab and all the host of the mighty men.
8 And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate; and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maʹacah, were by themselves in the open country.
9 When Joʹab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the picked men of Israel, and arrayed them against the Syrians;
10 the rest of his men he put in the charge of Abiʹshai his brother, and he arrayed them against the Ammonites.
11 And he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
12 Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God; and may theLorddo what seems good to him.”
13 So Joʹab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Syrians; and they fled before him.
14 And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abiʹshai, and entered the city. Then Joʹab returned from fighting against the Ammonites, and came to Jerusalem.
15 But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.
16 And Hadadeʹzer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphraʹtes; and they came to Helam, with Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadeʹzer at their head.
17 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians arrayed themselves against David, and fought with him.
18 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and wounded Shobach the commander of their army, so that he died there.
19 And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadeʹzer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel, and became subject to them. So the Syrians feared to help the Ammonites any more.


# Liber Secundus Samuelis, Quem Nos Secundum Regum Dicimus 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem post hæc ut moreretur rex filiorum Ammon, et regnavit Hanon filius ejus pro eo.
2 Dixitque David: Faciam misericordiam cum Hanon filio Naas, sicut fecit pater ejus mecum misericordiam. Misit ergo David, consolans eum per servos suos super patris interitu. Cum autem venissent servi David in terram filiorum Ammon,
3 dixerunt principes filiorum Ammon ad Hanon dominum suum: Putas quod propter honorem patris tui miserit David ad te consolatores, et non ideo ut investigaret, et exploraret civitatem, et everteret eam, misit David servos suos ad te?
4 Tulit itaque Hanon servos David, rasitque dimidiam partem barbæ eorum et præscidit vestes eorum medias usque ad nates, et dimisit eos.
5 Quod cum nuntiatum esset David, misit in occursum eorum: erant enim viri confusi turpiter valde, et mandavit eis David: Manete in Jericho donec crescat barba vestra, et tunc revertimini.

6 Videntes autem filii Ammon quod injuriam fecissent David, miserunt, et conduxerunt mercede Syrum Rohob, et Syrum Soba, viginti millia peditum, et a rege Maacha mille viros, et ab Istob duodecim millia virorum.
7 Quod cum audisset David, misit Joab et omnem exercitum bellatorum.
8 Egressi sunt ergo filii Ammon, et direxerunt aciem ante ipsum introitum portæ: Syrus autem Soba, et Rohob, et Istob, et Maacha, seorsum erant in campo.
9 Videns igitur Joab quod præparatum esset adversum se prælium et ex adverso et post tergum, elegit ex omnibus electis Israël, et instruxit aciem contra Syrum:
10 reliquam autem partem populi tradidit Abisai fratri suo, qui direxit aciem adversus filios Ammon.
11 Et ait Joab: Si prævaluerint adversum me Syri, eris mihi in adjutorium: si autem filii Ammon prævaluerint adversum te, auxiliabor tibi.
12 Esto vir fortis, et pugnemus pro populo nostro et civitate Dei nostri: Dominus autem faciet quod bonum est in conspectu suo.
13 Iniit itaque Joab, et populus qui erat cum eo, certamen contra Syros: qui statim fugerunt a facie ejus.
14 Filii autem Ammon videntes quia fugissent Syri, fugerunt et ipsi a facie Abisai, et ingressi sunt civitatem: reversusque est Joab a filiis Ammon, et venit Jerusalem.

15 Videntes igitur Syri quoniam corruissent coram Israël, congregati sunt pariter.
16 Misitque Adarezer, et eduxit Syros qui erant trans fluvium, et adduxit eorum exercitum: Sobach autem, magister militiæ Adarezer, erat princeps eorum.
17 Quod cum nuntiatum esset David, contraxit omnem Israëlem, et transivit Jordanem, venitque in Helam: et direxerunt aciem Syri ex adverso David, et pugnaverunt contra eum.
18 Fugeruntque Syri a facie Israël, et occidit David de Syris septingentos currus, et quadraginta millia equitum: et Sobach principem militiæ percussit, qui statim mortuus est.
19 Videntes autem universi reges qui erant in præsidio Adarezer, se victos esse ab Israël, expaverunt, et fugerunt quinquaginta et octo millia coram Israël. Et fecerunt pacem cum Israël, et servierunt eis: timueruntque Syri auxilium præbere ultra filiis Ammon.


# Βασιλειῶν Βʹ 10 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἀπέθανεν βασιλεὺς υἱῶν Αμμων καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Αννων υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ ποιήσω ἔλεος μετὰ Αννων υἱοῦ Ναας ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ με{T'} ἐμοῦ ἔλεος καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δαυιδ παρακαλέσαι αὐτὸν ἐν χειρὶ τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ περὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ παρεγένοντο οἱ παῖδες Δαυιδ εἰς τὴν γῆν υἱῶν Αμμων
3 καὶ εἶπον οἱ ἄρχοντες υἱῶν Αμμων πρὸς Αννων τὸν κύριον αὐτῶν μὴ παρὰ τὸ δοξάζειν Δαυιδ τὸν πατέρα σου ἐνώπιόν σου ὅτι ἀπέστειλέν σοι παρακαλοῦντας ἀλ{L'} οὐχὶ ὅπως ἐρευνήσωσιν τὴν πόλιν καὶ κατασκοπήσωσιν αὐτὴν καὶ τοῦ κατασκέψασθαι αὐτὴν ἀπέστειλεν Δαυιδ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ πρὸς σέ
4 καὶ ἔλαβεν Αννων τοὺς παῖδας Δαυιδ καὶ ἐξύρησεν τοὺς πώγωνας αὐτῶν καὶ ἀπέκοψεν τοὺς μανδύας αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ ἡμίσει ἕως τῶν ἰσχίων αὐτῶν καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτούς
5 καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ Δαυιδ ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀνδρῶν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτῶν ὅτι ἦσαν οἱ ἄνδρες ἠτιμασμένοι σφόδρα καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς καθίσατε ἐν Ιεριχω ἕως τοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι τοὺς πώγωνας ὑμῶν καὶ ἐπιστραφήσεσθε

6 καὶ εἶδαν οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων ὅτι κατῃσχύνθησαν ὁ λαὸς Δαυιδ καὶ ἀπέστειλαν οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων καὶ ἐμισθώσαντο τὴν Συρίαν Βαιθροωβ εἴκοσι χιλιάδας πεζῶν καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Μααχα χιλίους ἄνδρας καὶ Ιστωβ δώδεκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν
7 καὶ ἤκουσεν Δαυιδ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τὸν Ιωαβ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν τοὺς δυνατούς
8 καὶ ἐξῆλθαν οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων καὶ παρετάξαντο πόλεμον παρὰ τῇ θύρᾳ τῆς πύλης καὶ Συρία Σουβα καὶ Ροωβ καὶ Ιστωβ καὶ Μααχα μόνοι ἐν ἀγρῷ
9 καὶ εἶδεν Ιωαβ ὅτι ἐγενήθη πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀντιπρόσωπον τοῦ πολέμου ἐκ τοῦ κατὰ πρόσωπον ἐξ ἐναντίας καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ὄπισθεν καὶ ἐπέλεξεν ἐκ πάντων τῶν νεανίσκων Ισραηλ καὶ παρετάξαντο ἐξ ἐναντίας Συρίας
10 καὶ τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ λαοῦ ἔδωκεν ἐν χειρὶ Αβεσσα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ παρετάξαντο ἐξ ἐναντίας υἱῶν Αμμων
11 καὶ εἶπεν ἐὰν κραταιωθῇ Συρία ὑπὲρ ἐμέ καὶ ἔσεσθέ μοι εἰς σωτηρίαν καὶ ἐὰν υἱοὶ Αμμων κραταιωθῶσιν ὑπὲρ σέ καὶ ἐσόμεθα τοῦ σῶσαί σε
12 ἀνδρίζου καὶ κραταιωθῶμεν ὑπὲρ τοῦ λαοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ περὶ τῶν πόλεων τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ κύριος ποιήσει τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ προσῆλθεν Ιωαβ καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἰς πόλεμον πρὸς Συρίαν καὶ ἔφυγαν ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων εἶδαν ὅτι ἔφυγεν Συρία καὶ ἔφυγαν ἀπὸ προσώπου Αβεσσα καὶ εἰσῆλθαν εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν Ιωαβ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Αμμων καὶ παρεγένοντο εἰς Ιερουσαλημ

15 καὶ εἶδεν Συρία ὅτι ἔπταισεν ἔμπροσθεν Ισραηλ καὶ συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό
16 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Αδρααζαρ καὶ συνήγαγεν τὴν Συρίαν τὴν ἐκ τοῦ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ Χαλαμακ καὶ παρεγένοντο Αιλαμ καὶ Σωβακ ἄρχων τῆς δυνάμεως Αδρααζαρ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν
17 καὶ ἀνηγγέλη τῷ Δαυιδ καὶ συνήγαγεν τὸν πάντα Ισραηλ καὶ διέβη τὸν Ιορδάνην καὶ παρεγένοντο εἰς Αιλαμ καὶ παρετάξατο Συρία ἀπέναντι Δαυιδ καὶ ἐπολέμησαν με{T'} αὐτοῦ
18 καὶ ἔφυγεν Συρία ἀπὸ προσώπου Ισραηλ καὶ ἀνεῖλεν Δαυιδ ἐκ τῆς Συρίας ἑπτακόσια ἅρματα καὶ τεσσαράκοντα χιλιάδας ἱππέων καὶ τὸν Σωβακ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ ἐπάταξεν καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ
19 καὶ εἶδαν πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς οἱ δοῦλοι Αδρααζαρ ὅτι ἔπταισαν ἔμπροσθεν Ισραηλ καὶ ηὐτομόλησαν μετὰ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐδούλευσαν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐφοβήθη Συρία τοῦ σῶσαι ἔτι τοὺς υἱοὺς Αμμων
