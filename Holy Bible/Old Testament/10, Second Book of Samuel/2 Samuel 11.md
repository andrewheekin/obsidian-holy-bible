# Second Book of Samuel 11 (RSVCE)

### David Commits Adultery with Bathsheba
1 In the spring of the year, the time when kings go forth to battle, David sent Joʹab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they ravaged the Ammonites, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.
2 It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking upon the roof of the king’s house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.
3 And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, “Is not this Bathsheʹba, the daughter of Eliʹam, the wife of Uriʹah the Hittite?”
4 So David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she was purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house.
5 And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, “I am with child.”
6 So David sent word to Joʹab, “Send me Uriʹah the Hittite.” And Joʹab sent Uriʹah to David.
7 When Uriʹah came to him, David asked how Joʹab was doing, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
8 Then David said to Uriʹah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” And Uriʹah went out of the king’s house, and there followed him a present from the king.
9 But Uriʹah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
10 When they told David, “Uriʹah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriʹah, “Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”
11 Uriʹah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths; and my lord Joʹab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field; shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.”
12 Then David said to Uriʹah, “Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriʹah remained in Jerusalem that day, and the next.
13 And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.
### David Has Uriah Killed
14 In the morning David wrote a letter to Joʹab, and sent it by the hand of Uriʹah.
15 In the letter he wrote, “Set Uriʹah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die.”
16 And as Joʹab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriʹah to the place where he knew there were valiant men.
17 And the men of the city came out and fought with Joʹab; and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriʹah the Hittite was slain also.
18 Then Joʹab sent and told David all the news about the fighting;
19 and he instructed the messenger, “When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king,
20 then, if the king’s anger rises, and if he says to you, ‘Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?
21 Who killed Abimʹelech the son of Jerubʹbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriʹah the Hittite is dead also.’ ”
22 So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joʹab had sent him to tell.
23 The messenger said to David, “The men gained an advantage over us, and came out against us in the field; but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.
24 Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall; some of the king’s servants are dead; and your servant Uriʹah the Hittite is dead also.”
25 David said to the messenger, “Thus shall you say to Joʹab, ‘Do not let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours now one and now another; strengthen your attack upon the city, and overthrow it.’ And encourage him.”
26 When the wife of Uriʹah heard that Uriʹah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.
27 And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased theLord.


# Liber Secundus Samuelis, Quem Nos Secundum Regum Dicimus 11 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem, vertente anno, eo tempore quo solent reges ad bella procedere, misit David Joab, et servos suos cum eo, et universum Israël, et vastaverunt filios Ammon, et obsederunt Rabba: David autem remansit in Jerusalem.
2 Dum hæc agerentur, accidit ut surgeret David de strato suo post meridiem, et deambularet in solario domus regiæ: viditque mulierem se lavantem ex adverso super solarium suum: erat autem mulier pulchra valde.
3 Misit ergo rex, et requisivit quæ esset mulier. Nuntiatumque est ei quod ipsa esset Bethsabee filia Eliam, uxor Uriæ Hethæi.
4 Missis itaque David nuntiis, tulit eam: quæ cum ingressa esset ad illum, dormivit cum ea: statimque sanctificata est ab immunditia sua,
5 et reversa est domum suam concepto fœtu. Mittensque nuntiavit David, et ait: Concepi.

6 Misit autem David ad Joab, dicens: Mitte ad me Uriam Hethæum. Misitque Joab Uriam ad David.
7 Et venit Urias ad David. Quæsivitque David quam recte ageret Joab et populus, et quomodo administraretur bellum.
8 Et dixit David ad Uriam: Vade in domum tuam, et lava pedes tuos. Et egressus est Urias de domo regis, secutusque est eum cibus regius.
9 Dormivit autem Urias ante portam domus regiæ cum aliis servis domini sui, et non descendit ad domum suam.
10 Nuntiatumque est David a dicentibus: Non ivit Urias in domum suam. Et ait David ad Uriam: Numquid non de via venisti? quare non descendisti in domum tuam?
11 Et ait Urias ad David: Arca Dei et Israël et Juda habitant in papilionibus, et dominus meus Joab et servi domini mei super faciem terræ manent: et ego ingrediar domum meam, ut comedam et bibam, et dormiam cum uxore mea? Per salutem tuam, et per salutem animæ tuæ, non faciam rem hanc.
12 Ait ergo David ad Uriam: Mane hic etiam hodie, et cras dimittam te. Mansit Urias in Jerusalem in die illa et altera:
13 et vocavit eum David ut comederet coram se et biberet, et inebriavit eum: qui egressus vespere, dormivit in strato suo cum servis domini sui, et in domum suam non descendit.

14 Factum est ergo mane, et scripsit David epistolam ad Joab: misitque per manum Uriæ,
15 scribens in epistola: Ponite Uriam ex adverso belli, ubi fortissimum est prælium: et derelinquite eum, ut percussus intereat.
16 Igitur cum Joab obsideret urbem, posuit Uriam in loco ubi sciebat viros esse fortissimos.
17 Egressique viri de civitate, bellabant adversum Joab, et ceciderunt de populo servorum David, et mortuus est etiam Urias Hethæus.
18 Misit itaque Joab, et nuntiavit David omnia verba prælii:
19 præcepitque nuntio, dicens: Cum compleveris universos sermones belli ad regem,
20 si eum videris indignari, et dixerit: Quare accessistis ad murum, ut præliaremini? an ignorabatis quod multa desuper ex muro tela mittantur?
21 Quis percussit Abimelech filium Jerobaal? nonne mulier misit super eum fragmen molæ de muro, et interfecit eum in Thebes? quare juxta murum accessistis? dices: Etiam servus tuus Urias Hethæus occubuit.

22 Abiit ergo nuntius, et venit, et narravit David omnia quæ ei præceperat Joab.
23 Et dixit nuntius ad David: Prævaluerunt adversum nos viri, et egressi sunt ad nos in agrum: nos autem facto impetu persecuti eos sumus usque ad portam civitatis.
24 Et direxerunt jacula sagittarii ad servos tuos ex muro desuper, mortuique sunt de servis regis: quin etiam servus tuus Urias Hethæus mortuus est.
25 Et dixit David ad nuntium: Hæc dices Joab: Non te frangat ista res: varius enim eventus est belli, nunc hunc, et nunc illum consumit gladius: conforta bellatores tuos adversus urbem ut destruas eam, et exhortare eos.

26 Audivit autem uxor Uriæ quod mortuus esset Urias vir suus, et planxit eum.
27 Transacto autem luctu, misit David, et introduxit eam in domum suam, et facta est ei uxor, peperitque ei filium: et displicuit verbum hoc quod fecerat David, coram Domino.


# Βασιλειῶν Βʹ 11 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπιστρέψαντος τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τῆς ἐξοδίας τῶν βασιλέων καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δαυιδ τὸν Ιωαβ καὶ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν πάντα Ισραηλ καὶ διέφθειραν τοὺς υἱοὺς Αμμων καὶ διεκάθισαν ἐπὶ Ραββαθ καὶ Δαυιδ ἐκάθισεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
2 καὶ ἐγένετο πρὸς ἑσπέραν καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυιδ ἀπὸ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ καὶ περιεπάτει ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ εἶδεν γυναῖκα λουομένην ἀπὸ τοῦ δώματος καὶ ἡ γυνὴ καλὴ τῷ εἴδει σφόδρα
3 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δαυιδ καὶ ἐζήτησεν τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ εἶπεν οὐχὶ αὕτη Βηρσαβεε θυγάτηρ Ελιαβ γυνὴ Ουριου τοῦ Χετταίου
4 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δαυιδ ἀγγέλους καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτήν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ ἐκοιμήθη με{T'} αὐτῆς καὶ αὐτὴ ἁγιαζομένη ἀπὸ ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτῆς καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτῆς
5 καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔλαβεν ἡ γυνή καὶ ἀποστείλασα ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ Δαυιδ καὶ εἶπεν ἐγώ εἰμι ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχω

6 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Ιωαβ λέγων ἀπόστειλον πρός με τὸν Ουριαν τὸν Χετταῖον καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιωαβ τὸν Ουριαν πρὸς Δαυιδ
7 καὶ παραγίνεται Ουριας καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν Δαυιδ εἰς εἰρήνην Ιωαβ καὶ εἰς εἰρήνην τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ εἰς εἰρήνην τοῦ πολέμου
8 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ τῷ Ουρια κατάβηθι εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου καὶ νίψαι τοὺς πόδας σου καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ουριας ἐξ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ ἄρσις τοῦ βασιλέως
9 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ουριας παρὰ τῇ θύρᾳ τοῦ βασιλέως μετὰ τῶν δούλων τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐ κατέβη εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ
10 καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ Δαυιδ λέγοντες ὅτι οὐ κατέβη Ουριας εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Ουριαν οὐχὶ ἐξ ὁδοῦ σὺ ἔρχῃ τί ὅτι οὐ κατέβης εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου
11 καὶ εἶπεν Ουριας πρὸς Δαυιδ ἡ κιβωτὸς καὶ Ισραηλ καὶ Ιουδας κατοικοῦσιν ἐν σκηναῖς καὶ ὁ κύριός μου Ιωαβ καὶ οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ κυρίου μου ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἀγροῦ παρεμβάλλουσιν καὶ ἐγὼ εἰσελεύσομαι εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν καὶ κοιμηθῆναι μετὰ τῆς γυναικός μου πῶς ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου εἰ ποιήσω τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο
12 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Ουριαν κάθισον ἐνταῦθα καί γε σήμερον καὶ αὔριον ἐξαποστελῶ σε καὶ ἐκάθισεν Ουριας ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ τῇ ἐπαύριον
13 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν Δαυιδ καὶ ἔφαγεν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔπιεν καὶ ἐμέθυσεν αὐτόν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἑσπέρας τοῦ κοιμηθῆναι ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν δούλων τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ οὐ κατέβη

14 καὶ ἐγένετο πρωὶ καὶ ἔγραψεν Δαυιδ βιβλίον πρὸς Ιωαβ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἐν χειρὶ Ουριου
15 καὶ ἔγραψεν ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ λέγων εἰσάγαγε τὸν Ουριαν ἐξ ἐναντίας τοῦ πολέμου τοῦ κραταιοῦ καὶ ἀποστραφήσεσθε ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ καὶ πληγήσεται καὶ ἀποθανεῖται
16 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ φυλάσσειν Ιωαβ ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἔθηκεν τὸν Ουριαν εἰς τὸν τόπον οὗ ᾔδει ὅτι ἄνδρες δυνάμεως ἐκεῖ
17 καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐπολέμουν μετὰ Ιωαβ καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ ἐκ τῶν δούλων Δαυιδ καὶ ἀπέθανεν καί γε Ουριας ὁ Χετταῖος
18 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιωαβ καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ βασιλεῖ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ πολέμου
19 καὶ ἐνετείλατο τῷ ἀγγέλῳ λέγων ἐν τῷ συντελέσαι σε πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ πολέμου λαλῆσαι πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα
20 καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν ἀναβῇ ὁ θυμὸς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ εἴπῃ σοι τί ὅτι ἠγγίσατε πρὸς τὴν πόλιν πολεμῆσαι οὐκ ᾔδειτε ὅτι τοξεύσουσιν ἀπάνωθεν τοῦ τείχους
21 τίς ἐπάταξεν τὸν Αβιμελεχ υἱὸν Ιεροβααλ οὐχὶ γυνὴ ἔρριψεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν κλάσμα μύλου ἐπάνωθεν τοῦ τείχους καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐν Θαμασι ἵνα τί προσηγάγετε πρὸς τὸ τεῖχος καὶ ἐρεῖς καί γε Ουριας ὁ δοῦλός σου ὁ Χετταῖος ἀπέθανεν

22 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ ἄγγελος Ιωαβ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα εἰς Ιερουσαλημ καὶ παρεγένετο καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ Δαυιδ πάντα ὅσα ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ Ιωαβ πάντα τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ πολέμου καὶ ἐθυμώθη Δαυιδ πρὸς Ιωαβ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον ἵνα τί προσηγάγετε πρὸς τὴν πόλιν τοῦ πολεμῆσαι οὐκ ᾔδειτε ὅτι πληγήσεσθε ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους τίς ἐπάταξεν τὸν Αβιμελεχ υἱὸν Ιεροβααλ οὐχὶ γυνὴ ἔρριψεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν κλάσμα μύλου ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐν Θαμασι ἵνα τί προσηγάγετε πρὸς τὸ τεῖχος
23 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος πρὸς Δαυιδ ὅτι ἐκραταίωσαν ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς οἱ ἄνδρες καὶ ἐξῆλθαν ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς εἰς τὸν ἀγρόν καὶ ἐγενήθημεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ἕως τῆς θύρας τῆς πύλης
24 καὶ ἐτόξευσαν οἱ τοξεύοντες πρὸς τοὺς παῖδάς σου ἀπάνωθεν τοῦ τείχους καὶ ἀπέθαναν τῶν παίδων τοῦ βασιλέως καί γε ὁ δοῦλός σου Ουριας ὁ Χετταῖος ἀπέθανεν
25 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον τάδε ἐρεῖς πρὸς Ιωαβ μὴ πονηρὸν ἔστω ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ὅτι ποτὲ μὲν οὕτως καὶ ποτὲ οὕτως φάγεται ἡ μάχαιρα κραταίωσον τὸν πόλεμόν σου πρὸς τὴν πόλιν καὶ κατάσπασον αὐτὴν καὶ κραταίωσον αὐτόν

26 καὶ ἤκουσεν ἡ γυνὴ Ουριου ὅτι ἀπέθανεν Ουριας ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς καὶ ἐκόψατο τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς
27 καὶ διῆλθεν τὸ πένθος καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δαυιδ καὶ συνήγαγεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα καὶ ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ υἱόν καὶ πονηρὸν ἐφάνη τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐποίησεν Δαυιδ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου
