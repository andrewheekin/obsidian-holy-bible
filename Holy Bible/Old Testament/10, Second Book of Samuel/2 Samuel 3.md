# Second Book of Samuel 3 (RSVCE)

### Abner Defects to David
1 There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.
2 And sons were born to David at Hebron: his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinʹo-am of Jezreʹel;
3 and his second, Chilʹe-ab, of Abʹigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Abʹsalom the son of Maʹacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
4 and the fourth, Adoniʹjah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiʹah the son of Abiʹtal;
5 and the sixth, Ithʹre-am, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
6 While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.
7 Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiʹah; and Ish-boʹsheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”
8 Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-boʹsheth, and said, “Am I a dog’s head of Judah? This day I keep showing loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman.
9 God do so to Abner and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what theLordhas sworn to him,
10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beer-sheba.”
11 And Ish-boʹsheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
12 And Abner sent messengers to David at Hebron, saying, “To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you.”
13 And he said, “Good; I will make a covenant with you; but one thing I require of you; that is, you shall not see my face, unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.”
14 Then David sent messengers to Ish-boʹsheth Saul’s son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed at the price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”
15 And Ish-boʹsheth sent, and took her from her husband Palʹti-el the son of Laʹish.
16 But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahuʹrim. Then Abner said to him, “Go, return”; and he returned.
17 And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, “For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you.
18 Now then bring it about; for theLordhas promised David, saying, ‘By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.’ ”
19 Abner also spoke to Benjamin; and then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.
20 When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
21 And Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
### Abner Is Killed by Joab
22 Just then the servants of David arrived with Joʹab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
23 When Joʹab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joʹab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace.”
24 Then Joʹab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone?
25 You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.”
26 When Joʹab came out from David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah; but David did not know about it.
27 And when Abner returned to Hebron, Joʹab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he smote him in the belly, so that he died, for the blood of Asʹahel his brother.
28 Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, “I and my kingdom are for ever guiltless before theLordfor the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
29 May it fall upon the head of Joʹab, and upon all his father’s house; and may the house of Joʹab never be without one who has a discharge, or who is leprous, or who holds a spindle, or who is slain by the sword, or who lacks bread!”
30 So Joʹab and Abiʹshai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asʹahel in the battle at Gibeon.
31 Then David said to Joʹab and to all the people who were with him, “Rend your clothes, and gird on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David followed the bier.
32 They buried Abner at Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
33 And the king lamented for Abner, saying, “Should Abner die as a fool dies?
34 Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered; as one falls before the wicked you have fallen.” And all the people wept again over him.
35 Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, “God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!”
36 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as everything that the king did pleased all the people.
37 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king’s will to slay Abner the son of Ner.
38 And the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
39 And I am this day weak, though anointed king; these men the sons of Zeruʹiah are too hard for me. TheLordrequite the evildoer according to his wickedness!”


# Liber Secundus Samuelis, Quem Nos Secundum Regum Dicimus 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Facta est ergo longa concertatio inter domum Saul et inter domum David: David proficiscens, et semper seipso robustior, domus autem Saul decrescens quotidie.
2 Natique sunt filii David in Hebron: fuitque primogenitus ejus Amnon, de Achinoam Jezraëlitide.
3 Et post eum Cheleab, de Abigail uxore Nabal Carmeli: porro tertius Absalom, filius Maacha filiæ Tholmai regis Gessur.
4 Quartus autem Adonias, filius Haggith: et quintus Saphathia, filius Abital.
5 Sextus quoque Jethraam, de Egla uxore David: hi nati sunt David in Hebron.

6 Cum ergo esset prælium inter domum Saul et domum David, Abner filius Ner regebat domum Saul.
7 Fuerat autem Sauli concubina nomine Respha, filia Aja. Dixitque Isboseth ad Abner:
8 Quare ingressus es ad concubinam patris mei? Qui iratus nimis propter verba Isboseth, ait: Numquid caput canis ego sum adversum Judam hodie, qui fecerim misericordiam super domum Saul patris tui, et super fratres et proximos ejus, et non tradidi te in manus David, et tu requisisti in me quod argueres pro muliere hodie?
9 Hæc faciat Deus Abner, et hæc addat ei, nisi quomodo juravit Dominus David, sic faciam cum eo,
10 ut transferatur regnum de domo Saul, et elevetur thronus David super Israël et super Judam, a Dan usque Bersabee.
11 Et non potuit respondere ei quidquam, quia metuebat illum.

12 Misit ergo Abner nuntios ad David pro se dicentes: Cujus est terra? et ut loquerentur: Fac mecum amicitias, et erit manus mea tecum, et reducam ad te universum Israël.
13 Qui ait: Optime: ego faciam tecum amicitias: sed unam rem peto a te, dicens: Non videbis faciem meam antequam adduxeris Michol filiam Saul: et sic venies, et videbis me.
14 Misit autem David nuntios ad Isboseth filium Saul, dicens: Redde uxorem meam Michol, quam despondi mihi centum præputiis Philisthiim.
15 Misit ergo Isboseth, et tulit eam a viro suo Phaltiel filio Lais.
16 Sequebaturque eam vir suus, plorans usque Bahurim: et dixit ad eum Abner: Vade, et revertere. Qui reversus est.
17 Sermonem quoque intulit Abner ad seniores Israël, dicens: Tam heri quam nudiustertius quærebatis David ut regnaret super vos.
18 Nunc ergo facite: quoniam Dominus locutus est ad David, dicens: In manu servi mei David salvabo populum meum Israël de manu Philisthiim, et omnium inimicorum ejus.
19 Locutus est autem Abner etiam ad Benjamin. Et abiit ut loqueretur ad David in Hebron omnia quæ placuerant Israëli et universo Benjamin.
20 Venitque ad David in Hebron cum viginti viris: et fecit David Abner, et viris ejus qui venerant cum eo, convivium.
21 Et dixit Abner ad David: Surgam, ut congregem ad te dominum meum regem omnem Israël, et ineam tecum fœdus, et imperes omnibus, sicut desiderat anima tua. Cum ergo deduxisset David Abner, et ille isset in pace,

22 statim pueri David et Joab venerunt, cæsis latronibus, cum præda magna nimis: Abner autem non erat cum David in Hebron, quia jam dimiserat eum, et profectus fuerat in pace.
23 Et Joab, et omnis exercitus qui erat cum eo, postea venerunt: nuntiatum est itaque Joab a narrantibus: Venit Abner filius Ner ad regem, et dimisit eum, et abiit in pace.
24 Et ingressus est Joab ad regem, et ait: Quid fecisti? Ecce venit Abner ad te: quare dimisisti eum, et abiit et recessit?
25 ignoras Abner filium Ner, quoniam ad hoc venit ad te ut deciperet te, et sciret exitum tuum et introitum tuum, et nosset omnia quæ agis?
26 Egressus itaque Joab a David, misit nuntios post Abner, et reduxit eum a cisterna Sira, ignorante David.
27 Cumque rediisset Abner in Hebron, seorsum adduxit eum Joab ad medium portæ ut loqueretur ei, in dolo: et percussit illum ibi in inguine, et mortuus est in ultionem sanguinis Asaël fratris ejus.
28 Quod cum audisset David rem jam gestam, ait: Mundus ego sum, et regnum meum apud Dominum usque in sempiternum, a sanguine Abner filii Ner:
29 et veniat super caput Joab, et super omnem domum patris ejus: nec deficiat de domo Joab fluxum seminis sustinens, et leprosus, et tenens fusum, et cadens gladio, et indigens pane.

30 Igitur Joab et Abisai frater ejus interfecerunt Abner, eo quod occidisset Asaël fratrem eorum in Gabaon in prælio.
31 Dixit autem David ad Joab, et ad omnem populum qui erat cum eo: Scindite vestimenta vestra, et accingimini saccis, et plangite ante exequias Abner. Porro rex David sequebatur feretrum.
32 Cumque sepelissent Abner in Hebron, levavit rex David vocem suam, et flevit super tumulum Abner: flevit autem et omnis populus.
33 Plangensque rex, et lugens Abner, ait:Nequaquam ut mori solent ignavi, mortuus est Abner.
34 Manus tuæ ligatæ non sunt,et pedes tui non sunt compedibus aggravati:sed sicut solent cadere coram filiis iniquitatis, sic corruisti.Congeminansque omnis populus flevit super eum.
35 Cumque venisset universa multitudo cibum capere cum David, clara adhuc die juravit David, dicens: Hæc faciat mihi Deus, et hæc addat, si ante occasum solis gustavero panem vel aliud quidquam.
36 Omnisque populus audivit, et placuerunt eis cuncta quæ fecit rex in conspectu totius populi.
37 Et cognovit omne vulgus et universus Israël in die illa, quoniam non actum fuisset a rege ut occideretur Abner filius Ner.
38 Dixit quoque rex ad servos suos: Num ignoratis quoniam princeps et maximus cecidit hodie in Israël?
39 Ego autem adhuc delicatus, et unctus rex: porro viri isti filii Sarviæ duri sunt mihi: retribuat Dominus facienti malum juxta malitiam suam.

8 καὶ ἐθυμώθη σφόδρα Αβεννηρ περὶ τοῦ λόγου Μεμφιβοσθε καὶ εἶπεν Αβεννηρ πρὸς αὐτόν μὴ κεφαλὴ κυνὸς ἐγώ εἰμι ἐποίησα ἔλεος σήμερον μετὰ τοῦ οἴκου Σαουλ τοῦ πατρός σου καὶ περὶ ἀδελφῶν καὶ γνωρίμων καὶ οὐκ ηὐτομόλησα εἰς τὸν οἶκον Δαυιδ καὶ ἐπιζητεῖς ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ ὑπὲρ ἀδικίας γυναικὸς σήμερον
9 τάδε ποιήσαι ὁ θεὸς τῷ Αβεννηρ καὶ τάδε προσθείη αὐτῷ ὅτι καθὼς ὤμοσεν κύριος τῷ Δαυιδ ὅτι οὕτως ποιήσω αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ
10 περιελεῖν τὴν βασιλείαν ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Σαουλ καὶ τοῦ ἀναστῆσαι τὸν θρόνον Δαυιδ ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Ιουδαν ἀπὸ Δαν ἕως Βηρσαβεε
11 καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνάσθη ἔτι Μεμφιβοσθε ἀποκριθῆναι τῷ Αβεννηρ ῥῆμα ἀπὸ τοῦ φοβεῖσθαι αὐτόν

12 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Αβεννηρ ἀγγέλους πρὸς Δαυιδ εἰς Θαιλαμ οὗ ἦν παραχρῆμα λέγων διάθου διαθήκην σου με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ χείρ μου μετὰ σοῦ τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς σὲ πάντα τὸν οἶκον Ισραηλ
13 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ ἐγὼ καλῶς διαθήσομαι πρὸς σὲ διαθήκην πλὴν λόγον ἕνα ἐγὼ αἰτοῦμαι παρὰ σοῦ λέγων οὐκ ὄψει τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐὰν μὴ ἀγάγῃς τὴν Μελχολ θυγατέρα Σαουλ παραγινομένου σου ἰδεῖν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου
14 καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Μεμφιβοσθε υἱὸν Σαουλ ἀγγέλους λέγων ἀπόδος μοι τὴν γυναῖκά μου τὴν Μελχολ ἣν ἔλαβον ἐν ἑκατὸν ἀκροβυστίαις ἀλλοφύλων
15 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Μεμφιβοσθε καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν παρὰ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς παρὰ Φαλτιηλ υἱοῦ Σελλης
16 καὶ ἐπορεύετο ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς με{T'} αὐτῆς κλαίων ὀπίσω αὐτῆς ἕως Βαρακιμ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Αβεννηρ πορεύου ἀνάστρεφε καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν
17 καὶ εἶπεν Αβεννηρ πρὸς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ισραηλ λέγων ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἐζητεῖτε τὸν Δαυιδ βασιλεύειν ἐ{F'} ὑμῶν
18 καὶ νῦν ποιήσατε ὅτι κύριος ἐλάλησεν περὶ Δαυιδ λέγων ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ δούλου μου Δαυιδ σώσω τὸν Ισραηλ ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν
19 καὶ ἐλάλησεν Αβεννηρ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν Βενιαμιν καὶ ἐπορεύθη Αβεννηρ τοῦ λαλῆσαι εἰς τὰ ὦτα τοῦ Δαυιδ εἰς Χεβρων πάντα ὅσα ἤρεσεν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Ισραηλ καὶ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς παντὸς οἴκου Βενιαμιν
20 καὶ ἦλθεν Αβεννηρ πρὸς Δαυιδ εἰς Χεβρων καὶ με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἴκοσι ἄνδρες καὶ ἐποίησεν Δαυιδ τῷ Αβεννηρ καὶ τοῖς ἀνδράσιν τοῖς με{T'} αὐτοῦ πότον
21 καὶ εἶπεν Αβεννηρ πρὸς Δαυιδ ἀναστήσομαι δὴ καὶ πορεύσομαι καὶ συναθροίσω πρὸς κύριόν μου τὸν βασιλέα πάντα Ισραηλ καὶ διαθήσομαι μετὰ σοῦ διαθήκην καὶ βασιλεύσεις ἐπὶ πᾶσιν οἷς ἐπιθυμεῖ ἡ ψυχή σου καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Δαυιδ τὸν Αβεννηρ καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν εἰρήνῃ

22 καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ παῖδες Δαυιδ καὶ Ιωαβ παρεγίνοντο ἐκ τῆς ἐξοδίας καὶ σκῦλα πολλὰ ἔφερον με{T'} αὐτῶν καὶ Αβεννηρ οὐκ ἦν μετὰ Δαυιδ εἰς Χεβρων ὅτι ἀπεστάλκει αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπεληλύθει ἐν εἰρήνῃ
23 καὶ Ιωαβ καὶ πᾶσα ἡ στρατιὰ αὐτοῦ ἤχθησαν καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ιωαβ λέγοντες ἥκει Αβεννηρ υἱὸς Νηρ πρὸς Δαυιδ καὶ ἀπέσταλκεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐν εἰρήνῃ
24 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ιωαβ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ εἶπεν τί τοῦτο ἐποίησας ἰδοὺ ἦλθεν Αβεννηρ πρὸς σέ καὶ ἵνα τί ἐξαπέσταλκας αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπελήλυθεν ἐν εἰρήνῃ
25 ἦ οὐκ οἶδας τὴν κακίαν Αβεννηρ υἱοῦ Νηρ ὅτι ἀπατῆσαί σε παρεγένετο καὶ γνῶναι τὴν ἔξοδόν σου καὶ τὴν εἴσοδόν σου καὶ γνῶναι ἅπαντα ὅσα σὺ ποιεῖς
26 καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν Ιωαβ ἀπὸ τοῦ Δαυιδ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους ὀπίσω Αβεννηρ καὶ ἐπιστρέφουσιν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ φρέατος τοῦ Σεϊραμ καὶ Δαυιδ οὐκ ᾔδει
27 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Αβεννηρ εἰς Χεβρων καὶ ἐξέκλινεν αὐτὸν Ιωαβ ἐκ πλαγίων τῆς πύλης λαλῆσαι πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐνεδρεύων καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ ἐπὶ τὴν ψόαν καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐν τῷ αἵματι Ασαηλ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ Ιωαβ
28 καὶ ἤκουσεν Δαυιδ μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ εἶπεν ἀθῷός εἰμι ἐγὼ καὶ ἡ βασιλεία μου ἀπὸ κυρίου ἕως αἰῶνος ἀπὸ τῶν αἱμάτων Αβεννηρ υἱοῦ Νηρ
29 καταντησάτωσαν ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν Ιωαβ καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ μὴ ἐκλίποι ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου Ιωαβ γονορρυὴς καὶ λεπρὸς καὶ κρατῶν σκυτάλης καὶ πίπτων ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ ἐλασσούμενος ἄρτοις

30 Ιωαβ δὲ καὶ Αβεσσα ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ διεπαρετηροῦντο τὸν Αβεννηρ ἀν{Q'} ὧν ἐθανάτωσεν τὸν Ασαηλ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτῶν ἐν Γαβαων ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ
31 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Ιωαβ καὶ πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαὸν τὸν με{T'} αὐτοῦ διαρρήξατε τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν καὶ περιζώσασθε σάκκους καὶ κόπτεσθε ἔμπροσθεν Αβεννηρ καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυιδ ἐπορεύετο ὀπίσω τῆς κλίνης
32 καὶ θάπτουσιν τὸν Αβεννηρ εἰς Χεβρων καὶ ἦρεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ἐπὶ τοῦ τάφου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔκλαυσεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ Αβεννηρ
33 καὶ ἐθρήνησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ Αβεννηρ καὶ εἶπεν εἰ κατὰ τὸν θάνατον Ναβαλ ἀποθανεῖται Αβεννηρ
34 αἱ χεῖρές σου οὐκ ἐδέθησαν οἱ πόδες σου οὐκ ἐν πέδαις οὐ προσήγαγεν ὡς Ναβαλ ἐνώπιον υἱῶν ἀδικίας ἔπεσας καὶ συνήχθη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τοῦ κλαῦσαι αὐτόν
35 καὶ ἦλθεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς περιδειπνῆσαι τὸν Δαυιδ ἄρτοις ἔτι οὔσης ἡμέρας καὶ ὤμοσεν Δαυιδ λέγων τάδε ποιήσαι μοι ὁ θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη ὅτι ἐὰν μὴ δύῃ ὁ ἥλιος οὐ μὴ γεύσωμαι ἄρτου ἢ ἀπὸ παντός τινος
36 καὶ ἔγνω πᾶς ὁ λαός καὶ ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐνώπιον τοῦ λαοῦ
37 καὶ ἔγνω πᾶς ὁ λαὸς καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ὅτι οὐκ ἐγένετο παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως θανατῶσαι τὸν Αβεννηρ υἱὸν Νηρ
38 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ἡγούμενος μέγας πέπτωκεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ ἐν τῷ Ισραηλ
39 καὶ ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι σήμερον συγγενὴς καὶ καθεσταμένος ὑπὸ βασιλέως οἱ δὲ ἄνδρες οὗτοι υἱοὶ Σαρουιας σκληρότεροί μού εἰσιν ἀνταποδῷ κύριος τῷ ποιοῦντι πονηρὰ κατὰ τὴν κακίαν αὐτοῦ
