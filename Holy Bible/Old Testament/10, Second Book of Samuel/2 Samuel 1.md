# Second Book of Samuel 1 (RSVCE)

### David Mourns for Saul and Jonathan
1 After the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalʹekites, David remained two days in Ziklag;
2 and on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul’s camp, with his clothes rent and earth upon his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and did obeisance.
3 David said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”
4 And David said to him, “How did it go? Tell me.” And he answered, “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.”
5 Then David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
6 And the young man who told him said, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboʹa; and there was Saul leaning upon his spear; and lo, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him.
7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’
8 And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalʹekite.’
9 And he said to me, ‘Stand beside me and slay me; for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.’
10 So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen; and I took the crown which was on his head and the armlet which was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”
11 Then David took hold of his clothes, and rent them; and so did all the men who were with him;
12 and they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of theLordand for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
13 And David said to the young man who told him, “Where do you come from?” And he answered, “I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalʹekite.”
14 David said to him, “How is it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy theLord’s anointed?”
15 Then David called one of the young men and said, “Go, fall upon him.” And he smote him so that he died.
16 And David said to him, “Your blood be upon your head; for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have slain theLord’s anointed.’ ”
17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son,
18 and he said it should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar. He said:
19 “Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!
20 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashʹkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
21 “Ye mountains of Gilboʹa, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor upsurging of the deep!c For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
22 “From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
23 “Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! In life and in death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
24 “Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you daintily in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
25 “How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! “Jonathan lies slain upon thy high places.
26 I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant have you been to me; your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
27 “How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!”


# Liber Secundus Samuelis, Quem Nos Secundum Regum Dicimus 1 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem, postquam mortuus est Saul, ut David reverteretur a cæde Amalec, et maneret in Siceleg duos dies.
2 In die autem tertia apparuit homo veniens de castris Saul veste conscissa, et pulvere conspersus caput: et ut venit ad David, cecidit super faciem suam, et adoravit.
3 Dixitque ad eum David: Unde venis? Qui ait ad eum: De castris Israël fugi.
4 Et dixit ad eum David: Quod est verbum quod factum est? indica mihi. Qui ait: Fugit populus ex prælio, et multi corruentes e populo mortui sunt: sed et Saul et Jonathas filius ejus interierunt.
5 Dixitque David ad adolescentem qui nuntiabat ei: Unde scis quia mortuus est Saul, et Jonathas filius ejus?
6 Et ait adolescens qui nuntiabat ei: Casu veni in montem Gelboë, et Saul incumbebat super hastam suam: porro currus et equites appropinquabant ei,
7 et conversus post tergum suum, vidensque me, vocavit. Cui cum respondissem: Adsum:
8 dixit mihi: Quisnam es tu? Et aio ad eum: Amalecites ego sum.
9 Et locutus est mihi: Sta super me, et interfice me: quoniam tenent me angustiæ, et adhuc tota anima mea in me est.
10 Stansque super eum, occidi illum: sciebam enim quod vivere non poterat post ruinam: et tuli diadema quod erat in capite ejus, et armillam de brachio illius, et attuli ad te dominum meum huc.
11 Apprehendens autem David, vestimenta sua scidit, omnesque viri qui erant cum eo,
12 et planxerunt, et fleverunt, et jejunaverunt usque ad vesperam super Saul, et super Jonathan filium ejus, et super populum Domini, et super domum Israël, eo quod corruissent gladio.

13 Dixitque David ad juvenem qui nuntiaverat ei: Unde es tu? Qui respondit: Filius hominis advenæ Amalecitæ ego sum.
14 Et ait ad eum David: Quare non timuisti mittere manum tuam ut occideres christum Domini?
15 Vocansque David unum de pueris suis, ait: Accedens irrue in eum. Qui percussit illum, et mortuus est.
16 Et ait ad eum David: Sanguis tuus super caput tuum: os enim tuum locutum est adversum te, dicens: Ego interfeci christum Domini.

17 Planxit autem David planctum hujuscemodi super Saul, et super Jonathan filium ejus
18 (et præcepit ut docerent filios Juda arcum, sicut scriptum est in libro justorum), et ait:Considera, Israël, pro his qui mortui sunt,super excelsa tua vulnerati.
19 Inclyti Israël super montes tuos interfecti sunt:quomodo ceciderunt fortes?
20 Nolite annuntiare in Geth,neque annuntietis in compitis Ascalonis:ne forte lætentur filiæ Philisthiim;ne exultent filiæ incircumcisorum.
21 Montes Gelboë, nec ros, nec pluvia veniant super vos,neque sint agri primitiarum:quia ibi abjectus est clypeus fortium:clypeus Saul, quasi non esset unctus oleo.
22 A sanguine interfectorum, ab adipe fortium,sagitta Jonathæ numquam rediit retrorsum,et gladius Saul non est reversus inanis.
23 Saul et Jonathas amabiles, et decori in vita sua,in morte quoque non sunt divisi:aquilis velociores, leonibus fortiores.
24 Filiæ Israël, super Saul flete,qui vestiebat vos coccino in deliciis,qui præbebat ornamenta aurea cultui vestro.
25 Quomodo ceciderunt fortes in prælio?Jonathas in excelsis tuis occisus est?
26 Doleo super te, frater mi Jonatha,decore nimis, et amabilis super amorem mulierum.Sicut mater unicum amat filium suum,ita ego te diligebam.
27 Quomodo ceciderunt robusti,et perierunt arma bellica?

1 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν Σαουλ καὶ Δαυιδ ἀνέστρεψεν τύπτων τὸν Αμαληκ καὶ ἐκάθισεν Δαυιδ ἐν Σεκελακ ἡμέρας δύο
2 καὶ ἐγενήθη τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ ἦλθεν ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ Σαουλ καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ διερρωγότα καὶ γῆ ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ εἰσελθεῖν αὐτὸν πρὸς Δαυιδ καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ
3 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δαυιδ πόθεν σὺ παραγίνῃ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς Ισραηλ ἐγὼ διασέσῳσμαι
4 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δαυιδ τίς ὁ λόγος οὗτος ἀπάγγειλόν μοι καὶ εἶπεν ὅτι ἔφυγεν ὁ λαὸς ἐκ τοῦ πολέμου καὶ πεπτώκασι πολλοὶ ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ἀπέθανον καὶ ἀπέθανεν καὶ Σαουλ καὶ Ιωναθαν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπέθανεν
5 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ τῷ παιδαρίῳ τῷ ἀπαγγέλλοντι αὐτῷ πῶς οἶδας ὅτι τέθνηκεν Σαουλ καὶ Ιωναθαν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ εἶπεν τὸ παιδάριον τὸ ἀπαγγέλλον αὐτῷ περιπτώματι περιέπεσον ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ Γελβουε καὶ ἰδοὺ Σαουλ ἐπεστήρικτο ἐπὶ τὸ δόρυ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἰδοὺ τὰ ἅρματα καὶ οἱ ἱππάρχαι συνῆψαν αὐτῷ
7 καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ τὰ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶδέν με καὶ ἐκάλεσέν με καὶ εἶπα ἰδοὺ ἐγώ
8 καὶ εἶπέν μοι τίς εἶ σύ καὶ εἶπα Αμαληκίτης ἐγώ εἰμι
9 καὶ εἶπεν πρός με στῆθι δὴ ἐπάνω μου καὶ θανάτωσόν με ὅτι κατέσχεν με σκότος δεινόν ὅτι πᾶσα ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν ἐμοί
10 καὶ ἐπέστην ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν καὶ ἐθανάτωσα αὐτόν ὅτι ᾔδειν ὅτι οὐ ζήσεται μετὰ τὸ πεσεῖν αὐτόν καὶ ἔλαβον τὸ βασίλειον τὸ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν χλιδῶνα τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ βραχίονος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐνήνοχα αὐτὰ τῷ κυρίῳ μου ὧδε
11 καὶ ἐκράτησεν Δαυιδ τῶν ἱματίων αὐτοῦ καὶ διέρρηξεν αὐτά καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ διέρρηξαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν
12 καὶ ἐκόψαντο καὶ ἔκλαυσαν καὶ ἐνήστευσαν ἕως δείλης ἐπὶ Σαουλ καὶ ἐπὶ Ιωναθαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν Ιουδα καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ισραηλ ὅτι ἐπλήγησαν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ

13 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ τῷ παιδαρίῳ τῷ ἀπαγγέλλοντι αὐτῷ πόθεν εἶ σύ καὶ εἶπεν υἱὸς ἀνδρὸς παροίκου Αμαληκίτου ἐγώ εἰμι
14 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δαυιδ πῶς οὐκ ἐφοβήθης ἐπενεγκεῖν χεῖρά σου διαφθεῖραι τὸν χριστὸν κυρίου
15 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Δαυιδ ἓν τῶν παιδαρίων αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν προσελθὼν ἀπάντησον αὐτῷ καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτόν καὶ ἀπέθανεν
16 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ πρὸς αὐτόν τὸ αἷμά σου ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλήν σου ὅτι τὸ στόμα σου ἀπεκρίθη κατὰ σοῦ λέγων ὅτι ἐγὼ ἐθανάτωσα τὸν χριστὸν κυρίου

17 καὶ ἐθρήνησεν Δαυιδ τὸν θρῆνον τοῦτον ἐπὶ Σαουλ καὶ ἐπὶ Ιωναθαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ
18 καὶ εἶπεν τοῦ διδάξαι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ιουδα ἰδοὺ γέγραπται ἐπὶ βιβλίου τοῦ εὐθοῦς
19 στήλωσον Ισραηλ ὑπὲρ τῶν τεθνηκότων ἐπὶ τὰ ὕψη σου τραυματιῶν πῶς ἔπεσαν δυνατοί
20 μὴ ἀναγγείλητε ἐν Γεθ καὶ μὴ εὐαγγελίσησθε ἐν ταῖς ἐξόδοις Ἀσκαλῶνος μήποτε εὐφρανθῶσιν θυγατέρες ἀλλοφύλων μήποτε ἀγαλλιάσωνται θυγατέρες τῶν ἀπεριτμήτων
21 ὄρη τὰ ἐν Γελβουε μὴ καταβῇ δρόσος καὶ μὴ ὑετὸς ἐ{F'} ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀγροὶ ἀπαρχῶν ὅτι ἐκεῖ προσωχθίσθη θυρεὸς δυνατῶν θυρεὸς Σαουλ οὐκ ἐχρίσθη ἐν ἐλαίῳ
22 ἀ{F'} αἵματος τραυματιῶν ἀπὸ στέατος δυνατῶν τόξον Ιωναθαν οὐκ ἀπεστράφη κενὸν εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω καὶ ῥομφαία Σαουλ οὐκ ἀνέκαμψεν κενή
23 Σαουλ καὶ Ιωναθαν οἱ ἠγαπημένοι καὶ ὡραῖοι οὐ διακεχωρισμένοι εὐπρεπεῖς ἐν τῇ ζωῇ αὐτῶν καὶ ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ αὐτῶν οὐ διεχωρίσθησαν ὑπὲρ ἀετοὺς κοῦφοι καὶ ὑπὲρ λέοντας ἐκραταιώθησαν
24 θυγατέρες Ισραηλ ἐπὶ Σαουλ κλαύσατε τὸν ἐνδιδύσκοντα ὑμᾶς κόκκινα μετὰ κόσμου ὑμῶν τὸν ἀναφέροντα κόσμον χρυσοῦν ἐπὶ τὰ ἐνδύματα ὑμῶν
25 πῶς ἔπεσαν δυνατοὶ ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ πολέμου Ιωναθαν ἐπὶ τὰ ὕψη σου τραυματίας
26 ἀλγῶ ἐπὶ σοί ἄδελφέ μου Ιωναθαν ὡραιώθης μοι σφόδρα ἐθαυμαστώθη ἡ ἀγάπησίς σου ἐμοὶ ὑπὲρ ἀγάπησιν γυναικῶν
27 πῶς ἔπεσαν δυνατοὶ καὶ ἀπώλοντο σκεύη πολεμικά
