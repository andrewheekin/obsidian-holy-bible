# Second Book of Samuel 4 (RSVCE)

### Ishbaal Assassinated
1 When Ish-boʹsheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner had died at Hebron, his courage failed, and all Israel was dismayed.
2 Now Saul’s son had two men who were captains of raiding bands; the name of the one was Baʹanah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon a man of Benjamin from Be-erʹoth (for Be-erʹoth also is reckoned to Benjamin;
3 the Be-erʹothites fled to Gittaʹim, and have been sojourners there to this day).
4 Jonathan, the son of Saul, had a son who was crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreʹel; and his nurse took him up, and fled; and, as she fled in her haste, he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibʹosheth.
5 Now the sons of Rimmon the Be-erʹothite, Rechab and Baʹanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-boʹsheth, as he was taking his noonday rest.
6 And behold, the doorkeeper of the house had been cleaning wheat, but she grew drowsy and slept; so Rechab and Baʹanah his brother slipped in.
7 When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him. They took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night,
8 and brought the head of Ish-boʹsheth to David at Hebron. And they said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-boʹsheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; theLordhas avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring.”
9 But David answered Rechab and Baʹanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Be-erʹothite, “As theLordlives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity,
10 when one told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and slew him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.
11 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous man in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood at your hand, and destroy you from the earth?”
12 And David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and feet, and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-boʹsheth, and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.


# Liber Secundus Samuelis, Quem Nos Secundum Regum Dicimus 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Audivit autem Isboseth filius Saul quod cecidisset Abner in Hebron: et dissolutæ sunt manus ejus, omnisque Israël perturbatus est.
2 Duo autem viri principes latronum erant filio Saul, nomen uni Baana, et nomen alteri Rechab, filii Remmon Berothitæ de filiis Benjamin: siquidem et Beroth reputata est in Benjamin.
3 Et fugerunt Berothitæ in Gethaim, fueruntque ibi advenæ usque ad tempus illud.
4 Erat autem Jonathæ filio Saul filius debilis pedibus: quinquennis enim fuit, quando venit nuntius de Saul et Jonatha ex Jezrahel. Tollens itaque eum nutrix sua, fugit: cumque festinaret ut fugeret, cecidit, et claudus effectus est: habuitque vocabulum Miphiboseth.

5 Venientes igitur filii Remmon Berothitæ, Rechab et Baana, ingressi sunt fervente die domum Isboseth: qui dormiebat super stratum suum meridie. Et ostiaria domus purgans triticum, obdormivit.
6 Ingressi sunt autem domum latenter assumentes spicas tritici, et percusserunt eum in inguine Rechab, et Baana frater ejus, et fugerunt.
7 Cum autem ingressi fuissent domum, ille dormiebat super lectum suum in conclavi, et percutientes interfecerunt eum: sublatoque capite ejus, abierunt per viam deserti tota nocte,
8 et attulerunt caput Isboseth ad David in Hebron: dixeruntque ad regem: Ecce caput Isboseth filii Saul inimici tui, qui quærebat animam tuam: et dedit Dominus domino meo regi ultionem hodie de Saul, et de semine ejus.

9 Respondens autem David Rechab, et Baana fratri ejus, filiis Remmon Berothitæ, dixit ad eos: Vivit Dominus, qui eruit animam meam de omni angustia,
10 quoniam eum qui annuntiaverat mihi, et dixerat: Mortuus est Saul: qui putabat se prospera nuntiare, tenui, et occidi eum in Siceleg, cui oportebat mercedem dare pro nuntio.
11 Quanto magis nunc cum homines impii interfecerunt virum innoxium in domo sua, super lectum suum, non quæram sanguinem ejus de manu vestra, et auferam vos de terra?
12 Præcepit itaque David pueris suis, et interfecerunt eos: præcidentesque manus et pedes eorum, suspenderunt eos super piscinam in Hebron: caput autem Isboseth tulerunt, et sepelierunt in sepulchro Abner in Hebron.

1 καὶ ἤκουσεν Μεμφιβοσθε υἱὸς Σαουλ ὅτι τέθνηκεν Αβεννηρ ἐν Χεβρων καὶ ἐξελύθησαν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες Ισραηλ παρείθησαν
2 καὶ δύο ἄνδρες ἡγούμενοι συστρεμμάτων τῷ Μεμφιβοσθε υἱῷ Σαουλ ὄνομα τῷ ἑνὶ Βαανα καὶ ὄνομα τῷ δευτέρῳ Ρηχαβ υἱοὶ Ρεμμων τοῦ Βηρωθαίου ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Βενιαμιν ὅτι Βηρωθ ἐλογίζετο τοῖς υἱοῖς Βενιαμιν
3 καὶ ἀπέδρασαν οἱ Βηρωθαῖοι εἰς Γεθθαιμ καὶ ἦσαν ἐκεῖ παροικοῦντες ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
4 καὶ τῷ Ιωναθαν υἱῷ Σαουλ υἱὸς πεπληγὼς τοὺς πόδας υἱὸς ἐτῶν πέντε οὗτος ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν τὴν ἀγγελίαν Σαουλ καὶ Ιωναθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐξ Ιεζραελ καὶ ἦρεν αὐτὸν ἡ τιθηνὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφυγεν καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ σπεύδειν αὐτὴν καὶ ἀναχωρεῖν καὶ ἔπεσεν καὶ ἐχωλάνθη καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Μεμφιβοσθε

5 καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν υἱοὶ Ρεμμων τοῦ Βηρωθαίου Ρεκχα καὶ Βαανα καὶ εἰσῆλθον ἐν τῷ καύματι τῆς ἡμέρας εἰς οἶκον Μεμφιβοσθε καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκάθευδεν ἐν τῇ κοίτῃ τῆς μεσημβρίας
6 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ θυρωρὸς τοῦ οἴκου ἐκάθαιρεν πυροὺς καὶ ἐνύσταξεν καὶ ἐκάθευδεν καὶ Ρεκχα καὶ Βαανα οἱ ἀδελφοὶ διέλαθον
7 καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸν οἶκον καὶ Μεμφιβοσθε ἐκάθευδεν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ κοιτῶνι αὐτοῦ καὶ τύπτουσιν αὐτὸν καὶ θανατοῦσιν καὶ ἀφαιροῦσιν τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπῆλθον ὁδὸν τὴν κατὰ δυσμὰς ὅλην τὴν νύκτα
8 καὶ ἤνεγκαν τὴν κεφαλὴν Μεμφιβοσθε τῷ Δαυιδ εἰς Χεβρων καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἰδοὺ ἡ κεφαλὴ Μεμφιβοσθε υἱοῦ Σαουλ τοῦ ἐχθροῦ σου ὃς ἐζήτει τὴν ψυχήν σου καὶ ἔδωκεν κύριος τῷ κυρίῳ βασιλεῖ ἐκδίκησιν τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτοῦ ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη ἐκ Σαουλ τοῦ ἐχθροῦ σου καὶ ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ

9 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Δαυιδ τῷ Ρεκχα καὶ τῷ Βαανα ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ υἱοῖς Ρεμμων τοῦ Βηρωθαίου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ζῇ κύριος ὃς ἐλυτρώσατο τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐκ πάσης θλίψεως
10 ὅτι ὁ ἀπαγγείλας μοι ὅτι τέθνηκεν Σαουλ καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν ὡς εὐαγγελιζόμενος ἐνώπιόν μου καὶ κατέσχον αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπέκτεινα ἐν Σεκελακ ᾧ ἔδει με δοῦναι εὐαγγέλια
11 καὶ νῦν ἄνδρες πονηροὶ ἀπεκτάγκασιν ἄνδρα δίκαιον ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ καὶ νῦν ἐκζητήσω τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐκ χειρὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσω ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῆς γῆς
12 καὶ ἐνετείλατο Δαυιδ τοῖς παιδαρίοις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀποκτέννουσιν αὐτοὺς καὶ κολοβοῦσιν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν καὶ ἐκρέμασαν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τῆς κρήνης ἐν Χεβρων καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Μεμφιβοσθε ἔθαψαν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ Αβεννηρ υἱοῦ Νηρ
