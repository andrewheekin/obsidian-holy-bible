# Second Book of Samuel 12 (RSVCE)

### Nathan Condemns David
1 And theLordsent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor.
2 The rich man had very many flocks and herds;
3 but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children; it used to eat of his morsel, and drink from his cup, and lie in his bosom, and it was like a daughter to him.
4 Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him, but he took the poor man’s lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”
5 Then David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, “As theLordlives, the man who has done this deserves to die;
6 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.”
7 Nathan said to David, “You are the man. Thus says theLord, the God of Israel, ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul;
8 and I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if this were too little, I would add to you as much more.
9 Why have you despised the word of theLord, to do what is evil in his sight? You have smitten Uriʹah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites.
10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriʹah the Hittite to be your wife.’
11 Thus says theLord, ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
12 For you did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’ ”
13 David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against theLord.” And Nathan said to David, “TheLordalso has put away your sin; you shall not die.
14 Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned theLord, the child that is born to you shall die.”
### Bathsheba’s Child Dies
15 Then Nathan went to his house. And theLordstruck the child that Uriʹah’s wife bore to David, and it became sick.
16 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in and lay all night upon the ground.
17 And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground; but he would not, nor did he eat food with them.
18 On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us; how then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.”
19 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” They said, “He is dead.”
20 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of theLord, and worshiped; he then went to his own house; and when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate.
21 Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.”
22 He said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether theLordwill be gracious to me, that the child may live?’
23 But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.”
### Solomon Is Born
24 Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheʹba, and went in to her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And theLordloved him,
25 and sent a message by Nathan the prophet; so he called his name Jedidiʹah, because of theLord.
### The Ammonites Crushed
26 Now Joʹab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and took the royal city.
27 And Joʹab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters.
28 Now, then, gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called by my name.”
29 So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and fought against it and took it.
30 And he took the crown of their king from his head; the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
31 And he brought forth the people who were in it, and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes, and made them toil at the brickkilns; and thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.


# Liber Secundus Samuelis, Quem Nos Secundum Regum Dicimus 12 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Misit ergo Dominus Nathan ad David: qui cum venisset ad eum, dixit ei: Duo viri erant in civitate una, unus dives, et alter pauper.
2 Dives habebat oves et boves plurimos valde.
3 Pauper autem nihil habebat omnino, præter ovem unam parvulam quam emerat et nutrierat, et quæ creverat apud eum cum filiis ejus simul, de pane illius comedens, et de calice ejus bibens, et in sinu illius dormiens: eratque illi sicut filia.
4 Cum autem peregrinus quidam venisset ad divitem, parcens ille sumere de ovibus et de bobus suis, ut exhiberet convivium peregrino illi qui venerat ad se, tulit ovem viri pauperis, et præparavit cibos homini qui venerat ad se.
5 Iratus autem indignatione David adversus hominem illum nimis, dixit ad Nathan: Vivit Dominus, quoniam filius mortis est vir qui fecit hoc.
6 Ovem reddet in quadruplum, eo quod fecerit verbum istud, et non pepercerit.
7 Dixit autem Nathan ad David: Tu es ille vir. Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Ego unxi te in regem super Israël, et ego erui te de manu Saul,
8 et dedi tibi domum domini tui, et uxores domini tui in sinu tuo, dedique tibi domum Israël et Juda: et si parva sunt ista, adjiciam tibi multo majora.
9 Quare ergo contempsisti verbum Domini, ut faceres malum in conspectu meo? Uriam Hethæum percussisti gladio, et uxorem illius accepisti in uxorem tibi, et interfecisti eum gladio filiorum Ammon.
10 Quam ob rem non recedet gladius de domo tua usque in sempiternum, eo quod despexeris me, et tuleris uxorem Uriæ Hethæi ut esset uxor tua.
11 Itaque hæc dicit Dominus: Ecce ego suscitabo super te malum de domo tua, et tollam uxores tuas in oculis tuis, et dabo proximo tuo: et dormiet cum uxoribus tuis in oculis solis hujus.
12 Tu enim fecisti abscondite: ego autem faciam verbum istud in conspectu omnis Israël, et in conspectu solis.

13 Et dixit David ad Nathan: Peccavi Domino. Dixitque Nathan ad David: Dominus quoque transtulit peccatum tuum: non morieris.
14 Verumtamen quoniam blasphemare fecisti inimicos Domini, propter verbum hoc, filius qui natus est tibi, morte morietur.
15 Et reversus est Nathan in domum suam. Percussit quoque Dominus parvulum quem pepererat uxor Uriæ David, et desperatus est.
16 Deprecatusque est David Dominum pro parvulo: et jejunavit David jejunio, et ingressus seorsum, jacuit super terram.
17 Venerunt autem seniores domus ejus, cogentes eum ut surgeret de terra: qui noluit, nec comedit cum eis cibum.
18 Accidit autem die septima ut moreretur infans: timueruntque servi David nuntiare ei quod mortuus esset parvulus: dixerunt enim: Ecce cum parvulus adhuc viveret, loquebamur ad eum, et non audiebat vocem nostram: quanto magis si dixerimus: Mortuus est puer, se affliget?
19 Cum ergo David vidisset servos suos mussitantes, intellexit quod mortuus esset infantulus: dixitque ad servos suos: Num mortuus est puer? Qui responderunt ei: Mortuus est.
20 Surrexit ergo David de terra, et lotus unctusque est: cumque mutasset vestem, ingressus est domum Domini: et adoravit, et venit in domum suam, petivitque ut ponerent ei panem, et comedit.
21 Dixerunt autem ei servi sui: Quis est sermo quem fecisti? propter infantem, cum adhuc viveret, jejunasti et flebas: mortuo autem puero, surrexisti, et comedisti panem.
22 Qui ait: Propter infantem, dum adhuc viveret, jejunavi et flevi: dicebam enim: Quis scit si forte donet eum mihi Dominus, et vivat infans?
23 Nunc autem quia mortuus est, quare jejunem? numquid potero revocare eum amplius? ego vadam magis ad eum: ille vero non revertetur ad me.
24 Et consolatus est David Bethsabee uxorem suam, ingressusque ad eam dormivit cum ea: quæ genuit filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Salomon: et Dominus dilexit eum.
25 Misitque in manu Nathan prophetæ, et vocavit nomen ejus, Amabilis Domino, eo quod diligeret eum Dominus.

26 Igitur pugnabat Joab contra Rabbath filiorum Ammon, et expugnabat urbem regiam.
27 Misitque Joab nuntios ad David, dicens: Dimicavi adversum Rabbath, et capienda est Urbs aquarum.
28 Nunc igitur congrega reliquam partem populi, et obside civitatem, et cape eam: ne cum a me vastata fuerit urbs, nomini meo ascribatur victoria.
29 Congregavit itaque David omnem populum, et profectus est adversum Rabbath: cumque dimicasset, cepit eam.
30 Et tulit diadema regis eorum de capite ejus, pondo auri talentum, habens gemmas pretiosissimas: et impositum est super caput David. Sed et prædam civitatis asportavit multam valde:
31 populum quoque ejus adducens serravit, et circumegit super eos ferrata carpenta: divisitque cultris, et traduxit in typo laterum: sic fecit universis civitatibus filiorum Ammon. Et reversus est David et omnis exercitus in Jerusalem.


# Βασιλειῶν Βʹ 12 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν κύριος τὸν Ναθαν τὸν προφήτην πρὸς Δαυιδ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ δύο ἦσαν ἄνδρες ἐν πόλει μιᾷ εἷς πλούσιος καὶ εἷς πένης
2 καὶ τῷ πλουσίῳ ἦν ποίμνια καὶ βουκόλια πολλὰ σφόδρα
3 καὶ τῷ πένητι οὐδὲν ἀλ{L'} ἢ ἀμνὰς μία μικρά ἣν ἐκτήσατο καὶ περιεποιήσατο καὶ ἐξέθρεψεν αὐτήν καὶ ἡδρύνθη με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ μετὰ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό ἐκ τοῦ ἄρτου αὐτοῦ ἤσθιεν καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ποτηρίου αὐτοῦ ἔπινεν καὶ ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ αὐτοῦ ἐκάθευδεν καὶ ἦν αὐτῷ ὡς θυγάτηρ
4 καὶ ἦλθεν πάροδος τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ πλουσίῳ καὶ ἐφείσατο λαβεῖν ἐκ τῶν ποιμνίων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκ τῶν βουκολίων αὐτοῦ τοῦ ποιῆσαι τῷ ξένῳ ὁδοιπόρῳ ἐλθόντι πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ ἔλαβεν τὴν ἀμνάδα τοῦ πένητος καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὴν τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ ἐλθόντι πρὸς αὐτόν
5 καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ Δαυιδ σφόδρα τῷ ἀνδρί καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ πρὸς Ναθαν ζῇ κύριος ὅτι υἱὸς θανάτου ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ποιήσας τοῦτο
6 καὶ τὴν ἀμνάδα ἀποτείσει ἑπταπλασίονα ἀν{Q'} ὧν ὅτι ἐποίησεν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο καὶ περὶ οὗ οὐκ ἐφείσατο
7 καὶ εἶπεν Ναθαν πρὸς Δαυιδ σὺ εἶ ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ποιήσας τοῦτο τάδε λέγει κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἐγώ εἰμι ἔχρισά σε εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ἐγώ εἰμι ἐρρυσάμην σε ἐκ χειρὸς Σαουλ
8 καὶ ἔδωκά σοι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ κυρίου σου καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας τοῦ κυρίου σου ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ σου καὶ ἔδωκά σοι τὸν οἶκον Ισραηλ καὶ Ιουδα καὶ εἰ μικρόν ἐστιν προσθήσω σοι κατὰ ταῦτα
9 τί ὅτι ἐφαύλισας τὸν λόγον κυρίου τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ τὸν Ουριαν τὸν Χετταῖον ἐπάταξας ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ ἔλαβες σεαυτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα καὶ αὐτὸν ἀπέκτεινας ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ υἱῶν Αμμων
10 καὶ νῦν οὐκ ἀποστήσεται ῥομφαία ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου σου ἕως αἰῶνος ἀν{Q'} ὧν ὅτι ἐξουδένωσάς με καὶ ἔλαβες τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ Ουριου τοῦ Χετταίου τοῦ εἶναί σοι εἰς γυναῖκα
11 τάδε λέγει κύριος ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξεγείρω ἐπὶ σὲ κακὰ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου σου καὶ λήμψομαι τὰς γυναῖκάς σου κα{T'} ὀφθαλμούς σου καὶ δώσω τῷ πλησίον σου καὶ κοιμηθήσεται μετὰ τῶν γυναικῶν σου ἐναντίον τοῦ ἡλίου τούτου
12 ὅτι σὺ ἐποίησας κρυβῇ κἀγὼ ποιήσω τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ἐναντίον παντὸς Ισραηλ καὶ ἀπέναντι τούτου τοῦ ἡλίου

13 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ τῷ Ναθαν ἡμάρτηκα τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ εἶπεν Ναθαν πρὸς Δαυιδ καὶ κύριος παρεβίβασεν τὸ ἁμάρτημά σου οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνῃς
14 πλὴν ὅτι παροξύνων παρώξυνας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς κυρίου ἐν τῷ ῥήματι τούτῳ καί γε ὁ υἱός σου ὁ τεχθείς σοι θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖται
15 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Ναθαν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθραυσεν κύριος τὸ παιδίον ὃ ἔτεκεν ἡ γυνὴ Ουριου τῷ Δαυιδ καὶ ἠρρώστησεν
16 καὶ ἐζήτησεν Δαυιδ τὸν θεὸν περὶ τοῦ παιδαρίου καὶ ἐνήστευσεν Δαυιδ νηστείαν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ηὐλίσθη ἐν σάκκῳ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
17 καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἐγεῖραι αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν καὶ οὐ συνέφαγεν αὐτοῖς ἄρτον
18 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ καὶ ἀπέθανε τὸ παιδάριον καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ δοῦλοι Δαυιδ ἀναγγεῖλαι αὐτῷ ὅτι τέθνηκεν τὸ παιδάριον ὅτι εἶπαν ἰδοὺ ἐν τῷ ἔτι τὸ παιδάριον ζῆν ἐλαλήσαμεν πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσεν τῆς φωνῆς ἡμῶν καὶ πῶς εἴπωμεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὅτι τέθνηκεν τὸ παιδάριον καὶ ποιήσει κακά
19 καὶ συνῆκεν Δαυιδ ὅτι οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ψιθυρίζουσιν καὶ ἐνόησεν Δαυιδ ὅτι τέθνηκεν τὸ παιδάριον καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ εἰ τέθνηκεν τὸ παιδάριον καὶ εἶπαν τέθνηκεν
20 καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυιδ ἐκ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐλούσατο καὶ ἠλείψατο καὶ ἤλλαξεν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ ᾔτησεν ἄρτον φαγεῖν καὶ παρέθηκαν αὐτῷ ἄρτον καὶ ἔφαγεν
21 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτόν τί τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ὃ ἐποίησας ἕνεκα τοῦ παιδαρίου ἔτι ζῶντος ἐνήστευες καὶ ἔκλαιες καὶ ἠγρύπνεις καὶ ἡνίκα ἀπέθανεν τὸ παιδάριον ἀνέστης καὶ ἔφαγες ἄρτον καὶ πέπωκας
22 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ ἐν τῷ τὸ παιδάριον ἔτι ζῆν ἐνήστευσα καὶ ἔκλαυσα ὅτι εἶπα τίς οἶδεν εἰ ἐλεήσει με κύριος καὶ ζήσεται τὸ παιδάριον
23 καὶ νῦν τέθνηκεν ἵνα τί τοῦτο ἐγὼ νηστεύω μὴ δυνήσομαι ἐπιστρέψαι αὐτὸ ἔτι ἐγὼ πορεύσομαι πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ αὐτὸς οὐκ ἀναστρέψει πρός με
24 καὶ παρεκάλεσεν Δαυιδ Βηρσαβεε τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτὴν καὶ ἐκοιμήθη με{T'} αὐτῆς καὶ συνέλαβεν καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱόν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Σαλωμων καὶ κύριος ἠγάπησεν αὐτόν
25 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἐν χειρὶ Ναθαν τοῦ προφήτου καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ιδεδι ἕνεκεν κυρίου

26 καὶ ἐπολέμησεν Ιωαβ ἐν Ραββαθ υἱῶν Αμμων καὶ κατέλαβεν τὴν πόλιν τῆς βασιλείας
27 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιωαβ ἀγγέλους πρὸς Δαυιδ καὶ εἶπεν ἐπολέμησα ἐν Ραββαθ καὶ κατελαβόμην τὴν πόλιν τῶν ὑδάτων
28 καὶ νῦν συνάγαγε τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ παρέμβαλε ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν καὶ προκαταλαβοῦ αὐτήν ἵνα μὴ προκαταλάβωμαι ἐγὼ τὴν πόλιν καὶ κληθῇ τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐ{P'} αὐτήν
29 καὶ συνήγαγεν Δαυιδ πάντα τὸν λαὸν καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Ραββαθ καὶ ἐπολέμησεν ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ κατελάβετο αὐτήν
30 καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸν στέφανον Μελχολ τοῦ βασιλέως αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ σταθμὸς αὐτοῦ τάλαντον χρυσίου καὶ λίθου τιμίου καὶ ἦν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς Δαυιδ καὶ σκῦλα τῆς πόλεως ἐξήνεγκεν πολλὰ σφόδρα
31 καὶ τὸν λαὸν τὸν ὄντα ἐν αὐτῇ ἐξήγαγεν καὶ ἔθηκεν ἐν τῷ πρίονι καὶ ἐν τοῖς τριβόλοις τοῖς σιδηροῖς καὶ διήγαγεν αὐτοὺς διὰ τοῦ πλινθείου καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησεν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσιν υἱῶν Αμμων καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Δαυιδ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς εἰς Ιερουσαλημ
