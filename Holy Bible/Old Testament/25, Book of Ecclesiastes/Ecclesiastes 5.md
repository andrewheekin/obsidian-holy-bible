# Book of Ecclesiastes 5 (RSVCE)

### Reverence, Humility, and Contentment
1 Guard your steps when you go to the house of God; to draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know that they are doing evil.
2 Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven, and you upon earth; therefore let your words be few.
3 For a dream comes with much business, and a fool’s voice with many words.
4 When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow.
5 It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
6 Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake; why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?
7 For when dreams increase, empty words grow many: but do you fear God.
8 If you see in a province the poor oppressed and justice and right violently taken away, do not be amazed at the matter; for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.
9 But in all, a king is an advantage to a land with cultivated fields.
10 He who loves money will not be satisfied with money; nor he who loves wealth, with gain: this also is vanity.
11 When goods increase, they increase who eat them; and what gain has their owner but to see them with his eyes?
12 Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much; but the surfeit of the rich will not let him sleep.
13 There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,
14 and those riches were lost in a bad venture; and he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand.
15 As he came from his mother’s womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil, which he may carry away in his hand.
16 This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go; and what gain has he that he toiled for the wind,
17 and spent all his days in darkness and grief, in much vexation and sickness and resentment?
18 Behold, what I have seen to be good and to be fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life which God has given him, for this is his lot.
19 Every man also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and find enjoyment in his toil—this is the gift of God.
20 For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.


# Liber Ecclesiastes 5 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Ne temere quid loquaris,neque cor tuum sit velox ad proferendum sermonem coram Deo.Deus enim in cælo, et tu super terram;idcirco sint pauci sermones tui.
2 Multas curas sequuntur somnia,et in multis sermonibus invenietur stultitia.
3 Si quid vovisti Deo,ne moreris reddere:displicet enim ei infidelis et stulta promissio,sed quodcumque voveris redde:
4 multoque melius est non vovere,quam post votum promissa non reddere.
5 Ne dederis os tuum ut peccare facias carnem tuam,neque dicas coram angelo:Non est providentia:ne forte iratus Deus contra sermones tuosdissipet cuncta opera manuum tuarum.
6 Ubi multa sunt somnia,plurimæ sunt vanitates, et sermones innumeri;tu vero Deum time.

7 Si videris calumnias egenorum, et violenta judicia,et subverti justitiam in provincia,non mireris super hoc negotio:quia excelso excelsior est alius,et super hos quoque eminentiores sunt alii;
8 et insuper universæ terræ rex imperat servienti.
9 Avarus non implebitur pecunia,et qui amat divitias fructum non capiet ex eis;et hoc ergo vanitas.
10 Ubi multæ sunt opes,multi et qui comedunt eas.Et quid prodest possessori,nisi quod cernit divitias oculis suis?
11 Dulcis est somnus operanti,sive parum sive multum comedat;saturitas autem divitis non sinit eum dormire.

12 Est et alia infirmitas pessima quam vidi sub sole:divitiæ conservatæ in malum domini sui.
13 Pereunt enim in afflictione pessima:generavit filium qui in summa egestate erit.
14 Sicut egressus est nudus de utero matris suæ, sic revertetur,et nihil auferet secum de labore suo.
15 Miserabilis prorsus infirmitas:quomodo venit, sic revertetur.Quid ergo prodest ei quod laboravit in ventum?
16 cunctis diebus vitæ suæ comedit in tenebris,et in curis multis, et in ærumna atque tristitia.
17 Hoc itaque visum est mihi bonum,ut comedat quis et bibat,et fruatur lætitia ex labore suoquo laboravit ipse sub sole,numero dierum vitæ suæquos dedit ei Deus;et hæc est pars illius.
18 Et omni homini cui dedit Deus divitias atque substantiam,potestatemque ei tribuit ut comedat ex eis,et fruatur parte sua, et lætetur de labore suo:hoc est donum Dei.
19 Non enim satis recordabitur dierum vitæ suæ,eo quod Deus occupet deliciis cor ejus.


# Ἐκκλησιαστής 5 (Septuagint)

1 μὴ σπεῦδε ἐπὶ στόματί σου καὶ καρδία σου μὴ ταχυνάτω τοῦ ἐξενέγκαι λόγον πρὸ προσώπου τοῦ θεοῦ ὅτι ὁ θεὸς ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ καὶ σὺ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἐπὶ τούτῳ ἔστωσαν οἱ λόγοι σου ὀλίγοι
2 ὅτι παραγίνεται ἐνύπνιον ἐν πλήθει περισπασμοῦ καὶ φωνὴ ἄφρονος ἐν πλήθει λόγων
3 καθὼς ἂν εὔξῃ εὐχὴν τῷ θεῷ μὴ χρονίσῃς τοῦ ἀποδοῦναι αὐτήν ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν θέλημα ἐν ἄφροσιν σὺν ὅσα ἐὰν εὔξῃ ἀπόδος
4 ἀγαθὸν τὸ μὴ εὔξασθαί σε ἢ τὸ εὔξασθαί σε καὶ μὴ ἀποδοῦναι
5 μὴ δῷς τὸ στόμα σου τοῦ ἐξαμαρτῆσαι τὴν σάρκα σου καὶ μὴ εἴπῃς πρὸ προσώπου τοῦ θεοῦ ὅτι ἄγνοιά ἐστιν ἵνα μὴ ὀργισθῇ ὁ θεὸς ἐπὶ φωνῇ σου καὶ διαφθείρῃ τὰ ποιήματα χειρῶν σου
6 ὅτι ἐν πλήθει ἐνυπνίων καὶ ματαιότητες καὶ λόγοι πολλοί ὅτι σὺν τὸν θεὸν φοβοῦ

7 ἐὰν συκοφαντίαν πένητος καὶ ἁρπαγὴν κρίματος καὶ δικαιοσύνης ἴδῃς ἐν χώρᾳ μὴ θαυμάσῃς ἐπὶ τῷ πράγματι ὅτι ὑψηλὸς ἐπάνω ὑψηλοῦ φυλάξαι καὶ ὑψηλοὶ ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
8 καὶ περισσεία γῆς ἐν παντί ἐστι βασιλεὺς τοῦ ἀγροῦ εἰργασμένου
9 ἀγαπῶν ἀργύριον οὐ πλησθήσεται ἀργυρίου καὶ τίς ἠγάπησεν ἐν πλήθει αὐτῶν γένημα καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης
10 ἐν πλήθει τῆς ἀγαθωσύνης ἐπληθύνθησαν ἔσθοντες αὐτήν καὶ τί ἀνδρεία τῷ πα{R'} αὐτῆς ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ τοῦ ὁρᾶν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ
11 γλυκὺς ὕπνος τοῦ δούλου εἰ ὀλίγον καὶ εἰ πολὺ φάγεται καὶ τῷ ἐμπλησθέντι τοῦ πλουτῆσαι οὐκ ἔστιν ἀφίων αὐτὸν τοῦ ὑπνῶσαι

12 ἔστιν ἀρρωστία ἣν εἶδον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον πλοῦτον φυλασσόμενον τῷ πα{R'} αὐτοῦ εἰς κακίαν αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ ἀπολεῖται ὁ πλοῦτος ἐκεῖνος ἐν περισπασμῷ πονηρῷ καὶ ἐγέννησεν υἱόν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ οὐδέν
14 καθὼς ἐξῆλθεν ἀπὸ γαστρὸς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ γυμνός ἐπιστρέψει τοῦ πορευθῆναι ὡς ἥκει καὶ οὐδὲν οὐ λήμψεται ἐν μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ ἵνα πορευθῇ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ
15 καί γε τοῦτο πονηρὰ ἀρρωστία ὥσπερ γὰρ παρεγένετο οὕτως καὶ ἀπελεύσεται καὶ τίς περισσεία αὐτῷ ᾗ μοχθεῖ εἰς ἄνεμον
16 καί γε πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι αὐτοῦ ἐν σκότει καὶ πένθει καὶ θυμῷ πολλῷ καὶ ἀρρωστίᾳ καὶ χόλῳ
17 ἰδοὺ ὃ εἶδον ἐγὼ ἀγαθόν ὅ ἐστιν καλόν τοῦ φαγεῖν καὶ τοῦ πιεῖν καὶ τοῦ ἰδεῖν ἀγαθωσύνην ἐν παντὶ μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ ᾧ ἐὰν μοχθῇ ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον ἀριθμὸν ἡμερῶν ζωῆς αὐτοῦ ὧν ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ θεός ὅτι αὐτὸ μερὶς αὐτοῦ
18 καί γε πᾶς ὁ ἄνθρωπος ᾧ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ θεὸς πλοῦτον καὶ ὑπάρχοντα καὶ ἐξουσίασεν αὐτὸν τοῦ φαγεῖν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ λαβεῖν τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ εὐφρανθῆναι ἐν μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ τοῦτο δόμα θεοῦ ἐστιν
19 ὅτι οὐ πολλὰ μνησθήσεται τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ ὅτι ὁ θεὸς περισπᾷ αὐτὸν ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ καρδίας αὐτοῦ
