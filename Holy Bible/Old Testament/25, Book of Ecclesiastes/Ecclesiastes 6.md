# Book of Ecclesiastes 6 (RSVCE)

### The Frustration of Desires
1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy upon men:
2 a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them; this is vanity; it is a sore affliction.
3 If a man begets a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but he does not enjoy life’s good things, and also has no burial, I say that an untimely birth is better off than he.
4 For it comes into vanity and goes into darkness, and in darkness its name is covered;
5 moreover it has not seen the sun or known anything; yet it finds rest rather than he.
6 Even though he should live a thousand years twice told, yet enjoy no good—do not all go to the one place?
7 All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.
8 For what advantage has the wise man over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?
9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire; this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
10 Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than he.
11 The more words, the more vanity, and what is man the better?
12 For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his vain life, which he passes like a shadow? For who can tell man what will be after him under the sun?


# Liber Ecclesiastes 6 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Est et aliud malum quod vidi sub sole,et quidem frequens apud homines:
2 vir cui dedit Deus divitias,et substantiam, et honorem,et nihil deest animæ suæ ex omnibus quæ desiderat;nec tribuit ei potestatem Deus ut comedat ex eo,sed homo extraneus vorabit illud:hoc vanitas et miseria magna est.
3 Si genuerit quispiam centum liberos,et vixerit multos annos,et plures dies ætatis habuerit,et anima illius non utatur bonis substantiæ suæ,sepulturaque careat:de hoc ergo pronuntio quod melior illo sit abortivus.
4 Frustra enim venit,et pergit ad tenebras,et oblivione delebitur nomen ejus.
5 Non vidit solem,neque cognovit distantiam boni et mali.
6 Etiam si duobus millibus annis vixerit,et non fuerit perfruitus bonis,nonne ad unum locum properant omnia?

7 Omnis labor hominis in ore ejus;sed anima ejus non implebitur.
8 Quid habet amplius sapiens a stulto?et quid pauper, nisi ut pergat illuc ubi est vita?

9 Melius est videre quod cupias,quam desiderare quod nescias.Sed et hoc vanitas est, et præsumptio spiritus.

10 Qui futurus est, jam vocatum est nomen ejus;et scitur quod homo sit,et non possit contra fortiorem se in judicio contendere.

11 Verba sunt plurima,multamque in disputando habentia vanitatem.


# Ἐκκλησιαστής 6 (Septuagint)

1 ἔστιν πονηρία ἣν εἶδον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον καὶ πολλή ἐστιν ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον
2 ἀνήρ ᾧ δώσει αὐτῷ ὁ θεὸς πλοῦτον καὶ ὑπάρχοντα καὶ δόξαν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὑστερῶν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν ἐπιθυμήσει καὶ οὐκ ἐξουσιάσει αὐτῷ ὁ θεὸς τοῦ φαγεῖν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἀνὴρ ξένος φάγεται αὐτόν τοῦτο ματαιότης καὶ ἀρρωστία πονηρά ἐστιν
3 ἐὰν γεννήσῃ ἀνὴρ ἑκατὸν καὶ ἔτη πολλὰ ζήσεται καὶ πλῆθος ὅ τι ἔσονται ἡμέραι ἐτῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐμπλησθήσεται ἀπὸ τῆς ἀγαθωσύνης καί γε ταφὴ οὐκ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ εἶπα ἀγαθὸν ὑπὲρ αὐτὸν τὸ ἔκτρωμα
4 ὅτι ἐν ματαιότητι ἦλθεν καὶ ἐν σκότει πορεύεται καὶ ἐν σκότει ὄνομα αὐτοῦ καλυφθήσεται
5 καί γε ἥλιον οὐκ εἶδεν καὶ οὐκ ἔγνω ἀνάπαυσις τούτῳ ὑπὲρ τοῦτον
6 καὶ εἰ ἔζησεν χιλίων ἐτῶν καθόδους καὶ ἀγαθωσύνην οὐκ εἶδεν μὴ οὐκ εἰς τόπον ἕνα τὰ πάντα πορεύεται

7 πᾶς μόχθος τοῦ ἀνθρώπου εἰς στόμα αὐτοῦ καί γε ἡ ψυχὴ οὐ πληρωθήσεται
8 ὅτι τίς περισσεία τῷ σοφῷ ὑπὲρ τὸν ἄφρονα διότι ὁ πένης οἶδεν πορευθῆναι κατέναντι τῆς ζωῆς

9 ἀγαθὸν ὅραμα ὀφθαλμῶν ὑπὲρ πορευόμενον ψυχῇ καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης καὶ προαίρεσις πνεύματος

10 εἴ τι ἐγένετο ἤδη κέκληται ὄνομα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγνώσθη ὅ ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος καὶ οὐ δυνήσεται τοῦ κριθῆναι μετὰ τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ ὑπὲρ αὐτόν

11 ὅτι εἰσὶν λόγοι πολλοὶ πληθύνοντες ματαιότητα τί περισσὸν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ
