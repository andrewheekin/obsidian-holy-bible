# Book of Ecclesiastes 4 (RSVCE)

1 Again I saw all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them.
2 And I thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive;
3 but better than both is he who has not yet been, and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
4 Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man’s envy of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
5 The fool folds his hands, and eats his own flesh.
6 Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.
7 Again, I saw vanity under the sun:
8 a person who has no one, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” This also is vanity and an unhappy business.
### The Value of a Friend
9 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.
10 For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up.
11 Again, if two lie together, they are warm; but how can one be warm alone?
12 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him. A threefold cord is not quickly broken.
13 Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who will no longer take advice,
14 even though he had gone from prison to the throne or in his own kingdom had been born poor.
15 I saw all the living who move about under the sun, as well as that youth, who was to stand in his place;
16 there was no end of all the people; he was over all of them. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.


# Liber Ecclesiastes 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Verti me ad alia, et vidi calumniasquæ sub sole geruntur,et lacrimas innocentium,et neminem consolatorem,nec posse resistere eorum violentiæ,cunctorum auxilio destitutos,
2 et laudavi magis mortuos quam viventes;
3 et feliciorem utroque judicaviqui necdum natus est,nec vidit mala quæ sub sole fiunt.

4 Rursum contemplatus sum omnes labores hominum,et industrias animadverti patere invidiæ proximi;et in hoc ergo vanitas et cura superflua est.
5 Stultus complicat manus suas,et comedit carnes suas, dicens:
6 Melior est pugillus cum requie,quam plena utraque manus cum labore et afflictione animi.

7 Considerans, reperi et aliam vanitatem sub sole.
8 Unus est, et secundum non habet,non filium, non fratrem,et tamen laborare non cessat,nec satiantur oculi ejus divitiis;nec recogitat, dicens:Cui laboro, et fraudo animam meam bonis?In hoc quoque vanitas est et afflictio pessima.

9 Melius est ergo duos esse simul quam unum;habent enim emolumentum societatis suæ.
10 Si unus ceciderit, ab altero fulcietur.Væ soli, quia cum ceciderit, non habet sublevantem se.
11 Et si dormierint duo, fovebuntur mutuo;unus quomodo calefiet?
12 Et si quispiam prævaluerit contra unum,duo resistunt ei;funiculus triplex difficile rumpitur.

13 Melior est puer pauper et sapiens,rege sene et stulto,qui nescit prævidere in posterum.
14 Quod de carcere catenisque interdum quis egrediatur ad regnum;et alius, natus in regno, inopia consumatur.
15 Vidi cunctos viventes qui ambulant sub solecum adolescente secundo, qui consurget pro eo.
16 Infinitus numerus est populiomnium qui fuerunt ante eum,et qui postea futuri sunt non lætabuntur in eo;sed et hoc vanitas et afflictio spiritus.

17 Custodi pedem tuum ingrediens domum Dei,et appropinqua ut audias.Multo enim melior est obedientia quam stultorum victimæ,qui nesciunt quid faciunt mali.


# Ἐκκλησιαστής 4 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐπέστρεψα ἐγὼ καὶ εἶδον σὺν πάσας τὰς συκοφαντίας τὰς γινομένας ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον καὶ ἰδοὺ δάκρυον τῶν συκοφαντουμένων καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς παρακαλῶν καὶ ἀπὸ χειρὸς συκοφαντούντων αὐτοὺς ἰσχύς καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς παρακαλῶν
2 καὶ ἐπῄνεσα ἐγὼ σὺν τοὺς τεθνηκότας τοὺς ἤδη ἀποθανόντας ὑπὲρ τοὺς ζῶντας ὅσοι αὐτοὶ ζῶσιν ἕως τοῦ νῦν
3 καὶ ἀγαθὸς ὑπὲρ τοὺς δύο τούτους ὅστις οὔπω ἐγένετο ὃς οὐκ εἶδεν σὺν τὸ ποίημα τὸ πονηρὸν τὸ πεποιημένον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον

4 καὶ εἶδον ἐγὼ σὺν πάντα τὸν μόχθον καὶ σὺν πᾶσαν ἀνδρείαν τοῦ ποιήματος ὅτι αὐτὸ ζῆλος ἀνδρὸς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑταίρου αὐτοῦ καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης καὶ προαίρεσις πνεύματος
5 ὁ ἄφρων περιέλαβεν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφαγεν τὰς σάρκας αὐτοῦ
6 ἀγαθὸν πλήρωμα δρακὸς ἀναπαύσεως ὑπὲρ πλήρωμα δύο δρακῶν μόχθου καὶ προαιρέσεως πνεύματος

7 καὶ ἐπέστρεψα ἐγὼ καὶ εἶδον ματαιότητα ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον
8 ἔστιν εἷς καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν δεύτερος καί γε υἱὸς καὶ ἀδελφὸς οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν περασμὸς τῷ παντὶ μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ καί γε ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐμπίπλαται πλούτου καὶ τίνι ἐγὼ μοχθῶ καὶ στερίσκω τὴν ψυχήν μου ἀπὸ ἀγαθωσύνης καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης καὶ περισπασμὸς πονηρός ἐστιν

9 ἀγαθοὶ οἱ δύο ὑπὲρ τὸν ἕνα οἷς ἔστιν αὐτοῖς μισθὸς ἀγαθὸς ἐν μόχθῳ αὐτῶν
10 ὅτι ἐὰν πέσωσιν ὁ εἷς ἐγερεῖ τὸν μέτοχον αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐαὶ αὐτῷ τῷ ἑνί ὅταν πέσῃ καὶ μὴ ᾖ δεύτερος τοῦ ἐγεῖραι αὐτόν
11 καί γε ἐὰν κοιμηθῶσιν δύο καὶ θέρμη αὐτοῖς καὶ ὁ εἷς πῶς θερμανθῇ
12 καὶ ἐὰν ἐπικραταιωθῇ ὁ εἷς οἱ δύο στήσονται κατέναντι αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ σπαρτίον τὸ ἔντριτον οὐ ταχέως ἀπορραγήσεται

13 ἀγαθὸς παῖς πένης καὶ σοφὸς ὑπὲρ βασιλέα πρεσβύτερον καὶ ἄφρονα ὃς οὐκ ἔγνω τοῦ προσέχειν ἔτι
14 ὅτι ἐξ οἴκου τῶν δεσμίων ἐξελεύσεται τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι ὅτι καί γε ἐν βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ ἐγεννήθη πένης
15 εἶδον σὺν πάντας τοὺς ζῶντας τοὺς περιπατοῦντας ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον μετὰ τοῦ νεανίσκου τοῦ δευτέρου ὃς στήσεται ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
16 οὐκ ἔστιν περασμὸς τῷ παντὶ λαῷ τοῖς πᾶσιν ὅσοι ἐγένοντο ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν καί γε οἱ ἔσχατοι οὐκ εὐφρανθήσονται ἐν αὐτῷ ὅτι καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης καὶ προαίρεσις πνεύματος

17 φύλαξον πόδα σου ἐν ᾧ ἐὰν πορεύῃ εἰς οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐγγὺς τοῦ ἀκούειν ὑπὲρ δόμα τῶν ἀφρόνων θυσία σου ὅτι οὔκ εἰσιν εἰδότες τοῦ ποιῆσαι κακόν
