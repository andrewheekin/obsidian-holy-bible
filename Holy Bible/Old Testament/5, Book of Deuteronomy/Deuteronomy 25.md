# Book of Deuteronomy 25 (RSVCE)

1 “If there is a dispute between men, and they come into court, and the judges decide between them, acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty,
2 then if the guilty man deserves to be beaten, the judge shall cause him to lie down and be beaten in his presence with a number of stripes in proportion to his offense.
3 Forty stripes may be given him, but not more; lest, if one should go on to beat him with more stripes than these, your brother be degraded in your sight.
4 “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.
### Levirate Marriage
5 “If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the dead shall not be married outside the family to a stranger; her husband’s brother shall go in to her, and take her as his wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her.
6 And the first son whom she bears shall succeed to the name of his brother who is dead, that his name may not be blotted out of Israel.
7 And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife, then his brother’s wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say, ‘My husband’s brother refuses to perpetuate his brother’s name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband’s brother to me.’
8 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him: and if he persists, saying, ‘I do not wish to take her,’
9 then his brother’s wife shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, and pull his sandal off his foot, and spit in his face; and she shall answer and say, ‘So shall it be done to the man who does not build up his brother’s house.’
10 And the name of his house shall be called in Israel, The house of him that had his sandal pulled off.
### Various Commands
11 “When men fight with one another, and the wife of the one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of him who is beating him, and puts out her hand and seizes him by the private parts,
12 then you shall cut off her hand; your eye shall have no pity.
13 “You shall not have in your bag two kinds of weights, a large and a small.
14 You shall not have in your house two kinds of measures, a large and a small.
15 A full and just weight you shall have, a full and just measure you shall have; that your days may be prolonged in the land which theLordyour God gives you.
16 For all who do such things, all who act dishonestly, are an abomination to theLordyour God.
17 “Remember what Amʹalek did to you on the way as you came out of Egypt,
18 how he attacked you on the way, when you were faint and weary, and cut off at your rear all who lagged behind you; and he did not fear God.
19 Therefore when theLordyour God has given you rest from all your enemies round about, in the land which theLordyour God gives you for an inheritance to possess, you shall blot out the remembrance of Amʹalek from under heaven; you shall not forget.


# Liber Deuteronomii 25 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Si fuerit causa inter aliquos, et interpellaverint judices: quem justum esse perspexerint, illi justitiæ palmam dabunt: quem impium, condemnabunt impietatis.
2 Sin autem eum, qui peccavit, dignum viderint plagis: prosternent, et coram se facient verberari. Pro mensura peccati erit et plagarum modus:
3 ita dumtaxat, ut quadragenarium numerum non excedant: ne fœde laceratus ante oculos tuos abeat frater tuus.

4 Non ligabis os bovis terentis in area fruges tuas.

5 Quando habitaverint fratres simul, et unus ex eis absque liberis mortuus fuerit, uxor defuncti non nubet alteri: sed accipiet eam frater ejus, et suscitabit semen fratris sui:
6 et primogenitum ex ea filium nomine illius appellabit, ut non deleatur nomen ejus ex Israël.
7 Sin autem noluerit accipere uxorem fratris sui, quæ ei lege debetur, perget mulier ad portam civitatis, et interpellabit majores natu, dicetque: Non vult frater viri mei suscitare nomen fratris sui in Israël, nec me in conjugem sumere.
8 Statimque accersiri eum facient, et interrogabunt. Si responderit: Nolo eam uxorem accipere:
9 accedet mulier ad eum coram senioribus, et tollet calceamentum de pede ejus, spuetque in faciem illius, et dicet: Sic fiet homini, qui non ædificat domum fratris sui.
10 Et vocabitur nomen illius in Israël, Domus discalceati.

11 Si habuerint inter se jurgium viri duo, et unus contra alterum rixari cœperit, volensque uxor alterius eruere virum suum de manu fortioris, miseritque manum, et apprehenderit verenda ejus:
12 abscides manum illius, nec flecteris super eam ulla misericordia.

13 Non habebis in sacculo diversa pondera, majus et minus:
14 nec erit in domo tua modius major, et minor.
15 Pondus habebis justum et verum, et modius æqualis et verus erit tibi: ut multo vivas tempore super terram, quam Dominus Deus tuus dederit tibi.
16 Abominatur enim Dominus tuus eum qui facit hæc, et aversatur omnem injustitiam.

17 Memento quæ fecerit tibi Amalec in via quando egrediebaris ex Ægypto:
18 quomodo occurrerit tibi, et extremos agminis tui, qui lassi residebant, ceciderit, quando tu eras fame et labore confectus: et non timuerit Deum.
19 Cum ergo Dominus Deus tuus dederit tibi requiem, et subjecerit cunctas per circuitum nationes in terra, quam tibi pollicitus est: delebis nomen ejus sub cælo. Cave ne obliviscaris.


# Δευτερονόμιον 25 (Septuagint)

1 ἐὰν δὲ γένηται ἀντιλογία ἀνὰ μέσον ἀνθρώπων καὶ προσέλθωσιν εἰς κρίσιν καὶ κρίνωσιν καὶ δικαιώσωσιν τὸν δίκαιον καὶ καταγνῶσιν τοῦ ἀσεβοῦς
2 καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν ἄξιος ᾖ πληγῶν ὁ ἀσεβῶν καὶ καθιεῖς αὐτὸν ἔναντι τῶν κριτῶν καὶ μαστιγώσουσιν αὐτὸν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν κατὰ τὴν ἀσέβειαν αὐτοῦ ἀριθμῷ
3 τεσσαράκοντα μαστιγώσουσιν αὐτόν οὐ προσθήσουσιν ἐὰν δὲ προσθῶσιν μαστιγῶσαι αὐτὸν ὑπὲρ ταύτας τὰς πληγὰς πλείους ἀσχημονήσει ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἐναντίον σου

4 οὐ φιμώσεις βοῦν ἀλοῶντα

5 ἐὰν δὲ κατοικῶσιν ἀδελφοὶ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ καὶ ἀποθάνῃ εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν σπέρμα δὲ μὴ ᾖ αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔσται ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ τεθνηκότος ἔξω ἀνδρὶ μὴ ἐγγίζοντι ὁ ἀδελφὸς τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς εἰσελεύσεται πρὸς αὐτὴν καὶ λήμψεται αὐτὴν ἑαυτῷ γυναῖκα καὶ συνοικήσει αὐτῇ
6 καὶ ἔσται τὸ παιδίον ὃ ἐὰν τέκῃ κατασταθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ ὀνόματος τοῦ τετελευτηκότος καὶ οὐκ ἐξαλειφθήσεται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐξ Ισραηλ
7 ἐὰν δὲ μὴ βούληται ὁ ἄνθρωπος λαβεῖν τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀναβήσεται ἡ γυνὴ ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην ἐπὶ τὴν γερουσίαν καὶ ἐρεῖ οὐ θέλει ὁ ἀδελφὸς τοῦ ἀνδρός μου ἀναστῆσαι τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐν Ισραηλ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ὁ ἀδελφὸς τοῦ ἀνδρός μου
8 καὶ καλέσουσιν αὐτὸν ἡ γερουσία τῆς πόλεως αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐροῦσιν αὐτῷ καὶ στὰς εἴπῃ οὐ βούλομαι λαβεῖν αὐτήν
9 καὶ προσελθοῦσα ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ ἔναντι τῆς γερουσίας καὶ ὑπολύσει τὸ ὑπόδημα αὐτοῦ τὸ ἓν ἀπὸ τοῦ ποδὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐμπτύσεται εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀποκριθεῖσα ἐρεῖ οὕτως ποιήσουσιν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ὃς οὐκ οἰκοδομήσει τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ
10 καὶ κληθήσεται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐν Ισραηλ οἶκος τοῦ ὑπολυθέντος τὸ ὑπόδημα

11 ἐὰν δὲ μάχωνται ἄνθρωποι ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό ἄνθρωπος μετὰ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ προσέλθῃ γυνὴ ἑνὸς αὐτῶν ἐξελέσθαι τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ τύπτοντος αὐτὸν καὶ ἐκτείνασα τὴν χεῖρα ἐπιλάβηται τῶν διδύμων αὐτοῦ
12 ἀποκόψεις τὴν χεῖρα αὐτῆς οὐ φείσεται ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου ἐ{P'} αὐτῇ

13 οὐκ ἔσται ἐν τῷ μαρσίππῳ σου στάθμιον καὶ στάθμιον μέγα ἢ μικρόν
14 οὐκ ἔσται ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ σου μέτρον καὶ μέτρον μέγα ἢ μικρόν
15 στάθμιον ἀληθινὸν καὶ δίκαιον ἔσται σοι καὶ μέτρον ἀληθινὸν καὶ δίκαιον ἔσται σοι ἵνα πολυήμερος γένῃ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἧς κύριος ὁ θεός σου δίδωσίν σοι ἐν κλήρῳ
16 ὅτι βδέλυγμα κυρίῳ τῷ θεῷ σου πᾶς ποιῶν ταῦτα πᾶς ποιῶν ἄδικον

17 μνήσθητι ὅσα ἐποίησέν σοι Αμαληκ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἐκπορευομένου σου ἐξ Αἰγύπτου
18 πῶς ἀντέστη σοι ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ἔκοψέν σου τὴν οὐραγίαν τοὺς κοπιῶντας ὀπίσω σου σὺ δὲ ἐπείνας καὶ ἐκοπίας καὶ οὐκ ἐφοβήθη τὸν θεόν
19 καὶ ἔσται ἡνίκα ἐὰν καταπαύσῃ σε κύριος ὁ θεός σου ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν σου τῶν κύκλῳ σου ἐν τῇ γῇ ᾗ κύριος ὁ θεός σου δίδωσίν σοι ἐν κλήρῳ κατακληρονομῆσαι ἐξαλείψεις τὸ ὄνομα Αμαληκ ἐκ τῆς ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐπιλάθῃ
