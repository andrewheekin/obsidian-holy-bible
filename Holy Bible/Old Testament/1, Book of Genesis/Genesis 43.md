# Book of Genesis 43 (RSVCE)

### The Brothers Come Again, Bringing Benjamin
1 Now the famine was severe in the land.
2 And when they had eaten the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little food.”
3 But Judah said to him, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’
4 If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food;
5 but if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ ”
6 Israel said, “Why did you treat me so ill as to tell the man that you had another brother?”
7 They replied, “The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ What we told him was in answer to these questions; could we in any way know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”
8 And Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.
9 I will be surety for him; of my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame for ever;
10 for if we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice.”
11 Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man a present, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
12 Take double the money with you; carry back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight.
13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man;
14 may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, that he may send back your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”
15 So the men took the present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin; and they arose and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.”
17 The man did as Joseph bade him, and brought the men to Joseph’s house.
18 And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph’s house, and they said, “It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, to make slaves of us and seize our asses.”
19 So they went up to the steward of Joseph’s house, and spoke with him at the door of the house,
20 and said, “Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food;
21 and when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was every man’s money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it again with us,
22 and we have brought other money down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.”
23 He replied, “Rest assured, do not be afraid; your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your sacks for you; I received your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
24 And when the man had brought the men into Joseph’s house, and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their asses provender,
25 they made ready the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
26 When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which they had with them, and bowed down to him to the ground.
27 And he inquired about their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?”
28 They said, “Your servant our father is well, he is still alive.” And they bowed their heads and made obeisance.
29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!”
30 Then Joseph made haste, for his heart yearned for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there.
31 Then he washed his face and came out; and controlling himself he said, “Let food be served.”
32 They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
33 And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at one another in amazement.
34 Portions were taken to them from Joseph’s table, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.


# Liber Genesis 43 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Interim fames omnem terram vehementer premebat.
2 Consumptisque cibis quos ex Ægypto detulerant, dixit Jacob ad filios suos: Revertimini, et emite nobis pauxillum escarum.
3 Respondit Judas: Denuntiavit nobis vir ille sub attestatione jurisjurandi, dicens: Non videbitis faciem meam, nisi fratrem vestrum minimum adduxeritis vobiscum.
4 Si ergo vis eum mittere nobiscum, pergemus pariter, et ememus tibi necessaria:
5 sin autem non vis, non ibimus: vir enim, ut sæpe diximus, denuntiavit nobis, dicens: Non videbitis faciem meam absque fratre vestro minimo.
6 Dixit eis Israël: In meam hoc fecistis miseriam, ut indicaretis ei et alium habere vos fratrem.
7 At illi responderunt: Interrogavit nos homo per ordinem nostram progeniem: si pater viveret: si haberemus fratrem: et nos respondimus ei consequenter juxta id quod fuerat sciscitatus: numquid scire poteramus quod dicturus esset: Adducite fratrem vestrum vobiscum?
8 Judas quoque dixit patri suo: Mitte puerum mecum, ut proficiscamur, et possimus vivere: ne moriamur nos et parvuli nostri.
9 Ego suscipio puerum: de manu mea require illum: nisi reduxero, et reddidero eum tibi, ero peccati reus in te omni tempore.
10 Si non intercessisset dilatio, jam vice alter venissemus.

11 Igitur Israël pater eorum dixit ad eos: Si sic necesse est, facite quod vultis: sumite de optimis terræ fructibus in vasis vestris, et deferte viro munera, modicum resinæ, et mellis, et storacis, stactes, et terebinthi, et amygdalarum.
12 Pecuniam quoque duplicem ferte vobiscum: et illam, quam invenistis in sacculis, reportate, ne forte errore factum sit:
13 sed et fratrem vestrum tollite, et ite ad virum.
14 Deus autem meus omnipotens faciat vobis eum placabilem: et remittat vobiscum fratrem vestrum quem tenet, et hunc Benjamin: ego autem quasi orbatus absque liberis ero.
15 Tulerunt ergo viri munera, et pecuniam duplicem, et Benjamin: descenderuntque in Ægyptum, et steterunt coram Joseph.

16 Quos cum ille vidisset et Benjamin simul, præcepit dispensatori domus suæ, dicens: Introduc viros domum, et occide victimas, et instrue convivium: quoniam mecum sunt comesturi meridie.
17 Fecit ille quod sibi fuerat imperatum, et introduxit viros domum.
18 Ibique exterriti, dixerunt mutuo: Propter pecuniam, quam retulimus prius in saccis nostris, introducti sumus: ut devolvat in nos calumniam, et violenter subjiciat servituti et nos, et asinos nostros.
19 Quam ob rem in ipsis foribus accedentes ad dispensatorem domus,
20 locuti sunt: Oramus, domine, ut audias nos. Jam ante descendimus ut emeremus escas:
21 quibus emptis, cum venissemus ad diversorium, aperuimus saccos nostros, et invenimus pecuniam in ore saccorum: quam nunc eodem pondere reportavimus.
22 Sed et aliud attulimus argentum, ut emamus quæ nobis necessaria sunt: non est in nostra conscientia quis posuerit eam in marsupiis nostris.
23 At ille respondit: Pax vobiscum, nolite timere: Deus vester, et Deus patris vestri, dedit vobis thesauros in saccis vestris: nam pecuniam, quam dedistis mihi, probatam ego habeo. Eduxitque ad eos Simeon.
24 Et introductis domum, attulit aquam, et laverunt pedes suos, deditque pabulum asinis eorum.

25 Illi vero parabant munera, donec ingrederetur Joseph meridie: audierant enim quod ibi comesturi essent panem.
26 Igitur ingressus est Joseph domum suam, obtuleruntque ei munera, tenentes in manibus suis: et adoraverunt proni in terram.
27 At ille, clementer resalutatis eis, interrogavit eos, dicens: Salvusne est pater vester senex, de quo dixeratis mihi? adhuc vivit?
28 Qui responderunt: Sospes est servus tuus pater noster, adhuc vivit. Et incurvati, adoraverunt eum.
29 Attollens autem Joseph oculos, vidit Benjamin fratrem suum uterinum, et ait: Iste est frater vester parvulus, de quo dixeratis mihi? Et rursum: Deus, inquit, misereatur tui, fili mi.
30 Festinavitque, quia commota fuerant viscera ejus super fratre suo, et erumpebant lacrimæ: et introiens cubiculum flevit.
31 Rursumque lota facie egressus, continuit se, et ait: Ponite panes.
32 Quibus appositis, seorsum Joseph, et seorsum fratribus, Ægyptiis quoque qui vescebantur simul, seorsum (illicitum est enim Ægyptiis comedere cum Hebræis, et profanum putant hujuscemodi convivium)
33 sederunt coram eo, primogenitus juxta primogenita sua, et minimus juxta ætatem suam. Et mirabantur nimis,
34 sumptis partibus quas ab eo acceperant: majorque pars venit Benjamin, ita ut quinque partibus excederet. Biberuntque et inebriati sunt cum eo.

1 ὁ δὲ λιμὸς ἐνίσχυσεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
2 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα συνετέλεσαν καταφαγεῖν τὸν σῖτον ὃν ἤνεγκαν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν πάλιν πορευθέντες πρίασθε ἡμῖν μικρὰ βρώματα
3 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Ιουδας λέγων διαμαρτυρίᾳ διαμεμαρτύρηται ἡμῖν ὁ ἄνθρωπος λέγων οὐκ ὄψεσθε τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐὰν μὴ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος με{Q'} ὑμῶν ᾖ
4 εἰ μὲν οὖν ἀποστέλλεις τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἡμῶν με{Q'} ἡμῶν καταβησόμεθα καὶ ἀγοράσωμέν σοι βρώματα
5 εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀποστέλλεις τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἡμῶν με{Q'} ἡμῶν οὐ πορευσόμεθα ὁ γὰρ ἄνθρωπος εἶπεν ἡμῖν λέγων οὐκ ὄψεσθέ μου τὸ πρόσωπον ἐὰν μὴ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος με{Q'} ὑμῶν ᾖ
6 εἶπεν δὲ Ισραηλ τί ἐκακοποιήσατέ με ἀναγγείλαντες τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ εἰ ἔστιν ὑμῖν ἀδελφός
7 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν ἐρωτῶν ἐπηρώτησεν ἡμᾶς ὁ ἄνθρωπος καὶ τὴν γενεὰν ἡμῶν λέγων εἰ ἔτι ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ζῇ εἰ ἔστιν ὑμῖν ἀδελφός καὶ ἀπηγγείλαμεν αὐτῷ κατὰ τὴν ἐπερώτησιν ταύτην μὴ ᾔδειμεν εἰ ἐρεῖ ἡμῖν ἀγάγετε τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν
8 εἶπεν δὲ Ιουδας πρὸς Ισραηλ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ ἀπόστειλον τὸ παιδάριον με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀναστάντες πορευσόμεθα ἵνα ζῶμεν καὶ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ σὺ καὶ ἡ ἀποσκευὴ ἡμῶν
9 ἐγὼ δὲ ἐκδέχομαι αὐτόν ἐκ χειρός μου ζήτησον αὐτόν ἐὰν μὴ ἀγάγω αὐτὸν πρὸς σὲ καὶ στήσω αὐτὸν ἐναντίον σου ἡμαρτηκὼς ἔσομαι πρὸς σὲ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
10 εἰ μὴ γὰρ ἐβραδύναμεν ἤδη ἂν ὑπεστρέψαμεν δίς

11 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ισραηλ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν εἰ οὕτως ἐστίν τοῦτο ποιήσατε λάβετε ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν τῆς γῆς ἐν τοῖς ἀγγείοις ὑμῶν καὶ καταγάγετε τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ δῶρα τῆς ῥητίνης καὶ τοῦ μέλιτος θυμίαμα καὶ στακτὴν καὶ τερέμινθον καὶ κάρυα
12 καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον δισσὸν λάβετε ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ὑμῶν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ ἀποστραφὲν ἐν τοῖς μαρσίπποις ὑμῶν ἀποστρέψατε με{Q'} ὑμῶν μήποτε ἀγνόημά ἐστιν
13 καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν λάβετε καὶ ἀναστάντες κατάβητε πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον
14 ὁ δὲ θεός μου δῴη ὑμῖν χάριν ἐναντίον τοῦ ἀνθρώπου καὶ ἀποστείλαι τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν τὸν ἕνα καὶ τὸν Βενιαμιν ἐγὼ μὲν γάρ καθὰ ἠτέκνωμαι ἠτέκνωμαι
15 λαβόντες δὲ οἱ ἄνδρες τὰ δῶρα ταῦτα καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον διπλοῦν ἔλαβον ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν καὶ τὸν Βενιαμιν καὶ ἀναστάντες κατέβησαν εἰς Αἴγυπτον καὶ ἔστησαν ἐναντίον Ιωσηφ

16 εἶδεν δὲ Ιωσηφ αὐτοὺς καὶ τὸν Βενιαμιν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν ὁμομήτριον καὶ εἶπεν τῷ ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ εἰσάγαγε τοὺς ἀνθρώπους εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ σφάξον θύματα καὶ ἑτοίμασον με{T'} ἐμοῦ γὰρ φάγονται οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἄρτους τὴν μεσημβρίαν
17 ἐποίησεν δὲ ὁ ἄνθρωπος καθὰ εἶπεν Ιωσηφ καὶ εἰσήγαγεν τοὺς ἀνθρώπους εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ιωσηφ
18 ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ὅτι εἰσήχθησαν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ιωσηφ εἶπαν διὰ τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ ἀποστραφὲν ἐν τοῖς μαρσίπποις ἡμῶν τὴν ἀρχὴν ἡμεῖς εἰσαγόμεθα τοῦ συκοφαντῆσαι ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐπιθέσθαι ἡμῖν τοῦ λαβεῖν ἡμᾶς εἰς παῖδας καὶ τοὺς ὄνους ἡμῶν
19 προσελθόντες δὲ πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ οἴκου Ιωσηφ ἐλάλησαν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ πυλῶνι τοῦ οἴκου
20 λέγοντες δεόμεθα κύριε κατέβημεν τὴν ἀρχὴν πρίασθαι βρώματα
21 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἤλθομεν εἰς τὸ καταλῦσαι καὶ ἠνοίξαμεν τοὺς μαρσίππους ἡμῶν καὶ τόδε τὸ ἀργύριον ἑκάστου ἐν τῷ μαρσίππῳ αὐτοῦ τὸ ἀργύριον ἡμῶν ἐν σταθμῷ ἀπεστρέψαμεν νῦν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ἡμῶν
22 καὶ ἀργύριον ἕτερον ἠνέγκαμεν με{Q'} ἑαυτῶν ἀγοράσαι βρώματα οὐκ οἴδαμεν τίς ἐνέβαλεν τὸ ἀργύριον εἰς τοὺς μαρσίππους ἡμῶν
23 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς ἵλεως ὑμῖν μὴ φοβεῖσθε ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ὁ θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν θησαυροὺς ἐν τοῖς μαρσίπποις ὑμῶν τὸ δὲ ἀργύριον ὑμῶν εὐδοκιμοῦν ἀπέχω καὶ ἐξήγαγεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὸν Συμεων
24 καὶ ἤνεγκεν ὕδωρ νίψαι τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν καὶ ἔδωκεν χορτάσματα τοῖς ὄνοις αὐτῶν

25 ἡτοίμασαν δὲ τὰ δῶρα ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν Ιωσηφ μεσημβρίας ἤκουσαν γὰρ ὅτι ἐκεῖ μέλλει ἀριστᾶν
26 εἰσῆλθεν δὲ Ιωσηφ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ τὰ δῶρα ἃ εἶχον ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν οἶκον καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
27 ἠρώτησεν δὲ αὐτούς πῶς ἔχετε καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς εἰ ὑγιαίνει ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ πρεσβύτερος ὃν εἴπατε ἔτι ζῇ
28 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν ὑγιαίνει ὁ παῖς σου ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν ἔτι ζῇ καὶ εἶπεν εὐλογητὸς ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος τῷ θεῷ καὶ κύψαντες προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ
29 ἀναβλέψας δὲ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς Ιωσηφ εἶδεν Βενιαμιν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν ὁμομήτριον καὶ εἶπεν οὗτος ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος ὃν εἴπατε πρός με ἀγαγεῖν καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεὸς ἐλεήσαι σε τέκνον
30 ἐταράχθη δὲ Ιωσηφ συνεστρέφετο γὰρ τὰ ἔντερα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐζήτει κλαῦσαι εἰσελθὼν δὲ εἰς τὸ ταμιεῖον ἔκλαυσεν ἐκεῖ
31 καὶ νιψάμενος τὸ πρόσωπον ἐξελθὼν ἐνεκρατεύσατο καὶ εἶπεν παράθετε ἄρτους
32 καὶ παρέθηκαν αὐτῷ μόνῳ καὶ αὐτοῖς κα{Q'} ἑαυτοὺς καὶ τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις τοῖς συνδειπνοῦσιν με{T'} αὐτοῦ κα{Q'} ἑαυτούς οὐ γὰρ ἐδύναντο οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι συνεσθίειν μετὰ τῶν Εβραίων ἄρτους βδέλυγμα γάρ ἐστιν τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις
33 ἐκάθισαν δὲ ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ὁ πρωτότοκος κατὰ τὰ πρεσβεῖα αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ νεώτερος κατὰ τὴν νεότητα αὐτοῦ ἐξίσταντο δὲ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ
34 ἦραν δὲ μερίδας πα{R'} αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτούς ἐμεγαλύνθη δὲ ἡ μερὶς Βενιαμιν παρὰ τὰς μερίδας πάντων πενταπλασίως πρὸς τὰς ἐκείνων ἔπιον δὲ καὶ ἐμεθύσθησαν με{T'} αὐτοῦ
