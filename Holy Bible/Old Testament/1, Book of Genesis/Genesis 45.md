# Book of Genesis 45 (RSVCE)

### Joseph Reveals Himself to His Brothers
1 Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him; and he cried, “Make every one go out from me.” So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
2 And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.
3 And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph; is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
4 So Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, I pray you.” And they came near. And he said, “I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.
5 And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life.
6 For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
7 And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.
8 So it was not you who sent me here, but God; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
9 Make haste and go up to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry;
10 you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children’s children, and your flocks, your herds, and all that you have;
11 and there I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come; lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.’
12 And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
13 You must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Make haste and bring my father down here.”
14 Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
15 And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.
16 When the report was heard in Pharaoh’s house, “Joseph’s brothers have come,” it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well.
17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan;
18 and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.’
19 Command them also, ‘Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
20 Give no thought to your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’ ”
21 The sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.
22 To each and all of them he gave festal garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five festal garments.
23 To his father he sent as follows: ten asses loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey.
24 Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, “Do not quarrel on the way.”
25 So they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob.
26 And they told him, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them.
27 But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived;
28 and Israel said, “It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive; I will go and see him before I die.”


# Liber Genesis 45 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Non se poterat ultra cohibere Joseph multis coram astantibus: unde præcepit ut egrederentur cuncti foras, et nullus interesset alienus agnitioni mutuæ.
2 Elevavitque vocem cum fletu, quam audierunt Ægyptii, omnisque domus Pharaonis.
3 Et dixit fratribus suis: Ego sum Joseph: adhuc pater meus vivit? Non poterant respondere fratres nimio terrore perterriti.
4 Ad quos ille clementer: Accedite, inquit, ad me. Et cum accessissent prope: Ego sum, ait, Joseph, frater vester, quem vendidistis in Ægyptum.
5 Nolite pavere, neque vobis durum esse videatur quod vendidistis me in his regionibus: pro salute enim vestra misit me Deus ante vos in Ægyptum.
6 Biennium est enim quod cœpit fames esse in terra: et adhuc quinque anni restant, quibus nec arari poterit, nec meti.
7 Præmisitque me Deus ut reservemini super terram, et escas ad vivendum habere possitis.
8 Non vestro consilio, sed Dei voluntate huc missum sum: qui fecit me quasi patrem Pharaonis, et dominum universæ domus ejus, ac principem in omni terra Ægypti.

9 Festinate, et ascendite ad patrem meum, et dicetis ei: Hæc mandat filius tuus Joseph: Deus fecit me dominum universæ terræ Ægypti: descende ad me, ne moreris,
10 et habitabis in terra Gessen: erisque juxta me tu, et filii tui, et filii filiorum tuorum, oves tuæ, et armenta tua, et universa quæ possides:
11 ibique te pascam (adhuc enim quinque anni residui sunt famis) ne et tu pereas, et domus tua, et omnia quæ possides.
12 En oculi vestri, et oculi fratris mei Benjamin, vident quod os meum loquatur ad vos.
13 Nuntiate patri meo universam gloriam meam, et cuncta quæ vidistis in Ægypto: festinate, et adducite eum ad me.

14 Cumque amplexatus recidisset in collum Benjamin fratris sui, flevit: illo quoque similiter flente super collum ejus.
15 Osculatusque est Joseph omnes fratres suos, et ploravit super singulos: post quæ ausi sunt loqui ad eum.
16 Auditumque est, et celebri sermone vulgatum in aula regis: Venerunt fratres Joseph: et gavisus est Pharao, atque omnis familia ejus.
17 Dixitque ad Joseph ut imperaret fratribus suis, dicens: Onerantes jumenta, ite in terram Chanaan,
18 et tollite inde patrem vestrum et cognationem, et venite ad me: et ego dabo vobis omnia bona Ægypti, ut comedatis medullam terræ.
19 Præcipe etiam ut tollant plaustra de terra Ægypti, ad subvectionem parvulorum suorum ac conjugum: et dicito: Tollite patrem vestrum, et properate quantocius venientes.
20 Nec dimittatis quidquam de supellectili vestra: quia omnes opes Ægypti vestræ erunt.

21 Feceruntque filii Israël ut eis mandatum fuerat. Quibus dedit Joseph plaustra, secundum Pharaonis imperium, et cibaria in itinere.
22 Singulis quoque proferri jussit binas stolas: Benjamin vero dedit trecentos argenteos cum quinque stolis optimis:
23 tantumdem pecuniæ et vestium mittens patri suo, addens et asinos decem, qui subveherent ex omnibus divitiis Ægypti, et totidem asinas, triticum in itinere, panesque portantes.
24 Dimisit ergo fratres suos, et proficiscentibus ait: Ne irascamini in via.
25 Qui ascendentes ex Ægypto, venerunt in terram Chanaan ad patrem suum Jacob.
26 Et nuntiaverunt ei, dicentes: Joseph filius tuus vivit: et ipse dominatur in omni terra Ægypti. Quo audito Jacob, quasi de gravi somno evigilans, tamen non credebat eis.
27 Illi e contra referebant omnem ordinem rei. Cumque vidisset plaustra et universa quæ miserat, revixit spiritus ejus,
28 et ait: Sufficit mihi si adhuc Joseph filius meus vivit: vadam, et videbo illum antequam moriar.

1 καὶ οὐκ ἠδύνατο Ιωσηφ ἀνέχεσθαι πάντων τῶν παρεστηκότων αὐτῷ ἀλ{L'} εἶπεν ἐξαποστείλατε πάντας ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ οὐ παρειστήκει οὐδεὶς ἔτι τῷ Ιωσηφ ἡνίκα ἀνεγνωρίζετο τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ ἀφῆκεν φωνὴν μετὰ κλαυθμοῦ ἤκουσαν δὲ πάντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι καὶ ἀκουστὸν ἐγένετο εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φαραω
3 εἶπεν δὲ Ιωσηφ πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐγώ εἰμι Ιωσηφ ἔτι ὁ πατήρ μου ζῇ καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἀποκριθῆναι αὐτῷ ἐταράχθησαν γάρ
4 εἶπεν δὲ Ιωσηφ πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐγγίσατε πρός με καὶ ἤγγισαν καὶ εἶπεν ἐγώ εἰμι Ιωσηφ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὃν ἀπέδοσθε εἰς Αἴγυπτον
5 νῦν οὖν μὴ λυπεῖσθε μηδὲ σκληρὸν ὑμῖν φανήτω ὅτι ἀπέδοσθέ με ὧδε εἰς γὰρ ζωὴν ἀπέστειλέν με ὁ θεὸς ἔμπροσθεν ὑμῶν
6 τοῦτο γὰρ δεύτερον ἔτος λιμὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἔτι λοιπὰ πέντε ἔτη ἐν οἷς οὐκ ἔσται ἀροτρίασις οὐδὲ ἄμητος
7 ἀπέστειλεν γάρ με ὁ θεὸς ἔμπροσθεν ὑμῶν ὑπολείπεσθαι ὑμῶν κατάλειμμα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐκθρέψαι ὑμῶν κατάλειψιν μεγάλην
8 νῦν οὖν οὐχ ὑμεῖς με ἀπεστάλκατε ὧδε ἀλ{L'} ἢ ὁ θεός καὶ ἐποίησέν με ὡς πατέρα Φαραω καὶ κύριον παντὸς τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἄρχοντα πάσης γῆς Αἰγύπτου

9 σπεύσαντες οὖν ἀνάβητε πρὸς τὸν πατέρα μου καὶ εἴπατε αὐτῷ τάδε λέγει ὁ υἱός σου Ιωσηφ ἐποίησέν με ὁ θεὸς κύριον πάσης γῆς Αἰγύπτου κατάβηθι οὖν πρός με καὶ μὴ μείνῃς
10 καὶ κατοικήσεις ἐν γῇ Γεσεμ Ἀραβίας καὶ ἔσῃ ἐγγύς μου σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν υἱῶν σου τὰ πρόβατά σου καὶ αἱ βόες σου καὶ ὅσα σοί ἐστιν
11 καὶ ἐκθρέψω σε ἐκεῖ ἔτι γὰρ πέντε ἔτη λιμός ἵνα μὴ ἐκτριβῇς σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντά σου
12 ἰδοὺ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ὑμῶν βλέπουσιν καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ Βενιαμιν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου ὅτι τὸ στόμα μου τὸ λαλοῦν πρὸς ὑμᾶς
13 ἀπαγγείλατε οὖν τῷ πατρί μου πᾶσαν τὴν δόξαν μου τὴν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ὅσα εἴδετε καὶ ταχύναντες καταγάγετε τὸν πατέρα μου ὧδε

14 καὶ ἐπιπεσὼν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον Βενιαμιν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ ἔκλαυσεν ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ καὶ Βενιαμιν ἔκλαυσεν ἐπὶ τῷ τραχήλῳ αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ καταφιλήσας πάντας τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἔκλαυσεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοῖς καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐλάλησαν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτόν
16 καὶ διεβοήθη ἡ φωνὴ εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φαραω λέγοντες ἥκασιν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Ιωσηφ ἐχάρη δὲ Φαραω καὶ ἡ θεραπεία αὐτοῦ
17 εἶπεν δὲ Φαραω πρὸς Ιωσηφ εἰπὸν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς σου τοῦτο ποιήσατε γεμίσατε τὰ πορεῖα ὑμῶν καὶ ἀπέλθατε εἰς γῆν Χανααν
18 καὶ παραλαβόντες τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα ὑμῶν ἥκετε πρός με καὶ δώσω ὑμῖν πάντων τῶν ἀγαθῶν Αἰγύπτου καὶ φάγεσθε τὸν μυελὸν τῆς γῆς
19 σὺ δὲ ἔντειλαι ταῦτα λαβεῖν αὐτοῖς ἁμάξας ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου τοῖς παιδίοις ὑμῶν καὶ ταῖς γυναιξίν καὶ ἀναλαβόντες τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν παραγίνεσθε
20 καὶ μὴ φείσησθε τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς τῶν σκευῶν ὑμῶν τὰ γὰρ πάντα ἀγαθὰ Αἰγύπτου ὑμῖν ἔσται

21 ἐποίησαν δὲ οὕτως οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἔδωκεν δὲ Ιωσηφ αὐτοῖς ἁμάξας κατὰ τὰ εἰρημένα ὑπὸ Φαραω τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἐπισιτισμὸν εἰς τὴν ὁδόν
22 καὶ πᾶσιν ἔδωκεν δισσὰς στολάς τῷ δὲ Βενιαμιν ἔδωκεν τριακοσίους χρυσοῦς καὶ πέντε ἐξαλλασσούσας στολάς
23 καὶ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπέστειλεν κατὰ τὰ αὐτὰ καὶ δέκα ὄνους αἴροντας ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἀγαθῶν Αἰγύπτου καὶ δέκα ἡμιόνους αἰρούσας ἄρτους τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς ὁδόν
24 ἐξαπέστειλεν δὲ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς μὴ ὀργίζεσθε ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ
25 καὶ ἀνέβησαν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἦλθον εἰς γῆν Χανααν πρὸς Ιακωβ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν
26 καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες ὅτι ὁ υἱός σου Ιωσηφ ζῇ καὶ αὐτὸς ἄρχει πάσης γῆς Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ διάνοια Ιακωβ οὐ γὰρ ἐπίστευσεν αὐτοῖς
27 ἐλάλησαν δὲ αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ ῥηθέντα ὑπὸ Ιωσηφ ὅσα εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἰδὼν δὲ τὰς ἁμάξας ἃς ἀπέστειλεν Ιωσηφ ὥστε ἀναλαβεῖν αὐτόν ἀνεζωπύρησεν τὸ πνεῦμα Ιακωβ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν
28 εἶπεν δὲ Ισραηλ μέγα μοί ἐστιν εἰ ἔτι Ιωσηφ ὁ υἱός μου ζῇ πορευθεὶς ὄψομαι αὐτὸν πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν με
