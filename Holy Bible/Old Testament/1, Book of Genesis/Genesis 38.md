# Book of Genesis 38 (RSVCE)

### Judah and Tamar
1 It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adulʹlamite, whose name was Hirah.
2 There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; he married her and went in to her,
3 and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.
4 Again she conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
5 Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. She was in Chezib when she bore him.
6 And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.
7 But Er, Judah’s first-born, was wicked in the sight of theLord; and theLordslew him.
8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.”
9 But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother’s wife he spilled the semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother.
10 And what he did was displeasing in the sight of theLord, and he slew him also.
11 Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, till Shelah my son grows up”—for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.
12 In course of time the wife of Judah, Shua’s daughter, died; and when Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
13 And when Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,”
14 she put off her widow’s garments, and put on a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage.
15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot, for she had covered her face.
16 He went over to her at the road side, and said, “Come, let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”
17 He answered, “I will send you a kid from the flock.” And she said, “Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?”
18 He said, “What pledge shall I give you?” She replied, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
19 Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.
20 When Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, he could not find her.
21 And he asked the men of the place, “Where is the harlot who was at Enaim by the wayside?” And they said, “No harlot has been here.”
22 So he returned to Judah, and said, “I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘No harlot has been here.’ ”
23 And Judah replied, “Let her keep the things as her own, lest we be laughed at; you see, I sent this kid, and you could not find her.”
24 About three months later Judah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; and moreover she is with child by harlotry.” And Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.”
25 As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, “By the man to whom these belong, I am with child.” And she said, “Mark, I pray you, whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff.”
26 Then Judah acknowledged them and said, “She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not lie with her again.
27 When the time of her delivery came, there were twins in her womb.
28 And when she was in labor, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, “This came out first.”
29 But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out; and she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” Therefore his name was called Perez.
30 Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zerah.


# Liber Genesis 38 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Eodem tempore, descendens Judas a fratribus suis, divertit ad virum Odollamitem, nomine Hiram.
2 Viditque ibi filiam hominis Chananæi, vocabulo Sue: et accepta uxore, ingressus est ad eam.
3 Quæ concepit, et peperit filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Her.
4 Rursumque concepto fœtu, natum filium vocavit Onan.
5 Tertium quoque peperit: quem appellavit Sela; quo nato, parere ultra cessavit.
6 Dedit autem Judas uxorem primogenito suo Her, nomine Thamar.
7 Fuit quoque Her primogenitus Judæ nequam in conspectu Domini: et ab eo occisus est.
8 Dixit ergo Judas ad Onan filium suum: Ingredere uxorem fratris tui, et sociare illi, ut suscites semen fratri tuo.
9 Ille sciens non sibi nasci filios, introiens ad uxorem fratris sui, semen fundebat in terram, ne liberi fratris nomine nascerentur.
10 Et idcirco percussit eum Dominus, quod rem detestabilem faceret.
11 Quam ob rem dixit Judas Thamar nurui suæ: Esto vidua in domo patris tui, donec crescat Sela filius meus: timebat enim ne et ipse moreretur, sicut fratres ejus. Quæ abiit, et habitavit in domo patris sui.

12 Evolutis autem multis diebus, mortua est filia Sue uxor Judæ: qui, post luctum consolatione suscepta, ascendebat ad tonsores ovium suarum, ipse et Hiras opilio gregis Odollamites, in Thamnas.
13 Nuntiatumque est Thamar quod socer illius ascenderet in Thamnas ad tondendas oves.
14 Quæ, depositis viduitatis vestibus, assumpsit theristrum: et mutato habitu, sedit in bivio itineris, quod ducit Thamnam: eo quod crevisset Sela, et non eum accepisset maritum.
15 Quam cum vidisset Judas, suspicatus est esse meretricem: operuerat enim vultum suum, ne agnosceretur.
16 Ingrediensque ad eam, ait: Dimitte me ut coëam tecum: nesciebat enim quod nurus sua esset. Qua respondente: Quid dabis mihi ut fruaris concubitu meo?
17 dixit: Mittam tibi hædum de gregibus. Rursumque illa dicente: Patiar quod vis, si dederis mihi arrhabonem, donec mittas quod polliceris.
18 Ait Judas: Quid tibi vis pro arrhabone dari? Respondit: Annulum tuum, et armillam, et baculum quem manu tenes. Ad unum igitur coitum mulier concepit,
19 et surgens abiit: depositoque habitu quem sumpserat, induta est viduitatis vestibus.

20 Misit autem Judas hædum per pastorem suum Odollamitem, ut reciperet pignus quod dederat mulieri: qui cum non invenisset eam,
21 interrogavit homines loci illius: Ubi est mulier quæ sedebat in bivio? Respondentibus cunctis: Non fuit in loco ista meretrix.
22 Reversus est ad Judam, et dixit ei: Non inveni eam: sed et homines loci illius dixerunt mihi, numquam sedisse ibi scortum.
23 Ait Judas: Habeat sibi, certe mendacii arguere nos non potest, ego misi hædum quem promiseram: et tu non invenisti eam.
24 Ecce autem post tres menses nuntiaverunt Judæ, dicentes: Fornicata est Thamar nurus tua, et videtur uterus illius intumescere. Dixitque Judas: Producite eam ut comburatur.
25 Quæ cum duceretur ad pœnam, misit ad socerum suum, dicens: De viro, cujus hæc sunt, concepi: cognosce cujus sit annulus, et armilla, et baculus.
26 Qui, agnitis muneribus, ait: Justior me est: quia non tradidi eam Sela filio meo. Attamen ultra non cognovit eam.

27 Instante autem partu, apparuerunt gemini in utero: atque in ipsa effusione infantium unus protulit manum, in qua obstetrix ligavit coccinum, dicens:
28 Iste egredietur prior.
29 Illo vero retrahente manum, egressus est alter: dixitque mulier: Quare divisa est propter te maceria? et ob hanc causam, vocavit nomen ejus Phares.
30 Postea egressus est frater ejus, in cujus manu erat coccinum: quem appellavit Zara.

1 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ κατέβη Ιουδας ἀπὸ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀφίκετο ἕως πρὸς ἄνθρωπόν τινα Οδολλαμίτην ᾧ ὄνομα Ιρας
2 καὶ εἶδεν ἐκεῖ Ιουδας θυγατέρα ἀνθρώπου Χαναναίου ᾗ ὄνομα Σαυα καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτήν
3 καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτεκεν υἱὸν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ηρ
4 καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτι ἔτεκεν υἱὸν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Αυναν
5 καὶ προσθεῖσα ἔτι ἔτεκεν υἱὸν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Σηλωμ αὐτὴ δὲ ἦν ἐν Χασβι ἡνίκα ἔτεκεν αὐτούς
6 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ιουδας γυναῖκα Ηρ τῷ πρωτοτόκῳ αὐτοῦ ᾗ ὄνομα Θαμαρ
7 ἐγένετο δὲ Ηρ πρωτότοκος Ιουδα πονηρὸς ἐναντίον κυρίου καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτὸν ὁ θεός
8 εἶπεν δὲ Ιουδας τῷ Αυναν εἴσελθε πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου καὶ γάμβρευσαι αὐτὴν καὶ ἀνάστησον σπέρμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου
9 γνοὺς δὲ Αυναν ὅτι οὐκ αὐτῷ ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα ἐγίνετο ὅταν εἰσήρχετο πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐξέχεεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι σπέρμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ
10 πονηρὸν δὲ ἐφάνη ἐναντίον τοῦ θεοῦ ὅτι ἐποίησεν τοῦτο καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν καὶ τοῦτον
11 εἶπεν δὲ Ιουδας Θαμαρ τῇ νύμφῃ αὐτοῦ κάθου χήρα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός σου ἕως μέγας γένηται Σηλωμ ὁ υἱός μου εἶπεν γάρ μήποτε ἀποθάνῃ καὶ οὗτος ὥσπερ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπελθοῦσα δὲ Θαμαρ ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς

12 ἐπληθύνθησαν δὲ αἱ ἡμέραι καὶ ἀπέθανεν Σαυα ἡ γυνὴ Ιουδα καὶ παρακληθεὶς Ιουδας ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τοὺς κείροντας τὰ πρόβατα αὐτοῦ αὐτὸς καὶ Ιρας ὁ ποιμὴν αὐτοῦ ὁ Οδολλαμίτης εἰς Θαμνα
13 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη Θαμαρ τῇ νύμφῃ αὐτοῦ λέγοντες ἰδοὺ ὁ πενθερός σου ἀναβαίνει εἰς Θαμνα κεῖραι τὰ πρόβατα αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ περιελομένη τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς χηρεύσεως ἀ{F'} ἑαυτῆς περιεβάλετο θέριστρον καὶ ἐκαλλωπίσατο καὶ ἐκάθισεν πρὸς ταῖς πύλαις Αιναν ἥ ἐστιν ἐν παρόδῳ Θαμνα εἶδεν γὰρ ὅτι μέγας γέγονεν Σηλωμ αὐτὸς δὲ οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα
15 καὶ ἰδὼν αὐτὴν Ιουδας ἔδοξεν αὐτὴν πόρνην εἶναι κατεκαλύψατο γὰρ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς καὶ οὐκ ἐπέγνω αὐτήν
16 ἐξέκλινεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὴν τὴν ὁδὸν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ἔασόν με εἰσελθεῖν πρὸς σέ οὐ γὰρ ἔγνω ὅτι ἡ νύμφη αὐτοῦ ἐστιν ἡ δὲ εἶπεν τί μοι δώσεις ἐὰν εἰσέλθῃς πρός με
17 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ἐγώ σοι ἀποστελῶ ἔριφον αἰγῶν ἐκ τῶν προβάτων ἡ δὲ εἶπεν ἐὰν δῷς ἀρραβῶνα ἕως τοῦ ἀποστεῖλαί σε
18 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν τίνα τὸν ἀρραβῶνά σοι δώσω ἡ δὲ εἶπεν τὸν δακτύλιόν σου καὶ τὸν ὁρμίσκον καὶ τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν ἐν τῇ χειρί σου καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτήν καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔλαβεν ἐξ αὐτοῦ
19 καὶ ἀναστᾶσα ἀπῆλθεν καὶ περιείλατο τὸ θέριστρον ἀ{F'} ἑαυτῆς καὶ ἐνεδύσατο τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς χηρεύσεως αὐτῆς

20 ἀπέστειλεν δὲ Ιουδας τὸν ἔριφον ἐξ αἰγῶν ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ ποιμένος αὐτοῦ τοῦ Οδολλαμίτου κομίσασθαι τὸν ἀρραβῶνα παρὰ τῆς γυναικός καὶ οὐχ εὗρεν αὐτήν
21 ἐπηρώτησεν δὲ τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς ἐκ τοῦ τόπου ποῦ ἐστιν ἡ πόρνη ἡ γενομένη ἐν Αιναν ἐπὶ τῆς ὁδοῦ καὶ εἶπαν οὐκ ἦν ἐνταῦθα πόρνη
22 καὶ ἀπεστράφη πρὸς Ιουδαν καὶ εἶπεν οὐχ εὗρον καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ ἐκ τοῦ τόπου λέγουσιν μὴ εἶναι ὧδε πόρνην
23 εἶπεν δὲ Ιουδας ἐχέτω αὐτά ἀλλὰ μήποτε καταγελασθῶμεν ἐγὼ μὲν ἀπέσταλκα τὸν ἔριφον τοῦτον σὺ δὲ οὐχ εὕρηκας
24 ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τρίμηνον ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ιουδα λέγοντες ἐκπεπόρνευκεν Θαμαρ ἡ νύμφη σου καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχει ἐκ πορνείας εἶπεν δὲ Ιουδας ἐξαγάγετε αὐτήν καὶ κατακαυθήτω
25 αὐτὴ δὲ ἀγομένη ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς τὸν πενθερὸν αὐτῆς λέγουσα ἐκ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τίνος ταῦτά ἐστιν ἐγὼ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχω καὶ εἶπεν ἐπίγνωθι τίνος ὁ δακτύλιος καὶ ὁ ὁρμίσκος καὶ ἡ ῥάβδος αὕτη
26 ἐπέγνω δὲ Ιουδας καὶ εἶπεν δεδικαίωται Θαμαρ ἢ ἐγώ οὗ εἵνεκεν οὐκ ἔδωκα αὐτὴν Σηλωμ τῷ υἱῷ μου καὶ οὐ προσέθετο ἔτι τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτήν

27 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἔτικτεν καὶ τῇδε ἦν δίδυμα ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ αὐτῆς
28 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ τίκτειν αὐτὴν ὁ εἷς προεξήνεγκεν τὴν χεῖρα λαβοῦσα δὲ ἡ μαῖα ἔδησεν ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ κόκκινον λέγουσα οὗτος ἐξελεύσεται πρότερος
29 ὡς δὲ ἐπισυνήγαγεν τὴν χεῖρα καὶ εὐθὺς ἐξῆλθεν ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἡ δὲ εἶπεν τί διεκόπη διὰ σὲ φραγμός καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Φαρες
30 καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἐξῆλθεν ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐ{F'} ᾧ ἦν ἐπὶ τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὸ κόκκινον καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ζαρα
