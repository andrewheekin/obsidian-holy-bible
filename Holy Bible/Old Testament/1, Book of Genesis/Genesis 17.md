### The Sign of the Covenant
1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old theLordappeared to Abram, and said to him, “I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless.
2 And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.”
3 Then Abram fell on his face; and God said to him,
4 “Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.
5 No longer shall your name be Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come forth from you.
7 And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you.
8 And I will give to you, and to your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”
9 And God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.
10 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your descendants after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
11 You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.
12 He that is eight days old among you shall be circumcised; every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house, or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring,
13 both he that is born in your house and he that is bought with your money, shall be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant.
14 Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”
15 And God said to Abraham, “As for Sarʹai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarʹai, but Sarah shall be her name.
16 I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her; I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.”
17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself, “Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”
18 And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishʹmael might live in thy sight!”
19 God said, “No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasing covenant for his descendants after him.
20 As for Ishʹmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him and make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly; he shall be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.
21 But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this season next year.”
22 When he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
23 Then Abraham took Ishʹmael his son and all the slaves born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him.
24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
25 And Ishʹmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
26 That very day Abraham and his son Ishʹmael were circumcised;
27 and all the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.


# Liber Genesis 17 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Postquam vero nonaginta et novem annorum esse cœperat, apparuit ei Dominus, dixitque ad eum: Ego Deus omnipotens: ambula coram me, et esto perfectus.
2 Ponamque fœdus meum inter me et te, et multiplicabo te vehementer nimis.
3 Cecidit Abram pronus in faciem.
4 Dixitque ei Deus: Ego sum, et pactum meum tecum, erisque pater multarum gentium.
5 Nec ultra vocabitur nomen tuum Abram, sed appellaberis Abraham: quia patrem multarum gentium constitui te.
6 Faciamque te crescere vehementissime, et ponam te in gentibus, regesque ex te egredientur.
7 Et statuam pactum meum inter me et te, et inter semen tuum post te in generationibus suis, fœdere sempiterno: ut sim Deus tuus, et seminis tui post te.
8 Daboque tibi et semini tuo terram peregrinationis tuæ, omnem terram Chanaan in possessionem æternam, eroque Deus eorum.

9 Dixit iterum Deus ad Abraham: Et tu ergo custodies pactum meum, et semen tuum post te in generationibus suis.
10 Hoc est pactum meum quod observabitis inter me et vos, et semen tuum post te: circumcidetur ex vobis omne masculinum:
11 et circumcidetis carnem præputii vestri, ut sit in signum fœderis inter me et vos.
12 Infans octo dierum circumcidetur in vobis, omne masculinum in generationibus vestris: tam vernaculus, quam emptitius circumcidetur, et quicumque non fuerit de stirpe vestra:
13 eritque pactum meum in carne vestra in fœdus æternum.
14 Masculus, cujus præputii caro circumcisa non fuerit, delebitur anima illa de populo suo: quia pactum meum irritum fecit.

15 Dixit quoque Deus ad Abraham: Sarai uxorem tuam non vocabis Sarai, sed Saram.
16 Et benedicam ei, et ex illa dabo tibi filium cui benedicturus sum: eritque in nationes, et reges populorum orientur ex eo.

17 Cecidit Abraham in faciem suam, et risit, dicens in corde suo: Putasne centenario nascetur filius? et Sara nonagenaria pariet?
18 Dixitque ad Deum: Utinam Ismaël vivat coram te.
19 Et ait Deus ad Abraham: Sara uxor tua pariet tibi filium, vocabisque nomen ejus Isaac, et constituam pactum meum illi in fœdus sempiternum, et semini ejus post eum.
20 Super Ismaël quoque exaudivi te: ecce, benedicam ei, et augebo, et multiplicabo eum valde: duodecim duces generabit, et faciam illum in gentem magnam.
21 Pactum vero meum statuam ad Isaac, quem pariet tibi Sara tempore isto in anno altero.

22 Cumque finitus esset sermo loquentis cum eo, ascendit Deus ab Abraham.
23 Tulit autem Abraham Ismaël filium suum, et omnes vernaculos domus suæ, universosque quos emerat, cunctos mares ex omnibus viris domus suæ: et circumcidit carnem præputii eorum statim in ipsa die, sicut præceperat ei Deus.
24 Abraham nonaginta et novem erat annorum quando circumcidit carnem præputii sui.
25 Et Ismaël filius tredecim annos impleverat tempore circumcisionis suæ.
26 Eadem die circumcisus est Abraham et Ismaël filius ejus:
27 et omnes viri domus illius, tam vernaculi, quam emptitii et alienigenæ pariter circumcisi sunt.

1 ἐγένετο δὲ Αβραμ ἐτῶν ἐνενήκοντα ἐννέα καὶ ὤφθη κύριος τῷ Αβραμ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ θεός σου εὐαρέστει ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ καὶ γίνου ἄμεμπτος
2 καὶ θήσομαι τὴν διαθήκην μου ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον σοῦ καὶ πληθυνῶ σε σφόδρα
3 καὶ ἔπεσεν Αβραμ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ ὁ θεὸς λέγων
4 καὶ ἐγὼ ἰδοὺ ἡ διαθήκη μου μετὰ σοῦ καὶ ἔσῃ πατὴρ πλήθους ἐθνῶν
5 καὶ οὐ κληθήσεται ἔτι τὸ ὄνομά σου Αβραμ ἀλ{L'} ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά σου Αβρααμ ὅτι πατέρα πολλῶν ἐθνῶν τέθεικά σε
6 καὶ αὐξανῶ σε σφόδρα σφόδρα καὶ θήσω σε εἰς ἔθνη καὶ βασιλεῖς ἐκ σοῦ ἐξελεύσονται
7 καὶ στήσω τὴν διαθήκην μου ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον σοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σπέρματός σου μετὰ σὲ εἰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν εἰς διαθήκην αἰώνιον εἶναί σου θεὸς καὶ τοῦ σπέρματός σου μετὰ σέ
8 καὶ δώσω σοι καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου μετὰ σὲ τὴν γῆν ἣν παροικεῖς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Χανααν εἰς κατάσχεσιν αἰώνιον καὶ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς θεός

9 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεὸς πρὸς Αβρααμ σὺ δὲ τὴν διαθήκην μου διατηρήσεις σὺ καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου μετὰ σὲ εἰς τὰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν
10 καὶ αὕτη ἡ διαθήκη ἣν διατηρήσεις ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ὑμῶν καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σπέρματός σου μετὰ σὲ εἰς τὰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν περιτμηθήσεται ὑμῶν πᾶν ἀρσενικόν
11 καὶ περιτμηθήσεσθε τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας ὑμῶν καὶ ἔσται ἐν σημείῳ διαθήκης ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ὑμῶν
12 καὶ παιδίον ὀκτὼ ἡμερῶν περιτμηθήσεται ὑμῖν πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν ὁ οἰκογενὴς τῆς οἰκίας σου καὶ ὁ ἀργυρώνητος ἀπὸ παντὸς υἱοῦ ἀλλοτρίου ὃς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματός σου
13 περιτομῇ περιτμηθήσεται ὁ οἰκογενὴς τῆς οἰκίας σου καὶ ὁ ἀργυρώνητος καὶ ἔσται ἡ διαθήκη μου ἐπὶ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν εἰς διαθήκην αἰώνιον
14 καὶ ἀπερίτμητος ἄρσην ὃς οὐ περιτμηθήσεται τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτοῦ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐκ τοῦ γένους αὐτῆς ὅτι τὴν διαθήκην μου διεσκέδασεν

15 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ θεὸς τῷ Αβρααμ Σαρα ἡ γυνή σου οὐ κληθήσεται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς Σαρα ἀλλὰ Σαρρα ἔσται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς
16 εὐλογήσω δὲ αὐτὴν καὶ δώσω σοι ἐξ αὐτῆς τέκνον καὶ εὐλογήσω αὐτόν καὶ ἔσται εἰς ἔθνη καὶ βασιλεῖς ἐθνῶν ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἔσονται

17 καὶ ἔπεσεν Αβρααμ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον καὶ ἐγέλασεν καὶ εἶπεν ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ αὐτοῦ λέγων εἰ τῷ ἑκατονταετεῖ γενήσεται καὶ εἰ Σαρρα ἐνενήκοντα ἐτῶν οὖσα τέξεται
18 εἶπεν δὲ Αβρααμ πρὸς τὸν θεόν Ισμαηλ οὗτος ζήτω ἐναντίον σου
19 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ θεὸς τῷ Αβρααμ ναί ἰδοὺ Σαρρα ἡ γυνή σου τέξεταί σοι υἱόν καὶ καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ισαακ καὶ στήσω τὴν διαθήκην μου πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς διαθήκην αἰώνιον καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτόν
20 περὶ δὲ Ισμαηλ ἰδοὺ ἐπήκουσά σου ἰδοὺ εὐλόγησα αὐτὸν καὶ αὐξανῶ αὐτὸν καὶ πληθυνῶ αὐτὸν σφόδρα δώδεκα ἔθνη γεννήσει καὶ δώσω αὐτὸν εἰς ἔθνος μέγα
21 τὴν δὲ διαθήκην μου στήσω πρὸς Ισαακ ὃν τέξεταί σοι Σαρρα εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ ἑτέρῳ

22 συνετέλεσεν δὲ λαλῶν πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ θεὸς ἀπὸ Αβρααμ
23 καὶ ἔλαβεν Αβρααμ Ισμαηλ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντας τοὺς οἰκογενεῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀργυρωνήτους καὶ πᾶν ἄρσεν τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Αβρααμ καὶ περιέτεμεν τὰς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης καθὰ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ ὁ θεός
24 Αβρααμ δὲ ἦν ἐνενήκοντα ἐννέα ἐτῶν ἡνίκα περιέτεμεν τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτοῦ
25 Ισμαηλ δὲ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἐτῶν δέκα τριῶν ἦν ἡνίκα περιετμήθη τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτοῦ
26 ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης περιετμήθη Αβρααμ καὶ Ισμαηλ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ
27 καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ οἰκογενεῖς καὶ οἱ ἀργυρώνητοι ἐξ ἀλλογενῶν ἐθνῶν περιέτεμεν αὐτούς
