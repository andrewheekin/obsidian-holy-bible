# Book of Genesis 50 (RSVCE)

1 Then Joseph fell on his father’s face, and wept over him, and kissed him.
2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel;
3 forty days were required for it, for so many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
4 And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
5 My father made me swear, saying, ‘I am about to die: in my tomb which I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.’ Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father; then I will return.”
6 And Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.”
7 So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
8 as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s household; only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen.
9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; it was a very great company.
10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Aʹbel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan.
12 Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them;
13 for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field at Mach-peʹlah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite, to possess as a burying place.
14 After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
### Joseph Forgives His Brothers
15 When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.”
16 So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died,
17 ‘Say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.’ And now, we pray you, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
18 His brothers also came and fell down before him, and said, “Behold, we are your servants.”
19 But Joseph said to them, “Fear not, for am I in the place of God?
20 As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.
21 So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he reassured them and comforted them.
### Joseph’s Last Days and Death
22 So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father’s house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
23 And Joseph saw Eʹphraim’s children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manasʹseh were born upon Joseph’s knees.
24 And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die; but God will visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”
25 Then Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, “God will visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”
26 So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.


# Liber Genesis 50 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Quod cernens Joseph, ruit super faciem patris, flens et deosculans eum.
2 Præcepitque servis suis medicis ut aromatibus condirent patrem.
3 Quibus jussa explentibus, transierunt quadraginta dies: iste quippe mos erat cadaverum conditorum: flevitque eum Ægyptus septuaginta diebus.
4 Et expleto planctus tempore, locutus est Joseph ad familiam Pharaonis: Si inveni gratiam in conspectu vestro, loquimini in auribus Pharaonis:
5 eo quod pater meus adjuraverit me dicens: En morior: in sepulchro meo, quod fodi mihi in terra Chanaan, sepelies me. Ascendam igitur, et sepeliam patrem meum, ac revertar.
6 Dixitque ei Pharao: Ascende, et sepeli patrem tuum sicut adjuratus es.
7 Quo ascendente, ierunt cum eo omnes senes domus Pharaonis, cunctique majores natu terræ Ægypti:
8 domus Joseph cum fratribus suis, absque parvulis, et gregibus atque armentis, quæ dereliquerant in terra Gessen.
9 Habuit quoque in comitatu currus et equites: et facta est turba non modica.
10 Veneruntque ad Aream Atad, quæ sita est trans Jordanem: ubi celebrantes exequias planctu magno atque vehementi impleverunt septem dies.
11 Quod cum vidissent habitatores terræ Chanaan, dixerunt: Planctus magnus est iste Ægyptiis. Et idcirco vocatum est nomen loci illius, Planctus Ægypti.
12 Fecerunt ergo filii Jacob sicut præceperat eis:
13 et portantes eum in terram Chanaan, sepelierunt eum in spelunca duplici, quam emerat Abraham cum agro in possessionem sepulchri ab Ephron Hethæo, contra faciem Mambre.

14 Reversusque est Joseph in Ægyptum cum fratribus suis, et omni comitatu, sepulto patre.
15 Quo mortuo, timentes fratres ejus, et mutuo colloquentes: Ne forte memor sit injuriæ quam passus est, et reddat nobis omne malum quod fecimus,
16 mandaverunt ei dicentes: Pater tuus præcepit nobis antequam moreretur,
17 ut hæc tibi verbis illius diceremus: Obsecro ut obliviscaris sceleris fratrum tuorum, et peccati atque malitiæ quam exercuerunt in te: nos quoque oramus ut servis Dei patris tui dimittas iniquitatem hanc. Quibus auditis flevit Joseph.
18 Veneruntque ad eum fratres sui: et proni adorantes in terram, dixerunt: Servi tui sumus.
19 Quibus ille respondit: Nolite timere: num Dei possumus resistere voluntati?
20 Vos cogitastis de me malum: sed Deus vertit illud in bonum, ut exaltaret me, sicut in præsentiarum cernitis, et salvos faceret multos populos.
21 Nolite timere: ego pascam vos et parvulos vestros: consolatusque est eos, et blande ac leniter est locutus.

22 Et vidit Ephraim filios usque ad tertiam generationem. Filii quoque Machir filii Manasse nati sunt in genibus Joseph.
23 Quibus transactis, locutus est fratribus suis: Post mortem meam Deus visitabit vos, et ascendere vos faciet de terra ista ad terram quam juravit Abraham, Isaac et Jacob.
24 Cumque adjurasset eos atque dixisset: Deus visitabit vos, asportate ossa mea vobiscum de loco isto:
25 mortuus est, expletis centum decem vitæ suæ annis. Et conditus aromatibus, repositus est in loculo in Ægypto.

1 καὶ ἐπιπεσὼν Ιωσηφ ἐπὶ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἔκλαυσεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν καὶ ἐφίλησεν αὐτόν
2 καὶ προσέταξεν Ιωσηφ τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ τοῖς ἐνταφιασταῖς ἐνταφιάσαι τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐνεταφίασαν οἱ ἐνταφιασταὶ τὸν Ισραηλ
3 καὶ ἐπλήρωσαν αὐτοῦ τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας οὕτως γὰρ καταριθμοῦνται αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς ταφῆς καὶ ἐπένθησεν αὐτὸν Αἴγυπτος ἑβδομήκοντα ἡμέρας
4 ἐπειδὴ δὲ παρῆλθον αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ πένθους ἐλάλησεν Ιωσηφ πρὸς τοὺς δυνάστας Φαραω λέγων εἰ εὗρον χάριν ἐναντίον ὑμῶν λαλήσατε περὶ ἐμοῦ εἰς τὰ ὦτα Φαραω λέγοντες
5 ὁ πατήρ μου ὥρκισέν με λέγων ἐν τῷ μνημείῳ ᾧ ὤρυξα ἐμαυτῷ ἐν γῇ Χανααν ἐκεῖ με θάψεις νῦν οὖν ἀναβὰς θάψω τὸν πατέρα μου καὶ ἐπανελεύσομαι
6 καὶ εἶπεν Φαραω ἀνάβηθι θάψον τὸν πατέρα σου καθάπερ ὥρκισέν σε
7 καὶ ἀνέβη Ιωσηφ θάψαι τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ συνανέβησαν με{T'} αὐτοῦ πάντες οἱ παῖδες Φαραω καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντες οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τῆς γῆς Αἰγύπτου
8 καὶ πᾶσα ἡ πανοικία Ιωσηφ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσα ἡ οἰκία ἡ πατρικὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν συγγένειαν καὶ τὰ πρόβατα καὶ τοὺς βόας ὑπελίποντο ἐν γῇ Γεσεμ
9 καὶ συνανέβησαν με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἅρματα καὶ ἱππεῖς καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ παρεμβολὴ μεγάλη σφόδρα
10 καὶ παρεγένοντο ἐ{F'} ἅλωνα Αταδ ὅ ἐστιν πέραν τοῦ Ιορδάνου καὶ ἐκόψαντο αὐτὸν κοπετὸν μέγαν καὶ ἰσχυρὸν σφόδρα καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πένθος τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας
11 καὶ εἶδον οἱ κάτοικοι τῆς γῆς Χανααν τὸ πένθος ἐν ἅλωνι Αταδ καὶ εἶπαν πένθος μέγα τοῦτό ἐστιν τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Πένθος Αἰγύπτου ὅ ἐστιν πέραν τοῦ Ιορδάνου
12 καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτῷ οὕτως οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ
13 καὶ ἀνέλαβον αὐτὸν οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς γῆν Χανααν καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον τὸ διπλοῦν ὃ ἐκτήσατο Αβρααμ τὸ σπήλαιον ἐν κτήσει μνημείου παρὰ Εφρων τοῦ Χετταίου κατέναντι Μαμβρη

14 καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Ιωσηφ εἰς Αἴγυπτον αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ συναναβάντες θάψαι τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ
15 ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Ιωσηφ ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν εἶπαν μήποτε μνησικακήσῃ ἡμῖν Ιωσηφ καὶ ἀνταπόδομα ἀνταποδῷ ἡμῖν πάντα τὰ κακά ἃ ἐνεδειξάμεθα αὐτῷ
16 καὶ παρεγένοντο πρὸς Ιωσηφ λέγοντες ὁ πατήρ σου ὥρκισεν πρὸ τοῦ τελευτῆσαι αὐτὸν λέγων
17 οὕτως εἴπατε Ιωσηφ ἄφες αὐτοῖς τὴν ἀδικίαν καὶ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν αὐτῶν ὅτι πονηρά σοι ἐνεδείξαντο καὶ νῦν δέξαι τὴν ἀδικίαν τῶν θεραπόντων τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ πατρός σου καὶ ἔκλαυσεν Ιωσηφ λαλούντων αὐτῶν πρὸς αὐτόν
18 καὶ ἐλθόντες πρὸς αὐτὸν εἶπαν οἵδε ἡμεῖς σοι οἰκέται
19 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ μὴ φοβεῖσθε τοῦ γὰρ θεοῦ εἰμι ἐγώ
20 ὑμεῖς ἐβουλεύσασθε κα{T'} ἐμοῦ εἰς πονηρά ὁ δὲ θεὸς ἐβουλεύσατο περὶ ἐμοῦ εἰς ἀγαθά ὅπως ἂν γενηθῇ ὡς σήμερον ἵνα διατραφῇ λαὸς πολύς
21 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς μὴ φοβεῖσθε ἐγὼ διαθρέψω ὑμᾶς καὶ τὰς οἰκίας ὑμῶν καὶ παρεκάλεσεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῶν εἰς τὴν καρδίαν

22 καὶ εἶδεν Ιωσηφ Εφραιμ παιδία ἕως τρίτης γενεᾶς καὶ υἱοὶ Μαχιρ τοῦ υἱοῦ Μανασση ἐτέχθησαν ἐπὶ μηρῶν Ιωσηφ
23 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωσηφ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ λέγων ἐγὼ ἀποθνῄσκω ἐπισκοπῇ δὲ ἐπισκέψεται ὑμᾶς ὁ θεὸς καὶ ἀνάξει ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῆς γῆς ταύτης εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ὤμοσεν ὁ θεὸς τοῖς πατράσιν ἡμῶν Αβρααμ καὶ Ισαακ καὶ Ιακωβ
24 καὶ ὥρκισεν Ιωσηφ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ λέγων ἐν τῇ ἐπισκοπῇ ᾗ ἐπισκέψεται ὑμᾶς ὁ θεός καὶ συνανοίσετε τὰ ὀστᾶ μου ἐντεῦθεν με{Q'} ὑμῶν
25 καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν Ιωσηφ ἐτῶν ἑκατὸν δέκα καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν καὶ ἔθηκαν ἐν τῇ σορῷ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ
