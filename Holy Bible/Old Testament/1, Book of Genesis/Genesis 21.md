# Book of Genesis 21 (RSVCE)

### The Birth of Isaac
1 TheLordvisited Sarah as he had said, and theLorddid to Sarah as he had promised.
2 And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him.
3 Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac.
4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
5 Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
6 And Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; every one who hears will laugh over me.”
7 And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would suckle children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
### Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away
8 And the child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
9 But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac.
10 So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.”
11 And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
12 But God said to Abraham, “Be not displeased because of the lad and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your descendants be named.
13 And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.”
14 So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
15 When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child under one of the bushes.
16 Then she went, and sat down over against him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, “Let me not look upon the death of the child.” And as she sat over against him, the child lifted up his voice and wept.
17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not; for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him fast with your hand; for I will make him a great nation.”
19 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink.
20 And God was with the lad, and he grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow.
21 He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
### Abraham and Abimelech Make a Covenant
22 At that time Abimʹelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do;
23 now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but as I have dealt loyally with you, you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.”
24 And Abraham said, “I will swear.”
25 When Abraham complained to Abimʹelech about a well of water which Abimʹelech’s servants had seized,
26 Abimʹelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.”
27 So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimʹelech, and the two men made a covenant.
28 Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.
29 And Abimʹelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set apart?”
30 He said, “These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that you may be a witness for me that I dug this well.”
31 Therefore that place was called Beer-sheba; because there both of them swore an oath.
32 So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. Then Abimʹelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of theLord, the Everlasting God.
34 And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.


# Liber Genesis 21 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Visitavit autem Dominus Saram, sicut promiserat: et implevit quæ locutus est.
2 Concepitque et peperit filium in senectute sua, tempore quo prædixerat ei Deus.
3 Vocavitque Abraham nomen filii sui, quem genuit ei Sara, Isaac:
4 et circumcidit eum octavo die, sicut præceperat ei Deus,
5 cum centum esset annorum: hac quippe ætate patris, natus est Isaac.
6 Dixitque Sara: Risum fecit mihi Deus: quicumque audierit, corridebit mihi.
7 Rursumque ait: Quis auditurus crederet Abraham quod Sara lactaret filium, quem peperit ei jam seni?

8 Crevit igitur puer, et ablactatus est: fecitque Abraham grande convivium in die ablactationis ejus.
9 Cumque vidisset Sara filium Agar Ægyptiæ ludentem cum Isaac filio suo, dixit ad Abraham:
10 Ejice ancillam hanc, et filium ejus: non enim erit hæres filius ancillæ cum filio meo Isaac.
11 Dure accepit hoc Abraham pro filio suo.
12 Cui dixit Deus: Non tibi videatur asperum super puero, et super ancilla tua: omnia quæ dixerit tibi Sara, audi vocem ejus: quia in Isaac vocabitur tibi semen.
13 Sed et filium ancillæ faciam in gentem magnam, quia semen tuum est.
14 Surrexit itaque Abraham mane, et tollens panem et utrem aquæ, imposuit scapulæ ejus, tradiditque puerum, et dimisit eam. Quæ cum abiisset, errabat in solitudine Bersabee.
15 Cumque consumpta esset aqua in utre, abjecit puerum subter unam arborum, quæ ibi erant.
16 Et abiit, seditque e regione procul quantum potest arcus jacere: dixit enim: Non videbo morientem puerum: et sedens contra, levavit vocem suam et flevit.
17 Exaudivit autem Deus vocem pueri: vocavitque angelus Dei Agar de cælo, dicens: Quid agis Agar? noli timere: exaudivit enim Deus vocem pueri de loco in quo est.
18 Surge, tolle puerum, et tene manum illius: quia in gentem magnam faciam eum.
19 Aperuitque oculos ejus Deus: quæ videns puteum aquæ, abiit, et implevit utrem, deditque puero bibere.
20 Et fuit cum eo: qui crevit, et moratus est in solitudine, factusque est juvenis sagittarius.
21 Habitavitque in deserto Pharan, et accepit illi mater sua uxorem de terra Ægypti.

22 Eodem tempore dixit Abimelech, et Phicol princeps exercitus ejus, ad Abraham: Deus tecum est in universis quæ agis.
23 Jura ergo per Deum, ne noceas mihi, et posteris meis, stirpique meæ: sed juxta misericordiam, quam feci tibi, facies mihi, et terræ in qua versatus es advena.
24 Dixitque Abraham: Ego jurabo.
25 Et increpavit Abimelech propter puteum aquæ quem vi abstulerunt servi ejus.
26 Responditque Abimelech: Nescivi quis fecerit hanc rem: sed et tu non indicasti mihi, et ego non audivi præter hodie.
27 Tulit itaque Abraham oves et boves, et dedit Abimelech: percusseruntque ambo fœdus.
28 Et statuit Abraham septem agnas gregis seorsum.
29 Cui dixit Abimelech: Quid sibi volunt septem agnæ istæ, quas stare fecisti seorsum?
30 At ille: Septem, inquit, agnas accipies de manu mea: ut sint mihi in testimonium, quoniam ego fodi puteum istum.
31 Idcirco vocatus est locus ille Bersabee: quia ibi uterque juravit.
32 Et inierunt fœdus pro puteo juramenti.
33 Surrexit autem Abimelech, et Phicol princeps exercitus ejus, reversique sunt in terram Palæstinorum. Abraham vero plantavit nemus in Bersabee, et invocavit ibi nomen Domini Dei æterni.
34 Et fuit colonus terræ Palæstinorum diebus multis.

1 καὶ κύριος ἐπεσκέψατο τὴν Σαρραν καθὰ εἶπεν καὶ ἐποίησεν κύριος τῇ Σαρρα καθὰ ἐλάλησεν
2 καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτεκεν Σαρρα τῷ Αβρααμ υἱὸν εἰς τὸ γῆρας εἰς τὸν καιρόν καθὰ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ κύριος
3 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Αβρααμ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ τοῦ γενομένου αὐτῷ ὃν ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ Σαρρα Ισαακ
4 περιέτεμεν δὲ Αβρααμ τὸν Ισαακ τῇ ὀγδόῃ ἡμέρᾳ καθὰ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ὁ θεός
5 Αβρααμ δὲ ἦν ἑκατὸν ἐτῶν ἡνίκα ἐγένετο αὐτῷ Ισαακ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ
6 εἶπεν δὲ Σαρρα γέλωτά μοι ἐποίησεν κύριος ὃς γὰρ ἂν ἀκούσῃ συγχαρεῖταί μοι
7 καὶ εἶπεν τίς ἀναγγελεῖ τῷ Αβρααμ ὅτι θηλάζει παιδίον Σαρρα ὅτι ἔτεκον υἱὸν ἐν τῷ γήρει μου

8 καὶ ηὐξήθη τὸ παιδίον καὶ ἀπεγαλακτίσθη καὶ ἐποίησεν Αβρααμ δοχὴν μεγάλην ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἀπεγαλακτίσθη Ισαακ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ
9 ἰδοῦσα δὲ Σαρρα τὸν υἱὸν Αγαρ τῆς Αἰγυπτίας ὃς ἐγένετο τῷ Αβρααμ παίζοντα μετὰ Ισαακ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς
10 καὶ εἶπεν τῷ Αβρααμ ἔκβαλε τὴν παιδίσκην ταύτην καὶ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς οὐ γὰρ κληρονομήσει ὁ υἱὸς τῆς παιδίσκης ταύτης μετὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ μου Ισαακ
11 σκληρὸν δὲ ἐφάνη τὸ ῥῆμα σφόδρα ἐναντίον Αβρααμ περὶ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ
12 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ θεὸς τῷ Αβρααμ μὴ σκληρὸν ἔστω τὸ ῥῆμα ἐναντίον σου περὶ τοῦ παιδίου καὶ περὶ τῆς παιδίσκης πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃ σοι Σαρρα ἄκουε τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῆς ὅτι ἐν Ισαακ κληθήσεταί σοι σπέρμα
13 καὶ τὸν υἱὸν δὲ τῆς παιδίσκης ταύτης εἰς ἔθνος μέγα ποιήσω αὐτόν ὅτι σπέρμα σόν ἐστιν
14 ἀνέστη δὲ Αβρααμ τὸ πρωὶ καὶ ἔλαβεν ἄρτους καὶ ἀσκὸν ὕδατος καὶ ἔδωκεν Αγαρ καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸν ὦμον καὶ τὸ παιδίον καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτήν ἀπελθοῦσα δὲ ἐπλανᾶτο τὴν ἔρημον κατὰ τὸ φρέαρ τοῦ ὅρκου
15 ἐξέλιπεν δὲ τὸ ὕδωρ ἐκ τοῦ ἀσκοῦ καὶ ἔρριψεν τὸ παιδίον ὑποκάτω μιᾶς ἐλάτης
16 ἀπελθοῦσα δὲ ἐκάθητο ἀπέναντι αὐτοῦ μακρόθεν ὡσεὶ τόξου βολήν εἶπεν γάρ οὐ μὴ ἴδω τὸν θάνατον τοῦ παιδίου μου καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἀπέναντι αὐτοῦ ἀναβοῆσαν δὲ τὸ παιδίον ἔκλαυσεν
17 εἰσήκουσεν δὲ ὁ θεὸς τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ παιδίου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου οὗ ἦν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ τὴν Αγαρ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ τί ἐστιν Αγαρ μὴ φοβοῦ ἐπακήκοεν γὰρ ὁ θεὸς τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ παιδίου σου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου οὗ ἐστιν
18 ἀνάστηθι λαβὲ τὸ παιδίον καὶ κράτησον τῇ χειρί σου αὐτό εἰς γὰρ ἔθνος μέγα ποιήσω αὐτόν
19 καὶ ἀνέῳξεν ὁ θεὸς τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῆς καὶ εἶδεν φρέαρ ὕδατος ζῶντος καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ ἔπλησεν τὸν ἀσκὸν ὕδατος καὶ ἐπότισεν τὸ παιδίον
20 καὶ ἦν ὁ θεὸς μετὰ τοῦ παιδίου καὶ ηὐξήθη καὶ κατῴκησεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐγένετο δὲ τοξότης
21 καὶ κατῴκησεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τῇ Φαραν καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτῷ ἡ μήτηρ γυναῖκα ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου

22 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ καὶ εἶπεν Αβιμελεχ καὶ Οχοζαθ ὁ νυμφαγωγὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ Φικολ ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ πρὸς Αβρααμ λέγων ὁ θεὸς μετὰ σοῦ ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐὰν ποιῇς
23 νῦν οὖν ὄμοσόν μοι τὸν θεὸν μὴ ἀδικήσειν με μηδὲ τὸ σπέρμα μου μηδὲ τὸ ὄνομά μου ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὴν δικαιοσύνην ἣν ἐποίησα μετὰ σοῦ ποιήσεις με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ τῇ γῇ ᾗ σὺ παρῴκησας ἐν αὐτῇ
24 καὶ εἶπεν Αβρααμ ἐγὼ ὀμοῦμαι
25 καὶ ἤλεγξεν Αβρααμ τὸν Αβιμελεχ περὶ τῶν φρεάτων τοῦ ὕδατος ὧν ἀφείλαντο οἱ παῖδες τοῦ Αβιμελεχ
26 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Αβιμελεχ οὐκ ἔγνων τίς ἐποίησεν τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο οὐδὲ σύ μοι ἀπήγγειλας οὐδὲ ἐγὼ ἤκουσα ἀλ{L'} ἢ σήμερον
27 καὶ ἔλαβεν Αβρααμ πρόβατα καὶ μόσχους καὶ ἔδωκεν τῷ Αβιμελεχ καὶ διέθεντο ἀμφότεροι διαθήκην
28 καὶ ἔστησεν Αβρααμ ἑπτὰ ἀμνάδας προβάτων μόνας
29 καὶ εἶπεν Αβιμελεχ τῷ Αβρααμ τί εἰσιν αἱ ἑπτὰ ἀμνάδες τῶν προβάτων τούτων ἃς ἔστησας μόνας
30 καὶ εἶπεν Αβρααμ ὅτι τὰς ἑπτὰ ἀμνάδας ταύτας λήμψῃ πα{R'} ἐμοῦ ἵνα ὦσίν μοι εἰς μαρτύριον ὅτι ἐγὼ ὤρυξα τὸ φρέαρ τοῦτο
31 διὰ τοῦτο ἐπωνόμασεν τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου Φρέαρ ὁρκισμοῦ ὅτι ἐκεῖ ὤμοσαν ἀμφότεροι
32 καὶ διέθεντο διαθήκην ἐν τῷ φρέατι τοῦ ὅρκου ἀνέστη δὲ Αβιμελεχ καὶ Οχοζαθ ὁ νυμφαγωγὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ Φικολ ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν Φυλιστιιμ
33 καὶ ἐφύτευσεν Αβρααμ ἄρουραν ἐπὶ τῷ φρέατι τοῦ ὅρκου καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο ἐκεῖ τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου θεὸς αἰώνιος
34 παρῴκησεν δὲ Αβρααμ ἐν τῇ γῇ τῶν Φυλιστιιμ ἡμέρας πολλάς
