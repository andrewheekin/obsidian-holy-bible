# Book of Genesis 47 (RSVCE)

1 So Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan; they are now in the land of Goshen.”
2 And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh.
3 Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were.”
4 They said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land; for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan; and now, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.”
5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.
6 The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen; and if you know any able men among them, put them in charge of my cattle.”
7 Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
8 And Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many are the days of the years of your life?”
9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojourning are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning.”
10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
11 Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Ramʹeses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
12 And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household with food, according to the number of their dependents.
### The Famine in Egypt
13 Now there was no food in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine.
14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
15 And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us food; why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone.”
16 And Joseph answered, “Give your cattle, and I will give you food in exchange for your cattle, if your money is gone.”
17 So they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the asses: and he supplied them with food in exchange for all their cattle that year.
18 And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord’s; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands.
19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we with our land will be slaves to Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.”
20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for all the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe upon them. The land became Pharaoh’s;
21 and as for the people, he made slaves of them from one end of Egypt to the other.
22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh, and lived on the allowance which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.
23 Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.
24 And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones.”
25 And they said, “You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be slaves to Pharaoh.”
26 So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh’s.
### The Last Days of Jacob
27 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.
28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years.
29 And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh, and promise to deal loyally and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt,
30 but let me lie with my fathers; carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.” He answered, “I will do as you have said.”
31 And he said, “Swear to me”; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed.


# Liber Genesis 47 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Ingressus ergo Joseph nuntiavit Pharaoni, dicens: Pater meus et fratres, oves eorum et armenta, et cuncta quæ possident, venerunt de terra Chanaan: et ecce consistunt in terra Gessen.
2 Extremos quoque fratrum suorum quinque viros constituit coram rege:
3 quos ille interrogavit: Quid habetis operis? Responderunt: Pastores ovium sumus servi tui, et nos et patres nostri.
4 Ad peregrinandum in terra tua venimus: quoniam non est herba gregibus servorum tuorum, ingravescente fame in terra Chanaan: petimusque ut esse nos jubeas servos tuos in terra Gessen.
5 Dixit itaque rex ad Joseph: Pater tuus et fratres tui venerunt ad te.
6 Terra Ægypti in conspectu tuo est: in optimo loco fac eos habitare, et trade eis terram Gessen. Quod si nosti in eis esse viros industrios, constitue illos magistros pecorum meorum.
7 Post hæc introduxit Joseph patrem suum ad regem, et statuit eum coram eo: qui benedicens illi,
8 et interrogatus ab eo: Quot sunt dies annorum vitæ tuæ?
9 respondit: Dies peregrinationis meæ centum triginta annorum sunt, parvi et mali, et non pervenerunt usque ad dies patrum meorum quibus peregrinati sunt.
10 Et benedicto rege, egressus est foras.

11 Joseph vero patri et fratribus suis dedit possessionem in Ægypto in optimo terræ loco, Ramesses, ut præceperat Pharao.
12 Et alebat eos, omnemque domum patris sui, præbens cibaria singulis.
13 In toto enim orbe panis deerat, et oppresserat fames terram, maxime Ægypti et Chanaan.
14 E quibus omnem pecuniam congregavit pro venditione frumenti, et intulit eam in ærarium regis.
15 Cumque defecisset emptoribus pretium, venit cuncta Ægyptus ad Joseph, dicens: Da nobis panes: quare morimur coram te, deficiente pecunia?
16 Quibus ille respondit: Adducite pecora vestra, et dabo vobis pro eis cibos, si pretium non habetis.
17 Quæ cum adduxissent, dedit eis alimenta pro equis, et ovibus, et bobus, et asinis: sustentavitque eos illo anno pro commutatione pecorum.
18 Venerunt quoque anno secundo, et dixerunt ei: Non celabimus dominum nostrum quod deficiente pecunia, pecora simul defecerunt: nec clam te est, quod absque corporibus et terra nihil habeamus.
19 Cur ergo moriemur te vidente? et nos et terra nostra tui erimus: eme nos in servitutem regiam, et præbe semina, ne pereunte cultore redigatur terra in solitudinem.
20 Emit igitur Joseph omnem terram Ægypti, vendentibus singulis possessiones suas præ magnitudine famis. Subjecitque eam Pharaoni,
21 et cunctos populos ejus a novissimis terminis Ægypti usque ad extremos fines ejus,
22 præter terram sacerdotum, quæ a rege tradita fuerat eis: quibus et statuta cibaria ex horreis publicis præbebantur, et idcirco non sunt compulsi vendere possessiones suas.

23 Dixit ergo Joseph ad populos: En ut cernitis, et vos et terram vestram Pharao possidet: accipite semina, et serite agros,
24 ut fruges habere possitis. Quintam partem regi dabitis: quatuor reliquas permitto vobis in sementem, et in cibum familiis et liberis vestris.
25 Qui responderunt: Salus nostra in manu tua est: respiciat nos tantum dominus noster, et læti serviemus regi.
26 Ex eo tempore usque in præsentem diem, in universa terra Ægypti regibus quinta pars solvitur, et factum est quasi in legem, absque terra sacerdotali, quæ libera ab hac conditione fuit.

27 Habitavit ergo Israël in Ægypto, id est, in terra Gessen, et possedit eam: auctusque est, et multiplicatus nimis.
28 Et vixit in ea decem et septem annis: factique sunt omnes dies vitæ illius, centum quadraginta septem annorum.
29 Cumque appropinquare cerneret diem mortis suæ, vocavit filium suum Joseph, et dixit ad eum: Si inveni gratiam in conspectu tuo, pone manum tuam sub femore meo: et facies mihi misericordiam et veritatem, ut non sepelias me in Ægypto:
30 sed dormiam cum patribus meis, et auferas me de terra hac, condasque in sepulchro majorum meorum. Cui respondit Joseph: Ego faciam quod jussisti.
31 Et ille: Jura ergo, inquit, mihi. Quo jurante, adoravit Israël Deum, conversus ad lectuli caput.


# Γένεσις 47 (Septuagint)

1 ἐλθὼν δὲ Ιωσηφ ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ Φαραω λέγων ὁ πατήρ μου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου καὶ τὰ κτήνη καὶ οἱ βόες αὐτῶν καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτῶν ἦλθον ἐκ γῆς Χανααν καὶ ἰδού εἰσιν ἐν γῇ Γεσεμ
2 ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ παρέλαβεν πέντε ἄνδρας καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτοὺς ἐναντίον Φαραω
3 καὶ εἶπεν Φαραω τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς Ιωσηφ τί τὸ ἔργον ὑμῶν οἱ δὲ εἶπαν τῷ Φαραω ποιμένες προβάτων οἱ παῖδές σου καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν
4 εἶπαν δὲ τῷ Φαραω παροικεῖν ἐν τῇ γῇ ἥκαμεν οὐ γάρ ἐστιν νομὴ τοῖς κτήνεσιν τῶν παίδων σου ἐνίσχυσεν γὰρ ὁ λιμὸς ἐν γῇ Χανααν νῦν οὖν κατοικήσομεν οἱ παῖδές σου ἐν γῇ Γεσεμ
5 εἶπεν δὲ Φαραω τῷ Ιωσφη κατοικείτωσαν ἐν γῇ Γεσεμ εἰ δὲ ἐπίστῃ ὅτι εἰσὶν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἄνδρες δυνατοί κατάστησον αὐτοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν ἐμῶν κτηνῶν ἦλθον δὲ εἰς Αἴγυπτον πρὸς Ιωσηφ Ιακωβ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἤκουσεν Φαραω βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου καὶ εἶπεν Φαραω πρὸς Ιωσηφ λέγων ὁ πατήρ σου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου ἥκασι πρὸς σέ
6 ἰδοὺ ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου ἐναντίον σού ἐστιν ἐν τῇ βελτίστῃ γῇ κατοίκισον τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου
7 εἰσήγαγεν δὲ Ιωσηφ Ιακωβ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὸν ἐναντίον Φαραω καὶ εὐλόγησεν Ιακωβ τὸν Φαραω
8 εἶπεν δὲ Φαραω τῷ Ιακωβ πόσα ἔτη ἡμερῶν τῆς ζωῆς σου
9 καὶ εἶπεν Ιακωβ τῷ Φαραω αἱ ἡμέραι τῶν ἐτῶν τῆς ζωῆς μου ἃς παροικῶ ἑκατὸν τριάκοντα ἔτη μικραὶ καὶ πονηραὶ γεγόνασιν αἱ ἡμέραι τῶν ἐτῶν τῆς ζωῆς μου οὐκ ἀφίκοντο εἰς τὰς ἡμέρας τῶν ἐτῶν τῆς ζωῆς τῶν πατέρων μου ἃς ἡμέρας παρῴκησαν
10 καὶ εὐλογήσας Ιακωβ τὸν Φαραω ἐξῆλθεν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ

11 καὶ κατῴκισεν Ιωσηφ τὸν πατέρα καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς κατάσχεσιν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου ἐν τῇ βελτίστῃ γῇ ἐν γῇ Ραμεσση καθὰ προσέταξεν Φαραω
12 καὶ ἐσιτομέτρει Ιωσηφ τῷ πατρὶ καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ παντὶ τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ σῖτον κατὰ σῶμα
13 σῖτος δὲ οὐκ ἦν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ ἐνίσχυσεν γὰρ ὁ λιμὸς σφόδρα ἐξέλιπεν δὲ ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἡ γῆ Χανααν ἀπὸ τοῦ λιμοῦ
14 συνήγαγεν δὲ Ιωσηφ πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐν γῇ Χανααν τοῦ σίτου οὗ ἠγόραζον καὶ ἐσιτομέτρει αὐτοῖς καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν Ιωσηφ πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φαραω
15 καὶ ἐξέλιπεν πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐκ γῆς Χανααν ἦλθον δὲ πάντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι πρὸς Ιωσηφ λέγοντες δὸς ἡμῖν ἄρτους καὶ ἵνα τί ἀποθνῄσκομεν ἐναντίον σου ἐκλέλοιπεν γὰρ τὸ ἀργύριον ἡμῶν
16 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ φέρετε τὰ κτήνη ὑμῶν καὶ δώσω ὑμῖν ἄρτους ἀντὶ τῶν κτηνῶν ὑμῶν εἰ ἐκλέλοιπεν τὸ ἀργύριον
17 ἤγαγον δὲ τὰ κτήνη πρὸς Ιωσηφ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ ἄρτους ἀντὶ τῶν ἵππων καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν προβάτων καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν βοῶν καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν ὄνων καὶ ἐξέθρεψεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἄρτοις ἀντὶ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ
18 ἐξῆλθεν δὲ τὸ ἔτος ἐκεῖνο καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ δευτέρῳ καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ μήποτε ἐκτριβῶμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν εἰ γὰρ ἐκλέλοιπεν τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα καὶ τὰ κτήνη πρὸς σὲ τὸν κύριον καὶ οὐχ ὑπολείπεται ἡμῖν ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν ἀλ{L'} ἢ τὸ ἴδιον σῶμα καὶ ἡ γῆ ἡμῶν
19 ἵνα οὖν μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν ἐναντίον σου καὶ ἡ γῆ ἐρημωθῇ κτῆσαι ἡμᾶς καὶ τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν ἀντὶ ἄρτων καὶ ἐσόμεθα ἡμεῖς καὶ ἡ γῆ ἡμῶν παῖδες Φαραω δὸς σπέρμα ἵνα σπείρωμεν καὶ ζῶμεν καὶ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν καὶ ἡ γῆ οὐκ ἐρημωθήσεται
20 καὶ ἐκτήσατο Ιωσηφ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων τῷ Φαραω ἀπέδοντο γὰρ οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν τῷ Φαραω ἐπεκράτησεν γὰρ αὐτῶν ὁ λιμός καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ γῆ Φαραω
21 καὶ τὸν λαὸν κατεδουλώσατο αὐτῷ εἰς παῖδας ἀ{P'} ἄκρων ὁρίων Αἰγύπτου ἕως τῶν ἄκρων
22 χωρὶς τῆς γῆς τῶν ἱερέων μόνον οὐκ ἐκτήσατο ταύτην Ιωσηφ ἐν δόσει γὰρ ἔδωκεν δόμα τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν Φαραω καὶ ἤσθιον τὴν δόσιν ἣν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς Φαραω διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀπέδοντο τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν

23 εἶπεν δὲ Ιωσηφ πᾶσι τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις ἰδοὺ κέκτημαι ὑμᾶς καὶ τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν σήμερον τῷ Φαραω λάβετε ἑαυτοῖς σπέρμα καὶ σπείρατε τὴν γῆν
24 καὶ ἔσται τὰ γενήματα αὐτῆς δώσετε τὸ πέμπτον μέρος τῷ Φαραω τὰ δὲ τέσσαρα μέρη ἔσται ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς εἰς σπέρμα τῇ γῇ καὶ εἰς βρῶσιν ὑμῖν καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις ὑμῶν
25 καὶ εἶπαν σέσωκας ἡμᾶς εὕρομεν χάριν ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν καὶ ἐσόμεθα παῖδες Φαραω
26 καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ εἰς πρόσταγμα ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης ἐπὶ γῆν Αἰγύπτου τῷ Φαραω ἀποπεμπτοῦν χωρὶς τῆς γῆς τῶν ἱερέων μόνον οὐκ ἦν τῷ Φαραω

27 κατῴκησεν δὲ Ισραηλ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς Γεσεμ καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς καὶ ηὐξήθησαν καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν σφόδρα
28 ἐπέζησεν δὲ Ιακωβ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ δέκα ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἐγένοντο δὲ αἱ ἡμέραι Ιακωβ ἐνιαυτῶν τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ ἑκατὸν τεσσαράκοντα ἑπτὰ ἔτη
29 ἤγγισαν δὲ αἱ ἡμέραι Ισραηλ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ Ιωσηφ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ εἰ εὕρηκα χάριν ἐναντίον σου ὑπόθες τὴν χεῖρά σου ὑπὸ τὸν μηρόν μου καὶ ποιήσεις ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ ἐλεημοσύνην καὶ ἀλήθειαν τοῦ μή με θάψαι ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ
30 ἀλλὰ κοιμηθήσομαι μετὰ τῶν πατέρων μου καὶ ἀρεῖς με ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ θάψεις με ἐν τῷ τάφῳ αὐτῶν ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ἐγὼ ποιήσω κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου
31 εἶπεν δέ ὄμοσόν μοι καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ καὶ προσεκύνησεν Ισραηλ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ
