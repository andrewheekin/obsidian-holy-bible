# Book of Genesis 27 (RSVCE)

### Isaac Blesses Jacob
1 When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son, and said to him, “My son”; and he answered, “Here I am.”
2 He said, “Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.
3 Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me,
4 and prepare for me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat; that I may bless you before I die.”
5 Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,
6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I heard your father speak to your brother Esau,
7 ‘Bring me game, and prepare for me savory food, that I may eat it, and bless you before theLordbefore I die.’
8 Now therefore, my son, obey my word as I command you.
9 Go to the flock, and fetch me two good kids, that I may prepare from them savory food for your father, such as he loves;
10 and you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.”
11 But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
12 Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him, and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.”
13 His mother said to him, “Upon me be your curse, my son; only obey my word, and go, fetch them to me.”
14 So he went and took them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savory food, such as his father loved.
15 Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son;
16 and the skins of the kids she put upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck;
17 and she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
18 So he went in to his father, and said, “My father”; and he said, “Here I am; who are you, my son?”
19 Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your first-born. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that you may bless me.”
20 But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “Because theLordyour God granted me success.”
21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.”
22 So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”
23 And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.
24 He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He answered, “I am.”
25 Then he said, “Bring it to me, that I may eat of my son’s game and bless you.” So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
26 Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near and kiss me, my son.”
27 So he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, “See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which theLordhas blessed!
28 May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine.
29 Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be every one who curses you, and blessed be every one who blesses you!”
### Esau’s Lost Blessing
30 As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
31 He also prepared savory food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s game, that you may bless me.”
32 His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your son, your first-born, Esau.”
33 Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him?—yes, and he shall be blessed.”
34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!”
35 But he said, “Your brother came with guile, and he has taken away your blessing.”
36 Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright; and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.” Then he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”
37 Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?”
38 Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
39 Then Isaac his father answered him: “Behold, away fromythe fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away fromzthe dew of heaven on high.
40 By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but when you break loose you shall break his yoke from your neck.”
### Jacob Escapes Esau’s Fury
41 Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
42 But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah; so she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself by planning to kill you.
43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran,
44 and stay with him a while, until your brother’s fury turns away;
45 until your brother’s anger turns away, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send, and fetch you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?”
46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women such as these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?”


# Liber Genesis 27 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Senuit autem Isaac, et caligaverunt oculi ejus, et videre non poterat: vocavitque Esau filium suum majorem, et dixit ei: Fili mi? Qui respondit: Adsum.
2 Cui pater: Vides, inquit, quod senuerim, et ignorem diem mortis meæ.
3 Sume arma tua, pharetram, et arcum, et egredere foras: cumque venatu aliquid apprehenderis,
4 fac mihi inde pulmentum sicut velle me nosti, et affer ut comedam: et benedicat tibi anima mea antequam moriar.

5 Quod cum audisset Rebecca, et ille abiisset in agrum ut jussionem patris impleret,
6 dixit filio suo Jacob: Audivi patrem tuum loquentem cum Esau fratre tuo, et dicentem ei:
7 Affer mihi de venatione tua, et fac cibos ut comedam, et benedicam tibi coram Domino antequam moriar.
8 Nunc ergo, fili mi, acquiesce consiliis meis:
9 et pergens ad gregem, affer mihi duos hædos optimos, ut faciam ex eis escas patri tuo, quibus libenter vescitur:
10 quas cum intuleris, et comederit, benedicat tibi priusquam moriatur.
11 Cui ille respondit: Nosti quod Esau frater meus homo pilosus sit, et ego lenis:
12 si attrectaverit me pater meus, et senserit, timeo ne putet me sibi voluisse illudere, et inducam super me maledictionem pro benedictione.
13 Ad quem mater: In me sit, ait, ista maledictio, fili mi: tantum audi vocem meam, et pergens, affer quæ dixi.
14 Abiit, et attulit, deditque matri. Paravit illa cibos, sicut velle noverat patrem illius.
15 Et vestibus Esau valde bonis, quas apud se habebat domi, induit eum:
16 pelliculasque hædorum circumdedit manibus, et colli nuda protexit:
17 deditque pulmentum, et panes, quos coxerat, tradidit.

18 Quibus illatis, dixit: Pater mi? At ille respondit: Audio. Quis es tu, fili mi?
19 Dixitque Jacob: Ego sum primogenitus tuus Esau: feci sicut præcepisti mihi: surge, sede, et comede de venatione mea, ut benedicat mihi anima tua.
20 Rursumque Isaac ad filium suum: Quomodo, inquit, tam cito invenire potuisti, fili mi? Qui respondit: Voluntas Dei fuit ut cito occurreret mihi quod volebam.
21 Dixitque Isaac: Accede huc, ut tangam te, fili mi, et probem utrum tu sis filius meus Esau, an non.
22 Accessit ille ad patrem, et palpato eo, dixit Isaac: Vox quidem, vox Jacob est: sed manus, manus sunt Esau.
23 Et non cognovit eum, quia pilosæ manus similitudinem majoris expresserant. Benedicens ergo illi,
24 ait: Tu es filius meus Esau? Respondit: Ego sum.
25 At ille: Affer mihi, inquit, cibos de venatione tua, fili mi, ut benedicat tibi anima mea. Quos cum oblatos comedisset, obtulit ei etiam vinum. Quo hausto,

26 dixit ad eum: Accede ad me, et da mihi osculum, fili mi.
27 Accessit, et osculatus est eum. Statimque ut sensit vestimentorum illius fragrantiam, benedicens illi, ait:Ecce odor filii meisicut odor agri pleni,cui benedixit Dominus.
28 Det tibi Deus de rore cæliet de pinguedine terræabundantiam frumenti et vini.
29 Et serviant tibi populi,et adorent te tribus:esto dominus fratrum tuorum,et incurventur ante te filii matris tuæ:qui maledixerit tibi, sit ille maledictus,et qui benedixerit tibi, benedictionibus repleatur.
30 Vix Isaac sermonem impleverat, et egresso Jacob foras, venit Esau,
31 coctosque de venatione cibos intulit patri, dicens: Surge, pater mi, et comede de venatione filii tui, ut benedicat mihi anima tua.
32 Dixitque illi Isaac: Quis enim es tu? Qui respondit: Ego sum filius tuus primogenitus Esau.
33 Expavit Isaac stupore vehementi: et ultra quam credi potest admirans, ait: Quis igitur ille est qui dudum captam venationem attulit mihi, et comedi ex omnibus priusquam tu venires; benedixique ei, et erit benedictus?

34 Auditis Esau sermonibus patris, irrugiit clamore magno: et consternatus, ait: Benedic etiam et mihi, pater mi.
35 Qui ait: Venit germanus tuus fraudulenter, et accepit benedictionem tuam.
36 At ille subjunxit: Juste vocatum est nomen ejus Jacob: supplantavit enim me en altera vice: primogenita mea ante tulit, et nunc secundo surripuit benedictionem meam. Rursumque ad patrem: Numquid non reservasti, ait, et mihi benedictionem?
37 Respondit Isaac: Dominum tuum illum constitui, et omnes fratres ejus servituti illius subjugavi; frumento et vino stabilivi eum: et tibi post hæc, fili mi, ultra quid faciam?
38 Cui Esau: Num unam, inquit, tantum benedictionem habes, pater? mihi quoque obsecro ut benedicas. Cumque ejulatu magno fleret,
39 motus Isaac, dixit ad eum:In pinguedine terræ,et in rore cæli desuper,
40 erit benedictio tua.Vives in gladio, et fratri tuo servies:tempusque veniet, cum excutias et solvas jugum ejus de cervicibus tuis.

41 Oderat ergo semper Esau Jacob pro benedictione qua benedixerat ei pater: dixitque in corde suo: Venient dies luctus patris mei, et occidam Jacob fratrem meum.
42 Nuntiata sunt hæc Rebeccæ: quæ mittens et vocans Jacob filium suum, dixit ad eum: Ecce Esau frater tuus minatur ut occidat te.
43 Nunc ergo, fili mi, audi vocem meam, et consurgens fuge ad Laban fratrem meum in Haran:
44 habitabisque cum eo dies paucos, donec requiescat furor fratris tui,
45 et cesset indignatio ejus, obliviscaturque eorum quæ fecisti in eum: postea mittam, et adducam te inde huc: cur utroque orbabor filio in uno die?
46 Dixitque Rebecca ad Isaac: Tædet me vitæ meæ propter filias Heth: si acceperit Jacob uxorem de stirpe hujus terræ, nolo vivere.

1 ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὸ γηρᾶσαι Ισαακ καὶ ἠμβλύνθησαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ τοῦ ὁρᾶν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ησαυ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν πρεσβύτερον καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ υἱέ μου καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγώ

5 Ρεβεκκα δὲ ἤκουσεν λαλοῦντος Ισαακ πρὸς Ησαυ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπορεύθη δὲ Ησαυ εἰς τὸ πεδίον θηρεῦσαι θήραν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ
6 Ρεβεκκα δὲ εἶπεν πρὸς Ιακωβ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν ἐλάσσω ἰδὲ ἐγὼ ἤκουσα τοῦ πατρός σου λαλοῦντος πρὸς Ησαυ τὸν ἀδελφόν σου λέγοντος
7 ἔνεγκόν μοι θήραν καὶ ποίησόν μοι ἐδέσματα καὶ φαγὼν εὐλογήσω σε ἐναντίον κυρίου πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν με
8 νῦν οὖν υἱέ ἄκουσόν μου καθὰ ἐγώ σοι ἐντέλλομαι
9 καὶ πορευθεὶς εἰς τὰ πρόβατα λαβέ μοι ἐκεῖθεν δύο ἐρίφους ἁπαλοὺς καὶ καλούς καὶ ποιήσω αὐτοὺς ἐδέσματα τῷ πατρί σου ὡς φιλεῖ
10 καὶ εἰσοίσεις τῷ πατρί σου καὶ φάγεται ὅπως εὐλογήσῃ σε ὁ πατήρ σου πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτόν
11 εἶπεν δὲ Ιακωβ πρὸς Ρεβεκκαν τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ ἔστιν Ησαυ ὁ ἀδελφός μου ἀνὴρ δασύς ἐγὼ δὲ ἀνὴρ λεῖος
12 μήποτε ψηλαφήσῃ με ὁ πατήρ μου καὶ ἔσομαι ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ὡς καταφρονῶν καὶ ἐπάξω ἐ{P'} ἐμαυτὸν κατάραν καὶ οὐκ εὐλογίαν
13 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ἡ μήτηρ ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ ἡ κατάρα σου τέκνον μόνον ὑπάκουσον τῆς φωνῆς μου καὶ πορευθεὶς ἔνεγκέ μοι
14 πορευθεὶς δὲ ἔλαβεν καὶ ἤνεγκεν τῇ μητρί καὶ ἐποίησεν ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ ἐδέσματα καθὰ ἐφίλει ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ λαβοῦσα Ρεβεκκα τὴν στολὴν Ησαυ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου τὴν καλήν ἣ ἦν πα{R'} αὐτῇ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ἐνέδυσεν Ιακωβ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν νεώτερον
16 καὶ τὰ δέρματα τῶν ἐρίφων περιέθηκεν ἐπὶ τοὺς βραχίονας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ γυμνὰ τοῦ τραχήλου αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ ἔδωκεν τὰ ἐδέσματα καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους οὓς ἐποίησεν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας Ιακωβ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς

18 καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ εἶπεν δέ πάτερ ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγώ τίς εἶ σύ τέκνον
19 καὶ εἶπεν Ιακωβ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ ἐγὼ Ησαυ ὁ πρωτότοκός σου ἐποίησα καθὰ ἐλάλησάς μοι ἀναστὰς κάθισον καὶ φάγε τῆς θήρας μου ὅπως εὐλογήσῃ με ἡ ψυχή σου
20 εἶπεν δὲ Ισαακ τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ τί τοῦτο ὃ ταχὺ εὗρες ὦ τέκνον ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ὃ παρέδωκεν κύριος ὁ θεός σου ἐναντίον μου
21 εἶπεν δὲ Ισαακ τῷ Ιακωβ ἔγγισόν μοι καὶ ψηλαφήσω σε τέκνον εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ υἱός μου Ησαυ ἢ οὔ
22 ἤγγισεν δὲ Ιακωβ πρὸς Ισαακ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐψηλάφησεν αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν ἡ μὲν φωνὴ φωνὴ Ιακωβ αἱ δὲ χεῖρες χεῖρες Ησαυ
23 καὶ οὐκ ἐπέγνω αὐτόν ἦσαν γὰρ αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ ὡς αἱ χεῖρες Ησαυ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ δασεῖαι καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτόν
24 καὶ εἶπεν σὺ εἶ ὁ υἱός μου Ησαυ ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ἐγώ
25 καὶ εἶπεν προσάγαγέ μοι καὶ φάγομαι ἀπὸ τῆς θήρας σου τέκνον ἵνα εὐλογήσῃ σε ἡ ψυχή μου καὶ προσήγαγεν αὐτῷ καὶ ἔφαγεν καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν αὐτῷ οἶνον καὶ ἔπιεν

26 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ισαακ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἔγγισόν μοι καὶ φίλησόν με τέκνον
27 καὶ ἐγγίσας ἐφίλησεν αὐτόν καὶ ὠσφράνθη τὴν ὀσμὴν τῶν ἱματίων αὐτοῦ καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ὀσμὴ τοῦ υἱοῦ μου ὡς ὀσμὴ ἀγροῦ πλήρους ὃν ηὐλόγησεν κύριος
28 καὶ δῴη σοι ὁ θεὸς ἀπὸ τῆς δρόσου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς πιότητος τῆς γῆς καὶ πλῆθος σίτου καὶ οἴνου
29 καὶ δουλευσάτωσάν σοι ἔθνη καὶ προσκυνήσουσίν σοι ἄρχοντες καὶ γίνου κύριος τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου καὶ προσκυνήσουσίν σοι οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ πατρός σου ὁ καταρώμενός σε ἐπικατάρατος ὁ δὲ εὐλογῶν σε εὐλογημένος
30 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ παύσασθαι Ισαακ εὐλογοῦντα Ιακωβ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξῆλθεν Ιακωβ ἀπὸ προσώπου Ισαακ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ Ησαυ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἦλθεν ἀπὸ τῆς θήρας
31 καὶ ἐποίησεν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐδέσματα καὶ προσήνεγκεν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν τῷ πατρί ἀναστήτω ὁ πατήρ μου καὶ φαγέτω τῆς θήρας τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ ὅπως εὐλογήσῃ με ἡ ψυχή σου
32 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ισαακ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ τίς εἶ σύ ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ υἱός σου ὁ πρωτότοκος Ησαυ
33 ἐξέστη δὲ Ισαακ ἔκστασιν μεγάλην σφόδρα καὶ εἶπεν τίς οὖν ὁ θηρεύσας μοι θήραν καὶ εἰσενέγκας μοι καὶ ἔφαγον ἀπὸ πάντων πρὸ τοῦ σε ἐλθεῖν καὶ ηὐλόγησα αὐτόν καὶ εὐλογημένος ἔστω

34 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἤκουσεν Ησαυ τὰ ῥήματα Ισαακ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἀνεβόησεν φωνὴν μεγάλην καὶ πικρὰν σφόδρα καὶ εἶπεν εὐλόγησον δὴ κἀμέ πάτερ
35 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ἐλθὼν ὁ ἀδελφός σου μετὰ δόλου ἔλαβεν τὴν εὐλογίαν σου
36 καὶ εἶπεν δικαίως ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ιακωβ ἐπτέρνικεν γάρ με ἤδη δεύτερον τοῦτο τά τε πρωτοτόκιά μου εἴληφεν καὶ νῦν εἴληφεν τὴν εὐλογίαν μου καὶ εἶπεν Ησαυ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ οὐχ ὑπελίπω μοι εὐλογίαν πάτερ
37 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ισαακ εἶπεν τῷ Ησαυ εἰ κύριον αὐτὸν ἐποίησά σου καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐποίησα αὐτοῦ οἰκέτας σίτῳ καὶ οἴνῳ ἐστήρισα αὐτόν σοὶ δὲ τί ποιήσω τέκνον
38 εἶπεν δὲ Ησαυ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ μὴ εὐλογία μία σοί ἐστιν πάτερ εὐλόγησον δὴ κἀμέ πάτερ κατανυχθέντος δὲ Ισαακ ἀνεβόησεν φωνὴν Ησαυ καὶ ἔκλαυσεν
39 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ισαακ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἰδοὺ ἀπὸ τῆς πιότητος τῆς γῆς ἔσται ἡ κατοίκησίς σου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δρόσου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἄνωθεν
40 καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ μαχαίρῃ σου ζήσῃ καὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου δουλεύσεις ἔσται δὲ ἡνίκα ἐὰν καθέλῃς καὶ ἐκλύσεις τὸν ζυγὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ τραχήλου σου

41 καὶ ἐνεκότει Ησαυ τῷ Ιακωβ περὶ τῆς εὐλογίας ἧς εὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ εἶπεν δὲ Ησαυ ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ ἐγγισάτωσαν αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ πένθους τοῦ πατρός μου ἵνα ἀποκτείνω Ιακωβ τὸν ἀδελφόν μου
42 ἀπηγγέλη δὲ Ρεβεκκα τὰ ῥήματα Ησαυ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου καὶ πέμψασα ἐκάλεσεν Ιακωβ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν νεώτερον καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἰδοὺ Ησαυ ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἀπειλεῖ σοι τοῦ ἀποκτεῖναί σε
43 νῦν οὖν τέκνον ἄκουσόν μου τῆς φωνῆς καὶ ἀναστὰς ἀπόδραθι εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν πρὸς Λαβαν τὸν ἀδελφόν μου εἰς Χαρραν
44 καὶ οἴκησον με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἡμέρας τινὰς ἕως τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι τὸν θυμὸν
45 καὶ τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου ἀπὸ σοῦ καὶ ἐπιλάθηται ἃ πεποίηκας αὐτῷ καὶ ἀποστείλασα μεταπέμψομαί σε ἐκεῖθεν μήποτε ἀτεκνωθῶ ἀπὸ τῶν δύο ὑμῶν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ
46 εἶπεν δὲ Ρεβεκκα πρὸς Ισαακ προσώχθικα τῇ ζωῇ μου διὰ τὰς θυγατέρας τῶν υἱῶν Χετ εἰ λήμψεται Ιακωβ γυναῖκα ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῆς γῆς ταύτης ἵνα τί μοι ζῆν
