# Book of Genesis 19 (RSVCE)

### The Depravity of Sodom
1 The two angels came to Sodom in the evening; and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and bowed himself with his face to the earth,
2 and said, “My lords, turn aside, I pray you, to your servant’s house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise up early and go on your way.” They said, “No; we will spend the night in the street.”
3 But he urged them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house;
5 and they called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.”
6 Lot went out of the door to the men, shut the door after him,
7 and said, “I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
8 Behold, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.”
9 But they said, “Stand back!” And they said, “This fellow came to sojourn, and he would play the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.” Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door.
10 But the men put forth their hands and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
11 And they struck with blindness the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves groping for the door.
### Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed
12 Then the men said to Lot, “Have you any one else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or any one you have in the city, bring them out of the place;
13 for we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before theLord, and theLordhas sent us to destroy it.”
14 So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, “Up, get out of this place; for theLordis about to destroy the city.” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
15 When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city.”
16 But he lingered; so the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, theLordbeing merciful to him, and they brought him forth and set him outside the city.
17 And when they had brought them forth, they said, “Flee for your life; do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley; flee to the hills, lest you be consumed.”
18 And Lot said to them, “Oh, no, my lords;
19 behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me, and I die.
20 Behold, yonder city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there—is it not a little one?—and my life will be saved!”
21 He said to him, “Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
22 Make haste, escape there; for I can do nothing till you arrive there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoʹar.
23 The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoʹar.
24 Then theLordrained on Sodom and Gomorʹrah brimstone and fire from theLordout of heaven;
25 and he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
26 But Lot’s wife behind him looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
27 And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before theLord;
28 and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorʹrah and toward all the land of the valley, and beheld, and lo, smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.
29 So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
### The Shameful Origin of Moab and Ammon
30 Now Lot went up out of Zoʹar, and dwelt in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to dwell in Zoʹar; so he dwelt in a cave with his two daughters.
31 And the first-born said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring through our father.”
33 So they made their father drink wine that night; and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
34 And on the next day, the first-born said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring through our father.”
35 So they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
36 Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
37 The first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.
38 The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites to this day.


# Liber Genesis 19 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Veneruntque duo angeli Sodomam vespere, et sedente Lot in foribus civitatis. Qui cum vidisset eos, surrexit, et ivit obviam eis: adoravitque pronus in terram,
2 et dixit: Obsecro, domini, declinate in domum pueri vestri, et manete ibi: lavate pedes vestros, et mane proficiscemini in viam vestram. Qui dixerunt: Minime, sed in platea manebimus.
3 Compulit illos oppido ut diverterent ad eum: ingressisque domum illius fecit convivium, et coxit azyma, et comederunt.
4 Prius autem quam irent cubitum, viri civitatis vallaverunt domum a puero usque ad senem, omnis populus simul.
5 Vocaveruntque Lot, et dixerunt ei: Ubi sunt viri qui introierunt ad te nocte? educ illos huc, ut cognoscamus eos.
6 Egressus ad eos Lot, post tergum occludens ostium, ait:
7 Nolite, quæso, fratres mei, nolite malum hoc facere.
8 Habeo duas filias, quæ necdum cognoverunt virum: educam eas ad vos, et abutimini eis sicut vobis placuerit, dummodo viris istis nihil mali faciatis, quia ingressi sunt sub umbra culminis mei.
9 At illi dixerunt: Recede illuc. Et rursus: Ingressus es, inquiunt, ut advena; numquid ut judices? te ergo ipsum magis quam hos affligemus. Vimque faciebant Lot vehementissime: jamque prope erat ut effringerent fores.
10 Et ecce miserunt manum viri, et introduxerunt ad se Lot, clauseruntque ostium:
11 et eos, qui foris erant, percusserunt cæcitate a minimo usque ad maximum, ita ut ostium invenire non possent.

12 Dixerunt autem ad Lot: Habes hic quempiam tuorum? generum, aut filios, aut filias, omnes, qui tui sunt, educ de urbe hac:
13 delebimus enim locum istum, eo quod increverit clamor eorum coram Domino, qui misit nos ut perdamus illos.
14 Egressus itaque Lot, locutus est ad generos suos qui accepturi erant filias ejus, et dixit: Surgite, egredimini de loco isto: quia delebit Dominus civitatem hanc. Et visus est eis quasi ludens loqui.
15 Cumque esset mane, cogebant eum angeli, dicentes: Surge, tolle uxorem tuam, et duas filias quas habes: ne et tu pariter pereas in scelere civitatis.
16 Dissimulante illo, apprehenderunt manum ejus, et manum uxoris, ac duarum filiarum ejus, eo quod parceret Dominus illi.
17 Eduxeruntque eum, et posuerunt extra civitatem: ibique locuti sunt ad eum, dicentes: Salva animam tuam: noli respicere post tergum, nec stes in omni circa regione: sed in monte salvum te fac, ne et tu simul pereas.

18 Dixitque Lot ad eos: Quæso, domine mi,
19 quia invenit servus tuus gratiam coram te, et magnificasti misericordiam tuam quam fecisti mecum, ut salvares animam meam, nec possum in monte salvari, ne forte apprehendat me malum, et moriar:
20 est civitas hæc juxta, ad quam possum fugere, parva, et salvabor in ea: numquid non modica est, et vivet anima mea?
21 Dixitque ad eum: Ecce etiam in hoc suscepi preces tuas, ut non subvertam urbem pro qua locutus es.
22 Festina, et salvare ibi: quia non potero facere quidquam donec ingrediaris illuc. Idcirco vocatum est nomen urbis illius Segor.
23 Sol egressus est super terram, et Lot ingressus est Segor.
24 Igitur Dominus pluit super Sodomam et Gomorrham sulphur et ignem a Domino de cælo:
25 et subvertit civitates has, et omnem circa regionem, universos habitatores urbium, et cuncta terræ virentia.
26 Respiciensque uxor ejus post se, versa est in statuam salis.
27 Abraham autem consurgens mane, ubi steterat prius cum Domino,
28 intuitus est Sodomam et Gomorrham, et universam terram regionis illius: viditque ascendentem favillam de terra quasi fornacis fumum.
29 Cum enim subverteret Deus civitates regionis illius, recordatus Abrahæ, liberavit Lot de subversione urbium in quibus habitaverat.

30 Ascenditque Lot de Segor, et mansit in monte, duæ quoque filiæ ejus cum eo (timuerat enim manere in Segor) et mansit in spelunca ipse, et duæ filiæ ejus cum eo.
31 Dixitque major ad minorem: Pater noster senex est, et nullus virorum remansit in terra, qui possit ingredi ad nos juxta morem universæ terræ.
32 Veni, inebriemus eum vino, dormiamusque cum eo, ut servare possimus ex patre nostro semen.
33 Dederunt itaque patri suo bibere vinum nocte illa. Et ingressa est major, dormivitque cum patre; at ille non sensit, nec quando accubuit filia, nec quando surrexit.
34 Altera quoque die dixit major ad minorem: Ecce dormivi heri cum patre meo, demus ei bibere vinum etiam hac nocte, et dormies cum eo, ut salvemus semen de patre nostro.
35 Dederunt etiam et illa nocte patri suo bibere vinum, ingressaque minor filia, dormivit cum eo: et ne tunc quidem sensit quando concubuerit, vel quando illa surrexerit.
36 Conceperunt ergo duæ filiæ Lot de patre suo.
37 Peperitque major filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Moab: ipse est pater Moabitarum usque in præsentem diem.
38 Minor quoque peperit filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Ammon, id est, Filius populi mei: ipse est pater Ammonitarum usque hodie.

1 ἦλθον δὲ οἱ δύο ἄγγελοι εἰς Σοδομα ἑσπέρας Λωτ δὲ ἐκάθητο παρὰ τὴν πύλην Σοδομων ἰδὼν δὲ Λωτ ἐξανέστη εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς καὶ προσεκύνησεν τῷ προσώπῳ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
2 καὶ εἶπεν ἰδού κύριοι ἐκκλίνατε εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ παιδὸς ὑμῶν καὶ καταλύσατε καὶ νίψασθε τοὺς πόδας ὑμῶν καὶ ὀρθρίσαντες ἀπελεύσεσθε εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ὑμῶν εἶπαν δέ οὐχί ἀλ{L'} ἐν τῇ πλατείᾳ καταλύσομεν
3 καὶ κατεβιάζετο αὐτούς καὶ ἐξέκλιναν πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς πότον καὶ ἀζύμους ἔπεψεν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἔφαγον
4 πρὸ τοῦ κοιμηθῆναι καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως οἱ Σοδομῖται περιεκύκλωσαν τὴν οἰκίαν ἀπὸ νεανίσκου ἕως πρεσβυτέρου ἅπας ὁ λαὸς ἅμα
5 καὶ ἐξεκαλοῦντο τὸν Λωτ καὶ ἔλεγον πρὸς αὐτόν ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ εἰσελθόντες πρὸς σὲ τὴν νύκτα ἐξάγαγε αὐτοὺς πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἵνα συγγενώμεθα αὐτοῖς
6 ἐξῆλθεν δὲ Λωτ πρὸς αὐτοὺς πρὸς τὸ πρόθυρον τὴν δὲ θύραν προσέῳξεν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ
7 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτούς μηδαμῶς ἀδελφοί μὴ πονηρεύσησθε
8 εἰσὶν δέ μοι δύο θυγατέρες αἳ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ἄνδρα ἐξάξω αὐτὰς πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ χρήσασθε αὐταῖς καθὰ ἂν ἀρέσκῃ ὑμῖν μόνον εἰς τοὺς ἄνδρας τούτους μὴ ποιήσητε μηδὲν ἄδικον οὗ εἵνεκεν εἰσῆλθον ὑπὸ τὴν σκέπην τῶν δοκῶν μου
9 εἶπαν δέ ἀπόστα ἐκεῖ εἷς ἦλθες παροικεῖν μὴ καὶ κρίσιν κρίνειν νῦν οὖν σὲ κακώσομεν μᾶλλον ἢ ἐκείνους καὶ παρεβιάζοντο τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν Λωτ σφόδρα καὶ ἤγγισαν συντρῖψαι τὴν θύραν
10 ἐκτείναντες δὲ οἱ ἄνδρες τὰς χεῖρας εἰσεσπάσαντο τὸν Λωτ πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς εἰς τὸν οἶκον καὶ τὴν θύραν τοῦ οἴκου ἀπέκλεισαν
11 τοὺς δὲ ἄνδρας τοὺς ὄντας ἐπὶ τῆς θύρας τοῦ οἴκου ἐπάταξαν ἀορασίᾳ ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου καὶ παρελύθησαν ζητοῦντες τὴν θύραν

12 εἶπαν δὲ οἱ ἄνδρες πρὸς Λωτ ἔστιν τίς σοι ὧδε γαμβροὶ ἢ υἱοὶ ἢ θυγατέρες ἢ εἴ τίς σοι ἄλλος ἔστιν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐξάγαγε ἐκ τοῦ τόπου τούτου
13 ὅτι ἀπόλλυμεν ἡμεῖς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον ὅτι ὑψώθη ἡ κραυγὴ αὐτῶν ἐναντίον κυρίου καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἡμᾶς κύριος ἐκτρῖψαι αὐτήν
14 ἐξῆλθεν δὲ Λωτ καὶ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς τοὺς γαμβροὺς αὐτοῦ τοὺς εἰληφότας τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ἀνάστητε καὶ ἐξέλθατε ἐκ τοῦ τόπου τούτου ὅτι ἐκτρίβει κύριος τὴν πόλιν ἔδοξεν δὲ γελοιάζειν ἐναντίον τῶν γαμβρῶν αὐτοῦ
15 ἡνίκα δὲ ὄρθρος ἐγίνετο ἐπεσπούδαζον οἱ ἄγγελοι τὸν Λωτ λέγοντες ἀναστὰς λαβὲ τὴν γυναῖκά σου καὶ τὰς δύο θυγατέρας σου ἃς ἔχεις καὶ ἔξελθε ἵνα μὴ συναπόλῃ ταῖς ἀνομίαις τῆς πόλεως
16 καὶ ἐταράχθησαν καὶ ἐκράτησαν οἱ ἄγγελοι τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῆς χειρὸς τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν χειρῶν τῶν δύο θυγατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ φείσασθαι κύριον αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἐξήγαγον αὐτοὺς ἔξω καὶ εἶπαν σῴζων σῷζε τὴν σεαυτοῦ ψυχήν μὴ περιβλέψῃς εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω μηδὲ στῇς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ περιχώρῳ εἰς τὸ ὄρος σῴζου μήποτε συμπαραλημφθῇς

18 εἶπεν δὲ Λωτ πρὸς αὐτούς δέομαι κύριε
19 ἐπειδὴ εὗρεν ὁ παῖς σου ἔλεος ἐναντίον σου καὶ ἐμεγάλυνας τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου ὃ ποιεῖς ἐ{P'} ἐμέ τοῦ ζῆν τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐγὼ δὲ οὐ δυνήσομαι διασωθῆναι εἰς τὸ ὄρος μὴ καταλάβῃ με τὰ κακὰ καὶ ἀποθάνω
20 ἰδοὺ ἡ πόλις αὕτη ἐγγὺς τοῦ καταφυγεῖν με ἐκεῖ ἥ ἐστιν μικρά ἐκεῖ σωθήσομαι οὐ μικρά ἐστιν καὶ ζήσεται ἡ ψυχή μου
21 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἰδοὺ ἐθαύμασά σου τὸ πρόσωπον καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ῥήματι τούτῳ τοῦ μὴ καταστρέψαι τὴν πόλιν περὶ ἧς ἐλάλησας
22 σπεῦσον οὖν τοῦ σωθῆναι ἐκεῖ οὐ γὰρ δυνήσομαι ποιῆσαι πρᾶγμα ἕως τοῦ σε εἰσελθεῖν ἐκεῖ διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως ἐκείνης Σηγωρ
23 ὁ ἥλιος ἐξῆλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ Λωτ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Σηγωρ
24 καὶ κύριος ἔβρεξεν ἐπὶ Σοδομα καὶ Γομορρα θεῖον καὶ πῦρ παρὰ κυρίου ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ
25 καὶ κατέστρεψεν τὰς πόλεις ταύτας καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν περίοικον καὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν καὶ πάντα τὰ ἀνατέλλοντα ἐκ τῆς γῆς
26 καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω καὶ ἐγένετο στήλη ἁλός
27 ὤρθρισεν δὲ Αβρααμ τὸ πρωὶ εἰς τὸν τόπον οὗ εἱστήκει ἐναντίον κυρίου
28 καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Σοδομων καὶ Γομορρας καὶ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς τῆς περιχώρου καὶ εἶδεν καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνέβαινεν φλὸξ τῆς γῆς ὡσεὶ ἀτμὶς καμίνου
29 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐκτρῖψαι κύριον πάσας τὰς πόλεις τῆς περιοίκου ἐμνήσθη ὁ θεὸς τοῦ Αβρααμ καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν τὸν Λωτ ἐκ μέσου τῆς καταστροφῆς ἐν τῷ καταστρέψαι κύριον τὰς πόλεις ἐν αἷς κατῴκει ἐν αὐταῖς Λωτ

30 ἀνέβη δὲ Λωτ ἐκ Σηγωρ καὶ ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ ὄρει καὶ αἱ δύο θυγατέρες αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐφοβήθη γὰρ κατοικῆσαι ἐν Σηγωρ καὶ ᾤκησεν ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ αὐτὸς καὶ αἱ δύο θυγατέρες αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ
31 εἶπεν δὲ ἡ πρεσβυτέρα πρὸς τὴν νεωτέραν ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν πρεσβύτερος καὶ οὐδείς ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ὃς εἰσελεύσεται πρὸς ἡμᾶς ὡς καθήκει πάσῃ τῇ γῇ
32 δεῦρο καὶ ποτίσωμεν τὸν πατέρα ἡμῶν οἶνον καὶ κοιμηθῶμεν με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξαναστήσωμεν ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σπέρμα
33 ἐπότισαν δὲ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν οἶνον ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα ἡ πρεσβυτέρα ἐκοιμήθη μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην καὶ οὐκ ᾔδει ἐν τῷ κοιμηθῆναι αὐτὴν καὶ ἀναστῆναι
34 ἐγένετο δὲ τῇ ἐπαύριον καὶ εἶπεν ἡ πρεσβυτέρα πρὸς τὴν νεωτέραν ἰδοὺ ἐκοιμήθην ἐχθὲς μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν ποτίσωμεν αὐτὸν οἶνον καὶ τὴν νύκτα ταύτην καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα κοιμήθητι με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξαναστήσωμεν ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σπέρμα
35 ἐπότισαν δὲ καὶ ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν οἶνον καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα ἡ νεωτέρα ἐκοιμήθη μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ οὐκ ᾔδει ἐν τῷ κοιμηθῆναι αὐτὴν καὶ ἀναστῆναι
36 καὶ συνέλαβον αἱ δύο θυγατέρες Λωτ ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν
37 καὶ ἔτεκεν ἡ πρεσβυτέρα υἱὸν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Μωαβ λέγουσα ἐκ τοῦ πατρός μου οὗτος πατὴρ Μωαβιτῶν ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας
38 ἔτεκεν δὲ καὶ ἡ νεωτέρα υἱὸν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Αμμαν υἱὸς τοῦ γένους μου οὗτος πατὴρ Αμμανιτῶν ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας
