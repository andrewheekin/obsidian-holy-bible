# Book of Genesis 33 (RSVCE)

### Jacob and Esau Meet
1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids.
2 And he put the maids with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.
3 He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
4 But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
5 And when Esau raised his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, “Who are these with you?” Jacob said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”
6 Then the maids drew near, they and their children, and bowed down;
7 Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down; and last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down.
8 Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?” Jacob answered, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.”
9 But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.”
10 Jacob said, “No, I pray you, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand; for truly to see your face is like seeing the face of God, with such favor have you received me.
11 Accept, I pray you, my gift that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” Thus he urged him, and he took it.
12 Then Esau said, “Let us journey on our way, and I will go before you.”
13 But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the flocks and herds giving suck are a care to me; and if they are overdriven for one day, all the flocks will die.
14 Let my lord pass on before his servant, and I will lead on slowly, according to the pace of the cattle which are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seʹir.”
15 So Esau said, “Let me leave with you some of the men who are with me.” But he said, “What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”
16 So Esau returned that day on his way to Seʹir.
17 But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house, and made booths for his cattle; therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
### Jacob Reaches Shechem
18 And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram; and he camped before the city.
19 And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, he bought for a hundred pieces of money the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent.
20 There he erected an altar and called it El-Elʹohe-Israel.


# Liber Genesis 33 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Elevans autem Jacob oculos suos, vidit venientem Esau, et cum eo quadringentos viros: divisitque filios Liæ et Rachel, ambarumque famularum:
2 et posuit utramque ancillam, et liberos earum, in principio: Liam vero, et filios ejus, in secundo loco: Rachel autem et Joseph novissimos.
3 Et ipse progrediens adoravit pronus in terram septies, donec appropinquaret frater ejus.
4 Currens itaque Esau obviam fratri suo, amplexatus est eum: stringensque collum ejus, et osculans flevit.
5 Levatisque oculis, vidit mulieres et parvulos earum, et ait: Quid sibi volunt isti? et si ad te pertinent? Respondit: Parvuli sunt quos donavit mihi Deus servo tuo.
6 Et appropinquantes ancillæ et filii earum, incurvati sunt.
7 Accessit quoque Lia cum pueris suis: et cum similiter adorassent, extremi Joseph et Rachel adoraverunt.

8 Dixitque Esau: Quænam sunt istæ turmæ quas obviam habui? Respondit: Ut invenirem gratiam coram domino meo.
9 At ille ait: Habeo plurima, frater mi, sint tua tibi.
10 Dixitque Jacob: Noli ita, obsecro: sed si inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, accipe munusculum de manibus meis. Sic enim vidi faciem tuam, quasi viderim vultum Dei: esto mihi propitius,
11 et suscipe benedictionem quam attuli tibi, et quam donavit mihi Deus tribuens omnia. Vix fratre compellente, suscipiens,
12 ait: Gradiamur simul, eroque socius itineris tui.
13 Dixitque Jacob: Nosti, domine mi, quod parvulos habeam teneros, et oves, et boves fœtas mecum: quas si plus in ambulando fecero laborare, morientur una die cuncti greges.
14 Præcedat dominus meus ante servum suum: et ego sequar paulatim vestigia ejus, sicut videro parvulos meos posse, donec veniam ad dominum meum in Seir.
15 Respondit Esau: Oro te, ut de populo qui mecum est, saltem socri remaneant viæ tuæ. Non est, inquit, necesse: hoc uno tantum indigeo, ut inveniam gratiam in conspectu tuo, domine mi.

16 Reversus est itaque illo die Esau itinere quo venerat in Seir.
17 Et Jacob venit in Socoth: ubi ædificata domo et fixis tentoriis appellavit nomen loci illius Socoth, id est, Tabernacula.
18 Transivitque in Salem urbem Sichimorum, quæ est in terra Chanaan, postquam reversus est de Mesopotamia Syriæ: et habitavit juxta oppidum.
19 Emitque partem agri, in qua fixerat tabernacula, a filiis Hemor patris Sichem centum agnis.
20 Et erecto ibi altari, invocavit super illud fortissimum Deum Israël.


# Γένεσις 33 (Septuagint)

1 ἀναβλέψας δὲ Ιακωβ εἶδεν καὶ ἰδοὺ Ησαυ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐρχόμενος καὶ τετρακόσιοι ἄνδρες με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπιδιεῖλεν Ιακωβ τὰ παιδία ἐπὶ Λειαν καὶ Ραχηλ καὶ τὰς δύο παιδίσκας
2 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὰς δύο παιδίσκας καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν ἐν πρώτοις καὶ Λειαν καὶ τὰ παιδία αὐτῆς ὀπίσω καὶ Ραχηλ καὶ Ιωσηφ ἐσχάτους
3 αὐτὸς δὲ προῆλθεν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν καὶ προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἑπτάκις ἕως τοῦ ἐγγίσαι τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ
4 καὶ προσέδραμεν Ησαυ εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ καὶ περιλαβὼν αὐτὸν ἐφίλησεν καὶ προσέπεσεν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔκλαυσαν ἀμφότεροι
5 καὶ ἀναβλέψας εἶδεν τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ τὰ παιδία καὶ εἶπεν τί ταῦτά σοί ἐστιν ὁ δὲ εἶπεν τὰ παιδία οἷς ἠλέησεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν παῖδά σου
6 καὶ προσήγγισαν αἱ παιδίσκαι καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν καὶ προσεκύνησαν
7 καὶ προσήγγισεν Λεια καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς καὶ προσεκύνησαν καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα προσήγγισεν Ραχηλ καὶ Ιωσηφ καὶ προσεκύνησαν

8 καὶ εἶπεν τί ταῦτά σοί ἐστιν πᾶσαι αἱ παρεμβολαὶ αὗται αἷς ἀπήντηκα ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ἵνα εὕρῃ ὁ παῖς σου χάριν ἐναντίον σου κύριε
9 εἶπεν δὲ Ησαυ ἔστιν μοι πολλά ἄδελφε ἔστω σοι τὰ σά
10 εἶπεν δὲ Ιακωβ εἰ εὕρηκα χάριν ἐναντίον σου δέξαι τὰ δῶρα διὰ τῶν ἐμῶν χειρῶν ἕνεκεν τούτου εἶδον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ὡς ἄν τις ἴδοι πρόσωπον θεοῦ καὶ εὐδοκήσεις με
11 λαβὲ τὰς εὐλογίας μου ἃς ἤνεγκά σοι ὅτι ἠλέησέν με ὁ θεὸς καὶ ἔστιν μοι πάντα καὶ ἐβιάσατο αὐτόν καὶ ἔλαβεν
12 καὶ εἶπεν ἀπάραντες πορευσόμεθα ἐ{P'} εὐθεῖαν
13 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ κύριός μου γινώσκει ὅτι τὰ παιδία ἁπαλώτερα καὶ τὰ πρόβατα καὶ αἱ βόες λοχεύονται ἐ{P'} ἐμέ ἐὰν οὖν καταδιώξω αὐτοὺς ἡμέραν μίαν ἀποθανοῦνται πάντα τὰ κτήνη
14 προελθέτω ὁ κύριός μου ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ παιδός ἐγὼ δὲ ἐνισχύσω ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ κατὰ σχολὴν τῆς πορεύσεως τῆς ἐναντίον μου καὶ κατὰ πόδα τῶν παιδαρίων ἕως τοῦ με ἐλθεῖν πρὸς τὸν κύριόν μου εἰς Σηιρ
15 εἶπεν δὲ Ησαυ καταλείψω μετὰ σοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ με{T'} ἐμοῦ ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ἵνα τί τοῦτο ἱκανὸν ὅτι εὗρον χάριν ἐναντίον σου κύριε

16 ἀπέστρεψεν δὲ Ησαυ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς Σηιρ
17 καὶ Ιακωβ ἀπαίρει εἰς Σκηνάς καὶ ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ ἐκεῖ οἰκίας καὶ τοῖς κτήνεσιν αὐτοῦ ἐποίησεν σκηνάς διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου Σκηναί
18 καὶ ἦλθεν Ιακωβ εἰς Σαλημ πόλιν Σικιμων ἥ ἐστιν ἐν γῇ Χανααν ὅτε ἦλθεν ἐκ τῆς Μεσοποταμίας Συρίας καὶ παρενέβαλεν κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς πόλεως
19 καὶ ἐκτήσατο τὴν μερίδα τοῦ ἀγροῦ οὗ ἔστησεν ἐκεῖ τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ παρὰ Εμμωρ πατρὸς Συχεμ ἑκατὸν ἀμνῶν
20 καὶ ἔστησεν ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν θεὸν Ισραηλ
