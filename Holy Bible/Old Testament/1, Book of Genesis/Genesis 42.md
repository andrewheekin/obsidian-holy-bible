# Book of Genesis 42 (RSVCE)

### Joseph’s Brothers Go to Egypt
1 When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”
2 And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live, and not die.”
3 So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.
4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might befall him.
5 Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
6 Now Joseph was governor over the land; he it was who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.
7 Joseph saw his brothers, and knew them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. “Where do you come from?” he said. They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”
8 Thus Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.
9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed of them; and he said to them, “You are spies, you have come to see the weakness of the land.”
10 They said to him, “No, my lord, but to buy food have your servants come.
11 We are all sons of one man, we are honest men, your servants are not spies.”
12 He said to them, “No, it is the weakness of the land that you have come to see.”
13 And they said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.”
14 But Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you, you are spies.
15 By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
16 Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain in prison, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.”
17 And he put them all together in prison for three days.
18 On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God:
19 if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined in your prison, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households,
20 and bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die.” And they did so.
21 Then they said to one another, “In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us and we would not listen; therefore is this distress come upon us.”
22 And Reuben answered them, “Did I not tell you not to sin against the lad? But you would not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.”
23 They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them.
24 Then he turned away from them and wept; and he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
25 And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man’s money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.
### Joseph’s Brothers Return to Canaan
26 Then they loaded their asses with their grain, and departed.
27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack;
28 and he said to his brothers, “My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!” At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”
29 When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had befallen them, saying,
30 “The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the land.
31 But we said to him, ‘We are honest men, we are not spies;
32 we are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.’
33 Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way.
34 Bring your youngest brother to me; then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver to you your brother, and you shall trade in the land.’ ”
35 As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were dismayed.
36 And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin; all this has come upon me.”
37 Then Reuben said to his father, “Slay my two sons if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.”
38 But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm should befall him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”


# Liber Genesis 42 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Audiens autem Jacob quod alimenta venderentur in Ægypto, dixit filiis suis: Quare negligitis?
2 audivi quod triticum venundetur in Ægypto: descendite, et emite nobis necessaria, ut possimus vivere, et non consumamur inopia.
3 Descendentes igitur fratres Joseph decem, ut emerent frumenta in Ægypto,
4 Benjamin domi retento a Jacob, qui dixerat fratribus ejus: Ne forte in itinere quidquam patiatur mali:
5 ingressi sunt terram Ægypti cum aliis qui pergebant ad emendum. Erat autem fames in terra Chanaan.

6 Et Joseph erat princeps in terra Ægypti, atque ad ejus nutum frumenta populis vendebantur. Cumque adorassent eum fratres sui,
7 et agnovisset eos, quasi ad alienos durius loquebatur, interrogans eos: Unde venistis? Qui responderunt: De terra Chanaan, ut emamus victui necessaria.
8 Et tamen fratres ipse cognoscens, non est cognitus ab eis.
9 Recordatusque somniorum, quæ aliquando viderat, ait ad eos: Exploratores estis: ut videatis infirmiora terræ venistis.
10 Qui dixerunt: Non est ita, domine, sed servi tui venerunt ut emerent cibos.
11 Omnes filii unius viri sumus: pacifici venimus, nec quidquam famuli tui machinantur mali.
12 Quibus ille respondit: Aliter est: immunita terræ hujus considerare venistis.
13 At illi: Duodecim, inquiunt, servi tui, fratres sumus, filii viri unius in terra Chanaan: minimus cum patre nostro est, alius non est super.
14 Hoc est, ait, quod locutus sum: exploratores estis.
15 Jam nunc experimentum vestri capiam: per salutem Pharaonis non egrediemini hinc, donec veniat frater vester minimus.
16 Mittite ex vobis unum, et adducat eum: vos autem eritis in vinculis, donec probentur quæ dixistis utrum vera an falsa sint: alioquin per salutem Pharaonis exploratores estis.

17 Tradidit ergo illos custodiæ tribus diebus.
18 Die autem tertio eductis de carcere, ait: Facite quæ dixi, et vivetis: Deum enim timeo.
19 Si pacifici estis, frater vester unus ligetur in carcere: vos autem abite, et ferte frumenta quæ emistis, in domos vestras,
20 et fratrem vestrum minimum ad me adducite, ut possim vestros probare sermones, et non moriamini. Fecerunt ut dixerat,
21 et locuti sunt ad invicem: Merito hæc patimur, quia peccavimus in fratrem nostrum, videntes angustiam animæ illius, dum deprecaretur nos, et non audivimus: idcirco venit super nos ista tribulatio.
22 E quibus unus Ruben, ait: Numquid non dixi vobis: Nolite peccare in puerum: et non audistis me? en sanguis ejus exquiritur.
23 Nesciebant autem quod intelligeret Joseph, eo quod per interpretem loqueretur ad eos.
24 Avertitque se parumper, et flevit: et reversus locutus est ad eos.
25 Tollensque Simeon, et ligans illis præsentibus, jussit ministris ut implerent eorum saccos tritico, et reponerent pecunias singulorum in sacculis suis, datis supra cibariis in viam: qui fecerunt ita.
26 At illi portantes frumenta in asinis suis, profecti sunt.
27 Apertoque unus sacco, ut daret jumento pabulum in diversorio, contemplatus pecuniam in ore sacculi,
28 dixit fratribus suis: Reddita est mihi pecunia, en habetur in sacco. Et obstupefacti, turbatique, mutuo dixerunt: Quidnam est hoc quod fecit nobis Deus?

29 Veneruntque ad Jacob patrem suum in terram Chanaan, et narraverunt ei omnia quæ accidissent sibi, dicentes:
30 Locutus est nobis dominus terræ dure, et putavit nos exploratores esse provinciæ.
31 Cui respondimus: Pacifici sumus, nec ullas molimur insidias.
32 Duodecim fratres uno patre geniti sumus: unus non est super, minimus cum patre nostro est in terra Chanaan.
33 Qui ait nobis: Sic probabo quod pacifici sitis: fratrem vestrum unum dimittite apud me, et cibaria domibus vestris necessaria sumite, et abite,
34 fratremque vestrum minimum adducite ad me, ut sciam quod non sitis exploratores: et istum, qui tenetur in vinculis, recipere possitis: ac deinceps quæ vultis, emendi habeatis licentiam.
35 His dictis, cum frumenta effunderent, singuli repererunt in ore saccorum ligatas pecunias, exterritisque simul omnibus,
36 dixit pater Jacob: Absque liberis me esse fecistis: Joseph non est super, Simeon tenetur in vinculis, et Benjamin auferetis: in me hæc omnia mala reciderunt.
37 Cui respondit Ruben: Duos filios meos interfice, si non reduxero illum tibi: trade illum in manu mea, et ego eum tibi restituam.
38 At ille: Non descendet, inquit, filius meus vobiscum: frater ejus mortuus est, et ipse solus remansit: si quid ei adversi acciderit in terra ad quam pergitis, deducetis canos meos cum dolore ad inferos.

1 ἰδὼν δὲ Ιακωβ ὅτι ἔστιν πρᾶσις ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ εἶπεν τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ ἵνα τί ῥᾳθυμεῖτε

8 ἐπέγνω δὲ Ιωσηφ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἐπέγνωσαν αὐτόν
9 καὶ ἐμνήσθη Ιωσηφ τῶν ἐνυπνίων ὧν εἶδεν αὐτός καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς κατάσκοποί ἐστε κατανοῆσαι τὰ ἴχνη τῆς χώρας ἥκατε
10 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν οὐχί κύριε οἱ παῖδές σου ἤλθομεν πρίασθαι βρώματα
11 πάντες ἐσμὲν υἱοὶ ἑνὸς ἀνθρώπου εἰρηνικοί ἐσμεν οὐκ εἰσὶν οἱ παῖδές σου κατάσκοποι

13 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν δώδεκά ἐσμεν οἱ παῖδές σου ἀδελφοὶ ἐν γῇ Χανααν καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ νεώτερος μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σήμερον ὁ δὲ ἕτερος οὐχ ὑπάρχει
14 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ τοῦτό ἐστιν ὃ εἴρηκα ὑμῖν λέγων ὅτι κατάσκοποί ἐστε
15 ἐν τούτῳ φανεῖσθε νὴ τὴν ὑγίειαν Φαραω οὐ μὴ ἐξέλθητε ἐντεῦθεν ἐὰν μὴ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος ἔλθῃ ὧδε

17 καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοὺς ἐν φυλακῇ ἡμέρας τρεῖς
18 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ τοῦτο ποιήσατε καὶ ζήσεσθε τὸν θεὸν γὰρ ἐγὼ φοβοῦμαι
19 εἰ εἰρηνικοί ἐστε ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν εἷς κατασχεθήτω ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ αὐτοὶ δὲ βαδίσατε καὶ ἀπαγάγετε τὸν ἀγορασμὸν τῆς σιτοδοσίας ὑμῶν

21 καὶ εἶπεν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ναί ἐν ἁμαρτίᾳ γάρ ἐσμεν περὶ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ ἡμῶν ὅτι ὑπερείδομεν τὴν θλῖψιν τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ ὅτε κατεδέετο ἡμῶν καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσαμεν αὐτοῦ ἕνεκεν τούτου ἐπῆλθεν ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς ἡ θλῖψις αὕτη
22 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ρουβην εἶπεν αὐτοῖς οὐκ ἐλάλησα ὑμῖν λέγων μὴ ἀδικήσητε τὸ παιδάριον καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατέ μου καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐκζητεῖται
23 αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν ὅτι ἀκούει Ιωσηφ ὁ γὰρ ἑρμηνευτὴς ἀνὰ μέσον αὐτῶν ἦν
24 ἀποστραφεὶς δὲ ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν ἔκλαυσεν Ιωσηφ καὶ πάλιν προσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸν Συμεων ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν
25 ἐνετείλατο δὲ Ιωσηφ ἐμπλῆσαι τὰ ἀγγεῖα αὐτῶν σίτου καὶ ἀποδοῦναι τὸ ἀργύριον ἑκάστου εἰς τὸν σάκκον αὐτοῦ καὶ δοῦναι αὐτοῖς ἐπισιτισμὸν εἰς τὴν ὁδόν καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτοῖς οὕτως

28 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ ἀπεδόθη μοι τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ ἰδοὺ τοῦτο ἐν τῷ μαρσίππῳ μου καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν καὶ ἐταράχθησαν πρὸς ἀλλήλους λέγοντες τί τοῦτο ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς ἡμῖν

29 ἦλθον δὲ πρὸς Ιακωβ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν εἰς γῆν Χανααν καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ συμβάντα αὐτοῖς λέγοντες
30 λελάληκεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ κύριος τῆς γῆς πρὸς ἡμᾶς σκληρὰ καὶ ἔθετο ἡμᾶς ἐν φυλακῇ ὡς κατασκοπεύοντας τὴν γῆν

36 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ιακωβ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν ἐμὲ ἠτεκνώσατε Ιωσηφ οὐκ ἔστιν Συμεων οὐκ ἔστιν καὶ τὸν Βενιαμιν λήμψεσθε ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ ἐγένετο πάντα ταῦτα
37 εἶπεν δὲ Ρουβην τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ λέγων τοὺς δύο υἱούς μου ἀπόκτεινον ἐὰν μὴ ἀγάγω αὐτὸν πρὸς σέ δὸς αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν χεῖρά μου κἀγὼ ἀνάξω αὐτὸν πρὸς σέ
38 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν οὐ καταβήσεται ὁ υἱός μου με{Q'} ὑμῶν ὅτι ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπέθανεν καὶ αὐτὸς μόνος καταλέλειπται καὶ συμβήσεται αὐτὸν μαλακισθῆναι ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἂν πορεύησθε καὶ κατάξετέ μου τὸ γῆρας μετὰ λύπης εἰς ᾅδου
