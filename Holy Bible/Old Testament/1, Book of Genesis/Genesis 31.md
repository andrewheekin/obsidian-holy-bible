# Book of Genesis 31 (RSVCE)

### Jacob Flees with Family and Flocks
1 Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, “Jacob has taken all that was our father’s; and from what was our father’s he has gained all this wealth.”
2 And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.
3 Then theLordsaid to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.”
4 So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was,
5 and said to them, “I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me.
6 You know that I have served your father with all my strength;
7 yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not permit him to harm me.
8 If he said, ‘The spotted shall be your wages,’ then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, ‘The striped shall be your wages,’ then all the flock bore striped.
9 Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
10 In the mating season of the flock I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream that the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled.
11 Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am!’
12 And he said, ‘Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that leap upon the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.
13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go forth from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’ ”
14 Then Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father’s house?
15 Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has been using up the money given for us.
16 All the property which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children; now then, whatever God has said to you, do.”
17 So Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives on camels;
18 and he drove away all his cattle, all his livestock which he had gained, the cattle in his possession which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.
19 Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father’s household gods.
20 And Jacob outwitted Laban the Arameʹan, in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee.
21 He fled with all that he had, and arose and crossed the Euphraʹtes, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
### Laban Overtakes Jacob
22 When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,
23 he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.
24 But God came to Laban the Arameʹan in a dream by night, and said to him, “Take heed that you say not a word to Jacob, either good or bad.”
25 And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen encamped in the hill country of Gilead.
26 And Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have cheated me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?
27 Why did you flee secretly, and cheat me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre?
28 And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly.
29 It is in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Take heed that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.’
30 And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father’s house, but why did you steal my gods?”
31 Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.
32 Any one with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
33 So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered Rachel’s.
34 Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat upon them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them.
35 And she said to her father, “Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me.” So he searched, but did not find the household gods.
36 Then Jacob became angry, and upbraided Laban; Jacob said to Laban, “What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?
37 Although you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.
38 These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your she-goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.
39 That which was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself; of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
40 Thus I was; by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
41 These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”
### Laban and Jacob Make a Covenant
43 Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?
44 Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be a witness between you and me.”
45 So Jacob took a stone, and set it up as a pillar.
46 And Jacob said to his kinsmen, “Gather stones,” and they took stones, and made a heap; and they ate there by the heap.
47 Laban called it Jeʹgar-sahaduʹtha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
48 Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me today.” Therefore he named it Galeed,
49 and the pillar Mizpah, for he said, “TheLordwatch between you and me, when we are absent one from the other.
50 If you ill-treat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us, remember, God is witness between you and me.”
51 Then Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me.
52 This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
53 The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,
54 and Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his kinsmen to eat bread; and they ate bread and tarried all night on the mountain.
55 Early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them; then he departed and returned home.


# Liber Genesis 31 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Postquam autem audivit verba filiorum Laban dicentium: Tulit Jacob omnia quæ fuerunt patris nostri, et de illius facultate ditatus, factus est inclytus:
2 animadvertit quoque faciem Laban, quod non esset erga se sicut heri et nudiustertius,
3 maxime dicente sibi Domino: Revertere in terram patrum tuorum, et ad generationem tuam, eroque tecum.
4 Misit, et vocavit Rachel et Liam in agrum, ubi pascebat greges,
5 dixitque eis: Video faciem patris vestri quod non sit erga me sicut heri et nudiustertius: Deus autem patris mei fuit mecum.
6 Et ipsæ nostis quod totis viribus meis servierim patri vestro.
7 Sed et pater vester circumvenit me et mutavit mercedem meam decem vicibus: et tamen non dimisit eum Deus ut noceret mihi.
8 Si quando dixit: Variæ erunt mercedes tuæ: pariebant omnes oves varios fœtus; quando vero e contrario, ait: Alba quæque accipies pro mercede: omnes greges alba pepererunt.
9 Tulitque Deus substantiam patris vestri, et dedit mihi.
10 Postquam enim conceptus ovium tempus advenerat, levavi oculos meos, et vidi in somnis ascendentes mares super feminas, varios et maculosos, et diversorum colorum.
11 Dixitque angelus Dei ad me in somnis: Jacob? Et ego respondi: Adsum.
12 Qui ait: Leva oculos tuos, et vide universos masculos ascendentes super feminas, varios, maculosos, atque respersos. Vidi enim omnia quæ fecit tibi Laban.
13 Ego sum Deus Bethel, ubi unxisti lapidem, et votum vovisti mihi. Nunc ergo surge, et egredere de terra hac, revertens in terram nativitatis tuæ.
14 Responderuntque Rachel et Lia: Numquid habemus residui quidquam in facultatibus et hæreditate domus patris nostri?
15 nonne quasi alienas reputavit nos, et vendidit, comeditque pretium nostrum?
16 Sed Deus tulit opes patris nostri, et eas tradidit nobis, ac filiis nostris: unde omnia quæ præcepit tibi Deus, fac.

17 Surrexit itaque Jacob, et impositis liberis ac conjugibus suis super camelos, abiit.
18 Tulitque omnem substantiam suam, et greges, et quidquid in Mesopotamia acquisierat, pergens ad Isaac patrem suum in terram Chanaan.
19 Eo tempore ierat Laban ad tondendas oves, et Rachel furata est idola patris sui.
20 Noluitque Jacob confiteri socero suo quod fugeret.
21 Cumque abiisset tam ipse quam omnia quæ juris sui erant, et amne transmisso pergeret contra montem Galaad,
22 nuntiatum est Laban die tertio quod fugeret Jacob.
23 Qui, assumptis fratribus suis, persecutus est eum diebus septem: et comprehendit eum in monte Galaad.
24 Viditque in somnis dicentem sibi Deum: Cave ne quidquam aspere loquaris contra Jacob.
25 Jamque Jacob extenderat in monte tabernaculum: cumque ille consecutus fuisset eum cum fratribus suis, in eodem monte Galaad fixit tentorium.
26 Et dixit ad Jacob: Quare ita egisti, ut clam me abigeres filias meas quasi captivas gladio?
27 cur ignorante me fugere voluisti, nec indicare mihi, ut prosequerer te cum gaudio, et canticis, et tympanis, et citharis?
28 Non es passus ut oscularer filios meos et filias: stulte operatus es: et nunc quidem
29 valet manus mea reddere tibi malum: sed Deus patris vestri heri dixit mihi: Cave ne loquaris contra Jacob quidquam durius.
30 Esto, ad tuos ire cupiebas, et desiderio erat tibi domus patris tui: cur furatus es deos meos?
31 Respondit Jacob: Quod inscio te profectus sum, timui ne violenter auferres filias tuas.
32 Quod autem furti me arguis: apud quemcumque inveneris deos tuos, necetur coram fratribus nostris: scrutare, quidquid tuorum apud me inveneris, et aufer. Hæc dicens, ignorabat quod Rachel furata esset idola.

33 Ingressus itaque Laban tabernaculum Jacob, et Liæ, et utriusque famulæ, non invenit. Cumque intrasset tentorium Rachelis,
34 illa festinans abscondit idola subter stramenta cameli, et sedit desuper: scrutantique omne tentorium, et nihil invenienti,
35 ait: Ne irascatur dominus meus quod coram te assurgere nequeo: quia juxta consuetudinem feminarum nunc accidit mihi: sic delusa sollicitudo quærentis est.
36 Tumensque Jacob, cum jurgio ait: Quam ob culpam meam, et ob quod peccatum meum sic exarsisti post me,
37 et scrutatus es omnem supellectilem meam? quid invenisti de cuncta substantia domus tuæ? pone hic coram fratribus meis, et fratribus tuis, et judicent inter me et te.
38 Idcirco viginti annis fui tecum? oves tuæ et capræ steriles non fuerunt, arietes gregis tui non comedi:
39 nec captum a bestia ostendi tibi, ego damnum omne reddebam: quidquid furto peribat, a me exigebas:
40 die noctuque æstu urebar, et gelu, fugiebatque somnus ab oculis meis.
41 Sicque per viginti annos in domo tua servivi tibi, quatuordecim pro filiabus, et sex pro gregibus tuis: immutasti quoque mercedem meam decem vicibus.
42 Nisi Deus patris mei Abraham, et timor Isaac affuisset mihi, forsitan modo nudum me dimisisses: afflictionem meam et laborem manuum mearum respexit Deus, et arguit te heri.
43 Respondit ei Laban: Filiæ meæ et filii, et greges tui, et omnia quæ cernis, mea sunt: quid possum facere filiis et nepotibus meis?
44 Veni ergo, et ineamus fœdus, ut sit in testimonium inter me et te.

45 Tulit itaque Jacob lapidem, et erexit illum in titulum:
46 dixitque fratribus suis: Afferte lapides. Qui congregantes fecerunt tumulum, comederuntque super eum:
47 quem vocavit Laban Tumulum testis: et Jacob, Acervum testimonii, uterque juxta proprietatem linguæ suæ.
48 Dixitque Laban: Tumulus iste erit testis inter me et te hodie, et idcirco appellatum est nomen ejus Galaad, id est, Tumulus testis.
49 Intueatur et judicet Dominus inter nos quando recesserimus a nobis,
50 si afflixeris filias meas, et si introduxeris alias uxores super eas: nullus sermonis nostri testis est absque Deo, qui præsens respicit.
51 Dixitque rursus ad Jacob: En tumulus hic, et lapis quem erexi inter me et te,
52 testis erit: tumulus, inquam, iste et lapis sint in testimonium, si aut ego transiero illum pergens ad te, aut tu præterieris, malum mihi cogitans.
53 Deus Abraham, et Deus Nachor, judicet inter nos, Deus patris eorum. Juravit ergo Jacob per timorem patris sui Isaac:
54 immolatisque victimis in monte, vocavit fratres suos ut ederent panem. Qui cum comedissent, manserunt ibi:
55 Laban vero de nocte consurgens, osculatus est filios, et filias suas, et benedixit illis: reversusque est in locum suum.

1 ἤκουσεν δὲ Ιακωβ τὰ ῥήματα τῶν υἱῶν Λαβαν λεγόντων εἴληφεν Ιακωβ πάντα τὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ ἐκ τῶν τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν πεποίηκεν πᾶσαν τὴν δόξαν ταύτην
2 καὶ εἶδεν Ιακωβ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ Λαβαν καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἦν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὡς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν
3 εἶπεν δὲ κύριος πρὸς Ιακωβ ἀποστρέφου εἰς τὴν γῆν τοῦ πατρός σου καὶ εἰς τὴν γενεάν σου καὶ ἔσομαι μετὰ σοῦ
4 ἀποστείλας δὲ Ιακωβ ἐκάλεσεν Ραχηλ καὶ Λειαν εἰς τὸ πεδίον οὗ τὰ ποίμνια
5 καὶ εἶπεν αὐταῖς ὁρῶ ἐγὼ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν πρὸς ἐμοῦ ὡς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν ὁ δὲ θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου ἦν με{T'} ἐμοῦ
6 καὶ αὐταὶ δὲ οἴδατε ὅτι ἐν πάσῃ τῇ ἰσχύι μου δεδούλευκα τῷ πατρὶ ὑμῶν
7 ὁ δὲ πατὴρ ὑμῶν παρεκρούσατό με καὶ ἤλλαξεν τὸν μισθόν μου τῶν δέκα ἀμνῶν καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ θεὸς κακοποιῆσαί με
8 ἐὰν οὕτως εἴπῃ τὰ ποικίλα ἔσται σου μισθός καὶ τέξεται πάντα τὰ πρόβατα ποικίλα ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ τὰ λευκὰ ἔσται σου μισθός καὶ τέξεται πάντα τὰ πρόβατα λευκά
9 καὶ ἀφείλατο ὁ θεὸς πάντα τὰ κτήνη τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ἔδωκέν μοι αὐτά
10 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἐνεκίσσων τὰ πρόβατα καὶ εἶδον τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτὰ ἐν τῷ ὕπνῳ καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ τράγοι καὶ οἱ κριοὶ ἀναβαίνοντες ἦσαν ἐπὶ τὰ πρόβατα καὶ τὰς αἶγας διάλευκοι καὶ ποικίλοι καὶ σποδοειδεῖς ῥαντοί
11 καὶ εἶπέν μοι ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ κα{Q'} ὕπνον Ιακωβ ἐγὼ δὲ εἶπα τί ἐστιν
12 καὶ εἶπεν ἀνάβλεψον τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου καὶ ἰδὲ τοὺς τράγους καὶ τοὺς κριοὺς ἀναβαίνοντας ἐπὶ τὰ πρόβατα καὶ τὰς αἶγας διαλεύκους καὶ ποικίλους καὶ σποδοειδεῖς ῥαντούς ἑώρακα γὰρ ὅσα σοι Λαβαν ποιεῖ
13 ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ θεὸς ὁ ὀφθείς σοι ἐν τόπῳ θεοῦ οὗ ἤλειψάς μοι ἐκεῖ στήλην καὶ ηὔξω μοι ἐκεῖ εὐχήν νῦν οὖν ἀνάστηθι καὶ ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς γῆς ταύτης καὶ ἄπελθε εἰς τὴν γῆν τῆς γενέσεώς σου καὶ ἔσομαι μετὰ σοῦ
14 καὶ ἀποκριθεῖσα Ραχηλ καὶ Λεια εἶπαν αὐτῷ μὴ ἔστιν ἡμῖν ἔτι μερὶς ἢ κληρονομία ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν
15 οὐχ ὡς αἱ ἀλλότριαι λελογίσμεθα αὐτῷ πέπρακεν γὰρ ἡμᾶς καὶ κατέφαγεν καταβρώσει τὸ ἀργύριον ἡμῶν
16 πάντα τὸν πλοῦτον καὶ τὴν δόξαν ἣν ἀφείλατο ὁ θεὸς τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν ἡμῖν ἔσται καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ἡμῶν νῦν οὖν ὅσα εἴρηκέν σοι ὁ θεός ποίει

17 ἀναστὰς δὲ Ιακωβ ἔλαβεν τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ παιδία αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς καμήλους
18 καὶ ἀπήγαγεν πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀποσκευὴν αὐτοῦ ἣν περιεποιήσατο ἐν τῇ Μεσοποταμίᾳ καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ ἀπελθεῖν πρὸς Ισαακ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ εἰς γῆν Χανααν
19 Λαβαν δὲ ᾤχετο κεῖραι τὰ πρόβατα αὐτοῦ ἔκλεψεν δὲ Ραχηλ τὰ εἴδωλα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς
20 ἔκρυψεν δὲ Ιακωβ Λαβαν τὸν Σύρον τοῦ μὴ ἀναγγεῖλαι αὐτῷ ὅτι ἀποδιδράσκει
21 καὶ ἀπέδρα αὐτὸς καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ καὶ διέβη τὸν ποταμὸν καὶ ὥρμησεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος Γαλααδ
22 ἀνηγγέλη δὲ Λαβαν τῷ Σύρῳ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ὅτι ἀπέδρα Ιακωβ
23 καὶ παραλαβὼν πάντας τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ με{Q'} ἑαυτοῦ ἐδίωξεν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ ὁδὸν ἡμερῶν ἑπτὰ καὶ κατέλαβεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ Γαλααδ
24 ἦλθεν δὲ ὁ θεὸς πρὸς Λαβαν τὸν Σύρον κα{Q'} ὕπνον τὴν νύκτα καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ φύλαξαι σεαυτόν μήποτε λαλήσῃς μετὰ Ιακωβ πονηρά
25 καὶ κατέλαβεν Λαβαν τὸν Ιακωβ Ιακωβ δὲ ἔπηξεν τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Λαβαν δὲ ἔστησεν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Γαλααδ
26 εἶπεν δὲ Λαβαν τῷ Ιακωβ τί ἐποίησας ἵνα τί κρυφῇ ἀπέδρας καὶ ἐκλοποφόρησάς με καὶ ἀπήγαγες τὰς θυγατέρας μου ὡς αἰχμαλώτιδας μαχαίρᾳ
27 καὶ εἰ ἀνήγγειλάς μοι ἐξαπέστειλα ἄν σε με{T'} εὐφροσύνης καὶ μετὰ μουσικῶν τυμπάνων καὶ κιθάρας
28 οὐκ ἠξιώθην καταφιλῆσαι τὰ παιδία μου καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας μου νῦν δὲ ἀφρόνως ἔπραξας
29 καὶ νῦν ἰσχύει ἡ χείρ μου κακοποιῆσαί σε ὁ δὲ θεὸς τοῦ πατρός σου ἐχθὲς εἶπεν πρός με λέγων φύλαξαι σεαυτόν μήποτε λαλήσῃς μετὰ Ιακωβ πονηρά
30 νῦν οὖν πεπόρευσαι ἐπιθυμίᾳ γὰρ ἐπεθύμησας ἀπελθεῖν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός σου ἵνα τί ἔκλεψας τοὺς θεούς μου
31 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ιακωβ εἶπεν τῷ Λαβαν εἶπα γάρ μήποτε ἀφέλῃς τὰς θυγατέρας σου ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐμά
32 ἐπίγνωθι τί ἐστιν τῶν σῶν πα{R'} ἐμοί καὶ λαβέ καὶ οὐκ ἐπέγνω πα{R'} αὐτῷ οὐθέν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ιακωβ πα{R'} ᾧ ἐὰν εὕρῃς τοὺς θεούς σου οὐ ζήσεται ἐναντίον τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν οὐκ ᾔδει δὲ Ιακωβ ὅτι Ραχηλ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἔκλεψεν αὐτούς

33 εἰσελθὼν δὲ Λαβαν ἠρεύνησεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Λειας καὶ οὐχ εὗρεν καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου Λειας ἠρεύνησεν τὸν οἶκον Ιακωβ καὶ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τῶν δύο παιδισκῶν καὶ οὐχ εὗρεν εἰσῆλθεν δὲ καὶ εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ραχηλ
34 Ραχηλ δὲ ἔλαβεν τὰ εἴδωλα καὶ ἐνέβαλεν αὐτὰ εἰς τὰ σάγματα τῆς καμήλου καὶ ἐπεκάθισεν αὐτοῖς
35 καὶ εἶπεν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτῆς μὴ βαρέως φέρε κύριε οὐ δύναμαι ἀναστῆναι ἐνώπιόν σου ὅτι τὸ κα{T'} ἐθισμὸν τῶν γυναικῶν μοί ἐστιν ἠρεύνησεν δὲ Λαβαν ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ οἴκῳ καὶ οὐχ εὗρεν τὰ εἴδωλα
36 ὠργίσθη δὲ Ιακωβ καὶ ἐμαχέσατο τῷ Λαβαν ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ιακωβ εἶπεν τῷ Λαβαν τί τὸ ἀδίκημά μου καὶ τί τὸ ἁμάρτημά μου ὅτι κατεδίωξας ὀπίσω μου
37 καὶ ὅτι ἠρεύνησας πάντα τὰ σκεύη μου τί εὗρες ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν σκευῶν τοῦ οἴκου σου θὲς ὧδε ἐναντίον τῶν ἀδελφῶν μου καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου καὶ ἐλεγξάτωσαν ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν δύο ἡμῶν
38 ταῦτά μοι εἴκοσι ἔτη ἐγώ εἰμι μετὰ σοῦ τὰ πρόβατά σου καὶ αἱ αἶγές σου οὐκ ἠτεκνώθησαν κριοὺς τῶν προβάτων σου οὐ κατέφαγον
39 θηριάλωτον οὐκ ἀνενήνοχά σοι ἐγὼ ἀπετίννυον πα{R'} ἐμαυτοῦ κλέμματα ἡμέρας καὶ κλέμματα νυκτός
40 ἐγινόμην τῆς ἡμέρας συγκαιόμενος τῷ καύματι καὶ παγετῷ τῆς νυκτός καὶ ἀφίστατο ὁ ὕπνος ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου
41 ταῦτά μοι εἴκοσι ἔτη ἐγώ εἰμι ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ σου ἐδούλευσά σοι δέκα τέσσαρα ἔτη ἀντὶ τῶν δύο θυγατέρων σου καὶ ἓξ ἔτη ἐν τοῖς προβάτοις σου καὶ παρελογίσω τὸν μισθόν μου δέκα ἀμνάσιν
42 εἰ μὴ ὁ θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου Αβρααμ καὶ ὁ φόβος Ισαακ ἦν μοι νῦν ἂν κενόν με ἐξαπέστειλας τὴν ταπείνωσίν μου καὶ τὸν κόπον τῶν χειρῶν μου εἶδεν ὁ θεὸς καὶ ἤλεγξέν σε ἐχθές
43 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Λαβαν εἶπεν τῷ Ιακωβ αἱ θυγατέρες θυγατέρες μου καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ υἱοί μου καὶ τὰ κτήνη κτήνη μου καὶ πάντα ὅσα σὺ ὁρᾷς ἐμά ἐστιν καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων μου τί ποιήσω ταύταις σήμερον ἢ τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῶν οἷς ἔτεκον
44 νῦν οὖν δεῦρο διαθώμεθα διαθήκην ἐγὼ καὶ σύ καὶ ἔσται εἰς μαρτύριον ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ἰδοὺ οὐθεὶς με{Q'} ἡμῶν ἐστιν ἰδὲ ὁ θεὸς μάρτυς ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ

45 λαβὼν δὲ Ιακωβ λίθον ἔστησεν αὐτὸν στήλην
46 εἶπεν δὲ Ιακωβ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ συλλέγετε λίθους καὶ συνέλεξαν λίθους καὶ ἐποίησαν βουνόν καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἔπιον ἐκεῖ ἐπὶ τοῦ βουνοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Λαβαν ὁ βουνὸς οὗτος μαρτυρεῖ ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ σήμερον
47 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν Λαβαν Βουνὸς τῆς μαρτυρίας Ιακωβ δὲ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν Βουνὸς μάρτυς
48 εἶπεν δὲ Λαβαν τῷ Ιακωβ ἰδοὺ ὁ βουνὸς οὗτος καὶ ἡ στήλη αὕτη ἣν ἔστησα ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ μαρτυρεῖ ὁ βουνὸς οὗτος καὶ μαρτυρεῖ ἡ στήλη αὕτη διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Βουνὸς μαρτυρεῖ
49 καὶ ἡ ὅρασις ἣν εἶπεν ἐπίδοι ὁ θεὸς ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ ὅτι ἀποστησόμεθα ἕτερος ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑτέρου
50 εἰ ταπεινώσεις τὰς θυγατέρας μου εἰ λήμψῃ γυναῖκας ἐπὶ ταῖς θυγατράσιν μου ὅρα οὐθεὶς με{Q'} ἡμῶν ἐστιν
51 
52 ἐάν τε γὰρ ἐγὼ μὴ διαβῶ πρὸς σὲ μηδὲ σὺ διαβῇς πρός με τὸν βουνὸν τοῦτον καὶ τὴν στήλην ταύτην ἐπὶ κακίᾳ
53 ὁ θεὸς Αβρααμ καὶ ὁ θεὸς Ναχωρ κρινεῖ ἀνὰ μέσον ἡμῶν καὶ ὤμοσεν Ιακωβ κατὰ τοῦ φόβου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Ισαακ
54 καὶ ἔθυσεν Ιακωβ θυσίαν ἐν τῷ ὄρει καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἔπιον καὶ ἐκοιμήθησαν ἐν τῷ ὄρει
55 ἀναστὰς δὲ Λαβαν τὸ πρωὶ κατεφίλησεν τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτούς καὶ ἀποστραφεὶς Λαβαν ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ
