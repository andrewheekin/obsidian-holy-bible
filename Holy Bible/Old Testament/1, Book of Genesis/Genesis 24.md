# Book of Genesis 24 (RSVCE)

### The Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah
1 Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years; and theLordhad blessed Abraham in all things.
2 And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh,
3 and I will make you swear by theLord, the God of heaven and of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell,
4 but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”
5 The servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land; must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?”
6 Abraham said to him, “See to it that you do not take my son back there.
7 TheLord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and swore to me, ‘To your descendants I will give this land,’ he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
8 But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.”
9 So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
10 Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose, and went to Mesopotaʹmia, to the city of Nahor.
11 And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water.
12 And he said, “OLord, God of my master Abraham, grant me success today, I pray thee, and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.
13 Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
14 Let the maiden to whom I shall say, ‘Pray let down your jar that I may drink,’ and who shall say, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels’—let her be the one whom thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac. By this I shall know that thou hast shown steadfast love to my master.”
15 Before he had done speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuʹel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, came out with her water jar upon her shoulder.
16 The maiden was very fair to look upon, a virgin, whom no man had known. She went down to the spring, and filled her jar, and came up.
17 Then the servant ran to meet her, and said, “Pray give me a little water to drink from your jar.”
18 She said, “Drink, my lord”; and she quickly let down her jar upon her hand, and gave him a drink.
19 When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw for your camels also, until they have done drinking.”
20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.
21 The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether theLordhad prospered his journey or not.
22 When the camels had done drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,
23 and said, “Tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge in?”
24 She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuʹel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”
25 She added, “We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.”
26 The man bowed his head and worshiped theLord,
27 and said, “Blessed be theLord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, theLordhas led me in the way to the house of my master’s kinsmen.”
28 Then the maiden ran and told her mother’s household about these things.
29 Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.
30 When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, “Thus the man spoke to me,” he went to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
31 He said, “Come in, O blessed of theLord; why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”
32 So the man came into the house; and Laban ungirded the camels, and gave him straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
33 Then food was set before him to eat; but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my errand.” He said, “Speak on.”
34 So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.
35 TheLordhas greatly blessed my master, and he has become great; he has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, camels and asses.
36 And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and to him he has given all that he has.
37 My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell;
38 but you shall go to my father’s house and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.’
39 I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’
40 But he said to me, ‘TheLord, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father’s house;
41 then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my kindred; and if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.’
42 “I came today to the spring, and said, ‘OLord, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou wilt prosper the way which I go,
43 behold, I am standing by the spring of water; let the young woman who comes out to draw, to whom I shall say, “Pray give me a little water from your jar to drink,”
44 and who will say to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,” let her be the woman whom theLordhas appointed for my master’s son.’
45 “Before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder; and she went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Pray let me drink.’
46 She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.’ So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also.
47 Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuʹel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her arms.
48 Then I bowed my head and worshiped theLord, and blessed theLord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to take the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son.
49 Now then, if you will deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.”
50 Then Laban and Bethuʹel answered, “The thing comes from theLord; we cannot speak to you bad or good.
51 Behold, Rebekah is before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as theLordhas spoken.”
52 When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before theLord.
53 And the servant brought forth jewelry of silver and of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.
54 And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, “Send me back to my master.”
55 Her brother and her mother said, “Let the maiden remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.”
56 But he said to them, “Do not delay me, since theLordhas prospered my way; let me go that I may go to my master.”
57 They said, “We will call the maiden, and ask her.”
58 And they called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.”
59 So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant and his men.
60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister, be the mother of thousands of ten thousands; and may your descendants possess the gate of those who hate them!”
61 Then Rebekah and her maids arose, and rode upon the camels and followed the man; thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
62 Now Isaac had come from Beer-laʹhai-roi, and was dwelling in the Negeb.
63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there were camels coming.
64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel,
65 and said to the servant, “Who is the man yonder, walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself.
66 And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
67 Then Isaac brought her into the tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.


# Liber Genesis 24 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Erat autem Abraham senex, dierumque multorum: et Dominus in cunctis benedixerat ei.
2 Dixitque ad servum seniorem domus suæ, qui præerat omnibus quæ habebat: Pone manum tuam subter femur meum,
3 ut adjurem te per Dominum Deum cæli et terræ, ut non accipias uxorem filio meo de filiabus Chananæorum, inter quos habito:
4 sed ad terram et cognationem meam proficiscaris et inde accipias uxorem filio meo Isaac.
5 Respondit servus: Si noluerit mulier venire mecum in terram hanc, numquid reducere debeo filium tuum ad locum, de quo egressus es?
6 Dixitque Abraham: Cave nequando reducas filium meum illuc.
7 Dominus Deus cæli, qui tulit me de domo patris mei, et de terra nativitatis meæ, qui locutus est mihi, et juravit mihi, dicens: Semini tuo dabo terram hanc: ipse mittet angelum suum coram te, et accipies inde uxorem filio meo:
8 sin autem mulier noluerit sequi te, non teneberis juramento: filium meum tantum ne reducas illuc.

9 Posuit ergo servus manum sub femore Abraham domini sui, et juravit illi super sermone hoc.
10 Tulitque decem camelos de grege domini sui, et abiit, ex omnibus bonis ejus portans secum, profectusque perrexit in Mesopotamiam ad urbem Nachor.
11 Cumque camelos fecisset accumbere extra oppidum juxta puteum aquæ vespere, tempore quo solent mulieres egredi ad hauriendam aquam, dixit:
12 Domine Deus domini mei Abraham, occurre, obsecro, mihi hodie, et fac misericordiam cum domino meo Abraham.
13 Ecce ego sto prope fontem aquæ, et filiæ habitatorum hujus civitatis egredientur ad hauriendam aquam.
14 Igitur puella, cui ego dixero: Inclina hydriam tuam ut bibam: et illa responderit: Bibe, quin et camelis tuis dabo potum: ipsa est quam præparasti servo tuo Isaac: et per hoc intelligam quod feceris misericordiam cum domino meo.

15 Necdum intra se verba compleverat, et ecce Rebecca egrediebatur, filia Bathuel, filii Melchæ uxoris Nachor fratris Abraham, habens hydriam in scapula sua:
16 puella decora nimis, virgoque pulcherrima, et incognita viro: descenderat autem ad fontem, et impleverat hydriam, ac revertebatur.
17 Occurritque ei servus, et ait: Pauxillum aquæ mihi ad bibendum præbe de hydria tua.
18 Quæ respondit: Bibe, domine mi: celeriterque deposuit hydriam super ulnam suam, et dedit ei potum.
19 Cumque ille bibisset, adjecit: Quin et camelis tuis hauriam aquam, donec cuncti bibant.
20 Effundensque hydriam in canalibus, recurrit ad puteum ut hauriret aquam: et haustam omnibus camelis dedit.
21 Ipse autem contemplabatur eam tacitus, scire volens utrum prosperum iter suum fecisset Dominus, an non.
22 Postquam autem biberunt cameli, protulit vir inaures aureas, appendentes siclos duos, et armillas totidem pondo siclorum decem.
23 Dixitque ad eam: Cujus es filia? indica mihi, est in domo patris tui locus ad manendum?
24 Quæ respondit: Filia sum Bathuelis, filii Melchæ, quem peperit ipsi Nachor.
25 Et addidit, dicens: Palearum quoque et fœni plurimum est apud nos, et locus spatiosus ad manendum.

26 Inclinavit se homo, et adoravit Dominum,
27 dicens: Benedictus Dominus Deus domini mei Abraham, qui non abstulit misericordiam et veritatem suam a domino meo, et recto itinere me perduxit in domum fratris domini mei.
28 Cucurrit itaque puella, et nuntiavit in domum matris suæ omnia quæ audierat.
29 Habebat autem Rebecca fratrem nomine Laban, qui festinus egressus est ad hominem, ubi erat fons.
30 Cumque vidisset inaures et armillas in manibus sororis suæ, et audisset cuncta verba referentis: Hæc locutus est mihi homo: venit ad virum qui stabat juxta camelos, et prope fontem aquæ:
31 dixitque ad eum: Ingredere, benedicte Domini: cur foris stas? præparavi domum, et locum camelis.
32 Et introduxit eum in hospitium: ac destravit camelos, deditque paleas et fœnum, et aquam ad lavandos pedes ejus, et virorum qui venerant cum eo.

33 Et appositus est in conspectu ejus panis. Qui ait: Non comedam, donec loquar sermones meos. Respondit ei: Loquere.
34 At ille: Servus, inquit, Abraham sum:
35 et Dominus benedixit domino meo valde, magnificatusque est: et dedit ei oves et boves, argentum et aurum, servos et ancillas, camelos et asinos.
36 Et peperit Sara uxor domini mei filium domino meo in senectute sua, deditque illi omnia quæ habuerat.
37 Et adjuravit me dominus meus, dicens: Non accipies uxorem filio meo de filiabus Chananæorum, in quorum terra habito:
38 sed ad domum patris mei perges, et de cognatione mea accipies uxorem filio meo.
39 Ego vero respondi domino meo: Quid si noluerit venire mecum mulier?
40 Dominus, ait, in cujus conspectu ambulo, mittet angelum suum tecum, et diriget viam tuam: accipiesque uxorem filio meo de cognatione mea, et de domo patris mei.
41 Innocens eris a maledictione mea, cum veneris ad propinquos meos, et non dederint tibi.

42 Veni ergo hodie ad fontem aquæ, et dixi: Domine Deus domini mei Abraham, si direxisti viam meam, in qua nunc ambulo,
43 ecce sto juxta fontem aquæ, et virgo, quæ egredietur ad hauriendam aquam, audierit a me: Da mihi pauxillum aquæ ad bibendum ex hydria tua:
44 et dixerit mihi: Et tu bibe, et camelis tuis hauriam: ipsa est mulier, quam præparavit Dominus filio domini mei.
45 Dumque hæc tacitus mecum volverem, apparuit Rebecca veniens cum hydria, quam portabat in scapula: descenditque ad fontem, et hausit aquam. Et aio ad eam: Da mihi paululum bibere.
46 Quæ festinans deposuit hydriam de humero, et dixit mihi: Et tu bibe, et camelis tuis tribuam potum. Bibi, et adaquavit camelos.
47 Interrogavique eam, et dixi: Cujus es filia? Quæ respondit: Filia Bathuelis sum, filii Nachor, quem peperit ei Melcha. Suspendi itaque inaures ad ornandam faciem ejus, et armillas posui in manibus ejus.
48 Pronusque adoravi Dominum, benedicens Domino Deo domini mei Abraham, qui perduxit me recto itinere, ut sumerem filiam fratris domini mei filio ejus.
49 Quam ob rem si facitis misericordiam et veritatem cum domino meo, indicate mihi: sin autem aliud placet, et hoc dicite mihi, ut vadam ad dextram, sive ad sinistram.

50 Responderuntque Laban et Bathuel: A Domino egressus est sermo: non possumus extra placitum ejus quidquam aliud loqui tecum.
51 En Rebecca coram te est, tolle eam, et proficiscere, et sit uxor filii domini tui, sicut locutus est Dominus.
52 Quod cum audisset puer Abraham, procidens adoravit in terram Dominum.
53 Prolatisque vasis argenteis, et aureis, ac vestibus, dedit ea Rebeccæ pro munere: fratribus quoque ejus et matri dona obtulit.
54 Inito convivio, vescentes pariter et bibentes manserunt ibi. Surgens autem mane, locutus est puer: Dimitte me, ut vadam ad dominum meum.
55 Responderuntque fratres ejus et mater: Maneat puella saltem decem dies apud nos, et postea proficiscetur.
56 Nolite, ait, me retinere, quia Dominus direxit viam meam: dimittite me ut pergam ad dominum meum.
57 Et dixerunt: Vocemus puellam, et quæramus ipsius voluntatem.
58 Cumque vocata venisset, sciscitati sunt: Vis ire cum homine isto? Quæ ait: Vadam.
59 Dimiserunt ergo eam, et nutricem illius, servumque Abraham, et comites ejus,
60 imprecantes prospera sorori suæ, atque dicentes: Soror nostra es, crescas in mille millia, et possideat semen tuum portas inimicorum suorum.

61 Igitur Rebecca et puellæ illius, ascensis camelis, secutæ sunt virum: qui festinus revertebatur ad dominum suum.
62 Eo autem tempore deambulabat Isaac per viam quæ ducit ad puteum, cujus nomen est Viventis et videntis: habitabat enim in terra australi:
63 et egressus fuerat ad meditandum in agro, inclinata jam die: cumque elevasset oculos, vidit camelos venientes procul.
64 Rebecca quoque, conspecto Isaac, descendit de camelo,
65 et ait ad puerum: Quis est ille homo qui venit per agrum in occursum nobis? Dixitque ei: Ipse est dominus meus. At illa tollens cito pallium, operuit se.
66 Servus autem cuncta, quæ gesserat, narravit Isaac.
67 Qui introduxit eam in tabernaculum Saræ matris suæ, et accepit eam uxorem: et in tantum dilexit eam, ut dolorem, qui ex morte matris ejus acciderat, temperaret.


# Γένεσις 24 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ Αβρααμ ἦν πρεσβύτερος προβεβηκὼς ἡμερῶν καὶ κύριος εὐλόγησεν τὸν Αβρααμ κατὰ πάντα
2 καὶ εἶπεν Αβρααμ τῷ παιδὶ αὐτοῦ τῷ πρεσβυτέρῳ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ τῷ ἄρχοντι πάντων τῶν αὐτοῦ θὲς τὴν χεῖρά σου ὑπὸ τὸν μηρόν μου
3 καὶ ἐξορκιῶ σε κύριον τὸν θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τὸν θεὸν τῆς γῆς ἵνα μὴ λάβῃς γυναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ μου Ισαακ ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν Χαναναίων με{Q'} ὧν ἐγὼ οἰκῶ ἐν αὐτοῖς
4 ἀλλὰ εἰς τὴν γῆν μου οὗ ἐγενόμην πορεύσῃ καὶ εἰς τὴν φυλήν μου καὶ λήμψῃ γυναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ μου Ισαακ ἐκεῖθεν
5 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ παῖς μήποτε οὐ βούλεται ἡ γυνὴ πορευθῆναι με{T'} ἐμοῦ ὀπίσω εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην ἀποστρέψω τὸν υἱόν σου εἰς τὴν γῆν ὅθεν ἐξῆλθες ἐκεῖθεν
6 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν Αβρααμ πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς τὸν υἱόν μου ἐκεῖ
7 κύριος ὁ θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ὁ θεὸς τῆς γῆς ὃς ἔλαβέν με ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός μου καὶ ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἧς ἐγενήθην ὃς ἐλάλησέν μοι καὶ ὤμοσέν μοι λέγων σοὶ δώσω τὴν γῆν ταύτην καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου αὐτὸς ἀποστελεῖ τὸν ἄγγελον αὐτοῦ ἔμπροσθέν σου καὶ λήμψῃ γυναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ μου Ισαακ ἐκεῖθεν
8 ἐὰν δὲ μὴ θέλῃ ἡ γυνὴ πορευθῆναι μετὰ σοῦ εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην καθαρὸς ἔσῃ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὅρκου τούτου μόνον τὸν υἱόν μου μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς ἐκεῖ

9 καὶ ἔθηκεν ὁ παῖς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ὑπὸ τὸν μηρὸν Αβρααμ τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ περὶ τοῦ ῥήματος τούτου
10 καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ παῖς δέκα καμήλους ἀπὸ τῶν καμήλων τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἀγαθῶν τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ με{Q'} ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἀναστὰς ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν εἰς τὴν πόλιν Ναχωρ
11 καὶ ἐκοίμισεν τὰς καμήλους ἔξω τῆς πόλεως παρὰ τὸ φρέαρ τοῦ ὕδατος τὸ πρὸς ὀψέ ἡνίκα ἐκπορεύονται αἱ ὑδρευόμεναι
12 καὶ εἶπεν κύριε ὁ θεὸς τοῦ κυρίου μου Αβρααμ εὐόδωσον ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ σήμερον καὶ ποίησον ἔλεος μετὰ τοῦ κυρίου μου Αβρααμ
13 ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἕστηκα ἐπὶ τῆς πηγῆς τοῦ ὕδατος αἱ δὲ θυγατέρες τῶν οἰκούντων τὴν πόλιν ἐκπορεύονται ἀντλῆσαι ὕδωρ

15 καὶ ἐγένετο πρὸ τοῦ συντελέσαι αὐτὸν λαλοῦντα ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ καὶ ἰδοὺ Ρεβεκκα ἐξεπορεύετο ἡ τεχθεῖσα Βαθουηλ υἱῷ Μελχας τῆς γυναικὸς Ναχωρ ἀδελφοῦ δὲ Αβρααμ ἔχουσα τὴν ὑδρίαν ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων αὐτῆς
16 ἡ δὲ παρθένος ἦν καλὴ τῇ ὄψει σφόδρα παρθένος ἦν ἀνὴρ οὐκ ἔγνω αὐτήν καταβᾶσα δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν πηγὴν ἔπλησεν τὴν ὑδρίαν καὶ ἀνέβη
17 ἐπέδραμεν δὲ ὁ παῖς εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῆς καὶ εἶπεν πότισόν με μικρὸν ὕδωρ ἐκ τῆς ὑδρίας σου
18 ἡ δὲ εἶπεν πίε κύριε καὶ ἔσπευσεν καὶ καθεῖλεν τὴν ὑδρίαν ἐπὶ τὸν βραχίονα αὐτῆς καὶ ἐπότισεν αὐτόν
19 ἕως ἐπαύσατο πίνων καὶ εἶπεν καὶ ταῖς καμήλοις σου ὑδρεύσομαι ἕως ἂν πᾶσαι πίωσιν
20 καὶ ἔσπευσεν καὶ ἐξεκένωσεν τὴν ὑδρίαν εἰς τὸ ποτιστήριον καὶ ἔδραμεν ἔτι ἐπὶ τὸ φρέαρ ἀντλῆσαι καὶ ὑδρεύσατο πάσαις ταῖς καμήλοις
21 ὁ δὲ ἄνθρωπος κατεμάνθανεν αὐτὴν καὶ παρεσιώπα τοῦ γνῶναι εἰ εὐόδωκεν κύριος τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ ἢ οὔ
22 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἐπαύσαντο πᾶσαι αἱ κάμηλοι πίνουσαι ἔλαβεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐνώτια χρυσᾶ ἀνὰ δραχμὴν ὁλκῆς καὶ δύο ψέλια ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς δέκα χρυσῶν ὁλκὴ αὐτῶν
23 καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτὴν καὶ εἶπεν θυγάτηρ τίνος εἶ ἀνάγγειλόν μοι εἰ ἔστιν παρὰ τῷ πατρί σου τόπος ἡμῖν καταλῦσαι
24 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ θυγάτηρ Βαθουηλ εἰμὶ ἐγὼ τοῦ Μελχας ὃν ἔτεκεν τῷ Ναχωρ
25 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ καὶ ἄχυρα καὶ χορτάσματα πολλὰ πα{R'} ἡμῖν καὶ τόπος τοῦ καταλῦσαι

32 εἰσῆλθεν δὲ ὁ ἄνθρωπος εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ ἀπέσαξεν τὰς καμήλους καὶ ἔδωκεν ἄχυρα καὶ χορτάσματα ταῖς καμήλοις καὶ ὕδωρ νίψασθαι τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῖς ποσὶν τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν με{T'} αὐτοῦ

33 καὶ παρέθηκεν αὐτοῖς ἄρτους φαγεῖν καὶ εἶπεν οὐ μὴ φάγω ἕως τοῦ λαλῆσαί με τὰ ῥήματά μου καὶ εἶπαν λάλησον
34 καὶ εἶπεν παῖς Αβρααμ ἐγώ εἰμι
35 κύριος δὲ εὐλόγησεν τὸν κύριόν μου σφόδρα καὶ ὑψώθη καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ πρόβατα καὶ μόσχους ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον παῖδας καὶ παιδίσκας καμήλους καὶ ὄνους
36 καὶ ἔτεκεν Σαρρα ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ κυρίου μου υἱὸν ἕνα τῷ κυρίῳ μου μετὰ τὸ γηρᾶσαι αὐτόν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὅσα ἦν αὐτῷ
37 καὶ ὥρκισέν με ὁ κύριός μου λέγων οὐ λήμψῃ γυναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ μου ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν Χαναναίων ἐν οἷς ἐγὼ παροικῶ ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν
38 ἀλ{L'} ἢ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου πορεύσῃ καὶ εἰς τὴν φυλήν μου καὶ λήμψῃ γυναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ μου ἐκεῖθεν
39 εἶπα δὲ τῷ κυρίῳ μου μήποτε οὐ πορεύσεται ἡ γυνὴ με{T'} ἐμοῦ
40 καὶ εἶπέν μοι κύριος ᾧ εὐηρέστησα ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ αὐτὸς ἀποστελεῖ τὸν ἄγγελον αὐτοῦ μετὰ σοῦ καὶ εὐοδώσει τὴν ὁδόν σου καὶ λήμψῃ γυναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ μου ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς μου καὶ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός μου
41 τότε ἀθῷος ἔσῃ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρᾶς μου ἡνίκα γὰρ ἐὰν ἔλθῃς εἰς τὴν ἐμὴν φυλὴν καὶ μή σοι δῶσιν καὶ ἔσῃ ἀθῷος ἀπὸ τοῦ ὁρκισμοῦ μου

42 καὶ ἐλθὼν σήμερον ἐπὶ τὴν πηγὴν εἶπα κύριε ὁ θεὸς τοῦ κυρίου μου Αβρααμ εἰ σὺ εὐοδοῖς τὴν ὁδόν μου ἣν νῦν ἐγὼ πορεύομαι ἐ{P'} αὐτήν
43 ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐφέστηκα ἐπὶ τῆς πηγῆς τοῦ ὕδατος καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῆς πόλεως ἐξελεύσονται ὑδρεύσασθαι ὕδωρ καὶ ἔσται ἡ παρθένος ᾗ ἂν ἐγὼ εἴπω πότισόν με μικρὸν ὕδωρ ἐκ τῆς ὑδρίας σου
44 καὶ εἴπῃ μοι καὶ σὺ πίε καὶ ταῖς καμήλοις σου ὑδρεύσομαι αὕτη ἡ γυνή ἣν ἡτοίμασεν κύριος τῷ ἑαυτοῦ θεράποντι Ισαακ καὶ ἐν τούτῳ γνώσομαι ὅτι πεποίηκας ἔλεος τῷ κυρίῳ μου Αβρααμ
45 καὶ ἐγένετο πρὸ τοῦ συντελέσαι με λαλοῦντα ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ εὐθὺς Ρεβεκκα ἐξεπορεύετο ἔχουσα τὴν ὑδρίαν ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων καὶ κατέβη ἐπὶ τὴν πηγὴν καὶ ὑδρεύσατο εἶπα δὲ αὐτῇ πότισόν με
46 καὶ σπεύσασα καθεῖλεν τὴν ὑδρίαν αὐτῆς ἀ{F'} ἑαυτῆς καὶ εἶπεν πίε σύ καὶ τὰς καμήλους σου ποτιῶ καὶ ἔπιον καὶ τὰς καμήλους μου ἐπότισεν
47 καὶ ἠρώτησα αὐτὴν καὶ εἶπα τίνος εἶ θυγάτηρ ἡ δὲ ἔφη θυγάτηρ Βαθουηλ εἰμὶ τοῦ υἱοῦ Ναχωρ ὃν ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ Μελχα καὶ περιέθηκα αὐτῇ τὰ ἐνώτια καὶ τὰ ψέλια περὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς
48 καὶ εὐδοκήσας προσεκύνησα κυρίῳ καὶ εὐλόγησα κύριον τὸν θεὸν τοῦ κυρίου μου Αβρααμ ὃς εὐόδωσέν μοι ἐν ὁδῷ ἀληθείας λαβεῖν τὴν θυγατέρα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τοῦ κυρίου μου τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ
49 εἰ οὖν ποιεῖτε ὑμεῖς ἔλεος καὶ δικαιοσύνην πρὸς τὸν κύριόν μου ἀπαγγείλατέ μοι εἰ δὲ μή ἀπαγγείλατέ μοι ἵνα ἐπιστρέψω εἰς δεξιὰν ἢ εἰς ἀριστεράν

50 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Λαβαν καὶ Βαθουηλ εἶπαν παρὰ κυρίου ἐξῆλθεν τὸ πρόσταγμα τοῦτο οὐ δυνησόμεθα οὖν σοι ἀντειπεῖν κακὸν καλῷ
51 ἰδοὺ Ρεβεκκα ἐνώπιόν σου λαβὼν ἀπότρεχε καὶ ἔστω γυνὴ τῷ υἱῷ τοῦ κυρίου σου καθὰ ἐλάλησεν κύριος
52 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι τὸν παῖδα τὸν Αβρααμ τῶν ῥημάτων τούτων προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν κυρίῳ
53 καὶ ἐξενέγκας ὁ παῖς σκεύη ἀργυρᾶ καὶ χρυσᾶ καὶ ἱματισμὸν ἔδωκεν Ρεβεκκα καὶ δῶρα ἔδωκεν τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτῆς καὶ τῇ μητρὶ αὐτῆς
54 καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἔπιον αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ὄντες καὶ ἐκοιμήθησαν καὶ ἀναστὰς πρωὶ εἶπεν ἐκπέμψατέ με ἵνα ἀπέλθω πρὸς τὸν κύριόν μου
55 εἶπαν δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῆς καὶ ἡ μήτηρ μεινάτω ἡ παρθένος με{Q'} ἡμῶν ἡμέρας ὡσεὶ δέκα καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπελεύσεται
56 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς μὴ κατέχετέ με καὶ κύριος εὐόδωσεν τὴν ὁδόν μου ἐκπέμψατέ με ἵνα ἀπέλθω πρὸς τὸν κύριόν μου
57 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν καλέσωμεν τὴν παῖδα καὶ ἐρωτήσωμεν τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς
58 καὶ ἐκάλεσαν Ρεβεκκαν καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ πορεύσῃ μετὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τούτου ἡ δὲ εἶπεν πορεύσομαι
59 καὶ ἐξέπεμψαν Ρεβεκκαν τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῆς καὶ τὸν παῖδα τὸν Αβρααμ καὶ τοὺς με{T'} αὐτοῦ
60 καὶ εὐλόγησαν Ρεβεκκαν τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ ἀδελφὴ ἡμῶν εἶ γίνου εἰς χιλιάδας μυριάδων καὶ κληρονομησάτω τὸ σπέρμα σου τὰς πόλεις τῶν ὑπεναντίων

61 ἀναστᾶσα δὲ Ρεβεκκα καὶ αἱ ἅβραι αὐτῆς ἐπέβησαν ἐπὶ τὰς καμήλους καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν μετὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου καὶ ἀναλαβὼν ὁ παῖς τὴν Ρεβεκκαν ἀπῆλθεν
62 Ισαακ δὲ ἐπορεύετο διὰ τῆς ἐρήμου κατὰ τὸ φρέαρ τῆς ὁράσεως αὐτὸς δὲ κατῴκει ἐν τῇ γῇ τῇ πρὸς λίβα
63 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ισαακ ἀδολεσχῆσαι εἰς τὸ πεδίον τὸ πρὸς δείλης καὶ ἀναβλέψας τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς εἶδεν καμήλους ἐρχομένας
64 καὶ ἀναβλέψασα Ρεβεκκα τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς εἶδεν τὸν Ισαακ καὶ κατεπήδησεν ἀπὸ τῆς καμήλου
65 καὶ εἶπεν τῷ παιδί τίς ἐστιν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος ὁ πορευόμενος ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ εἰς συνάντησιν ἡμῖν εἶπεν δὲ ὁ παῖς οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ κύριός μου ἡ δὲ λαβοῦσα τὸ θέριστρον περιεβάλετο
66 καὶ διηγήσατο ὁ παῖς τῷ Ισαακ πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ἃ ἐποίησεν
67 εἰσῆλθεν δὲ Ισαακ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβεν τὴν Ρεβεκκαν καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῦ γυνή καὶ ἠγάπησεν αὐτήν καὶ παρεκλήθη Ισαακ περὶ Σαρρας τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ
