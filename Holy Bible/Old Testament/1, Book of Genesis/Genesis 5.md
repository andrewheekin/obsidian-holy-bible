# Book of Genesis 5 (RSVCE)

### Adam’s Descendants to Noah and His Sons
1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.
2 Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created.
3 When Adam had lived a hundred and thirty years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.
4 The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years; and he had other sons and daughters.
5 Thus all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.
6 When Seth had lived a hundred and five years, he became the father of Enosh.
7 Seth lived after the birth of Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
8 Thus all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
9 When Enosh had lived ninety years, he became the father of Kenan.
10 Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
11 Thus all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
12 When Kenan had lived seventy years, he became the father of Mahalʹalel.
13 Kenan lived after the birth of Mahalʹalel eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters.
14 Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
15 When Mahalʹalel had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared.
16 Mahalʹalel lived after the birth of Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
17 Thus all the days of Mahalʹalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years; and he died.
18 When Jared had lived a hundred and sixty-two years he became the father of Enoch.
19 Jared lived after the birth of Enoch eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
20 Thus all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he died.
21 When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuʹselah.
22 Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuʹselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
23 Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
24 Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.
25 When Methuʹselah had lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech.
26 Methuʹselah lived after the birth of Lamech seven hundred and eighty-two years, and had other sons and daughters.
27 Thus all the days of Methuʹselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years; and he died.
28 When Lamech had lived a hundred and eighty-two years, he became the father of a son,
29 and called his name Noah, saying, “Out of the ground which theLordhas cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands.”
30 Lamech lived after the birth of Noah five hundred and ninety-five years, and had other sons and daughters.
31 Thus all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years; and he died.
32 After Noah was five hundred years old, Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.


# Liber Genesis 5 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Hic est liber generationis Adam. In die qua creavit Deus hominem, ad similitudinem Dei fecit illum.
2 Masculum et feminam creavit eos, et benedixit illis: et vocavit nomen eorum Adam, in die quo creati sunt.
3 Vixit autem Adam centum triginta annis: et genuit ad imaginem et similitudinem suam, vocavitque nomen ejus Seth.
4 Et facti sunt dies Adam, postquam genuit Seth, octingenti anni: genuitque filios et filias.
5 Et factum est omne tempus quod vixit Adam, anni nongenti triginta, et mortuus est.
6 Vixit quoque Seth centum quinque annis, et genuit Enos.
8 Vixitque Seth, postquam genuit Enos, octingentis septem annis, genuitque filios et filias.
9 Et facti sunt omnes dies Seth nongentorum duodecim annorum, et mortuus est.
11 Vixit vero Enos nonaginta annis, et genuit Cainan.
12 Post cujus ortum vixit octingentis quindecim annis, et genuit filios et filias.
14 Factique sunt omnes dies Enos nongenti quinque anni, et mortuus est.
15 Vixit quoque Cainan septuaginta annis, et genuit Malaleel.
17 Et vixit Cainan, postquam genuit Malaleel, octingentis quadraginta annis, genuitque filios et filias.
18 Et facti sunt omnes dies Cainan nongenti decem anni, et mortuus est.
20 Vixit autem Malaleel sexaginta quinque annis, et genuit Jared.

21 Porro Henoch vixit sexaginta quinque annis, et genuit Mathusalam.
22 Et ambulavit Henoch cum Deo: et vixit, postquam genuit Mathusalam, trecentis annis, et genuit filios et filias.
23 Et facti sunt omnes dies Henoch trecenti sexaginta quinque anni.
24 Ambulavitque cum Deo, et non apparuit: quia tulit eum Deus.
25 Vixit quoque Mathusala centum octoginta septem annis, et genuit Lamech.
26 Et vixit Mathusala, postquam genuit Lamech, septingentis octoginta duobus annis, et genuit filios et filias.
27 Et facti sunt omnes dies Mathusala nongenti sexaginta novem anni, et mortuus est.
28 Vixit autem Lamech centum octoginta duobus annis, et genuit filium:
29 vocavitque nomen ejus Noë, dicens: Iste consolabitur nos ab operibus et laboribus manuum nostrarum in terra, cui maledixit Dominus.
30 Vixitque Lamech, postquam genuit Noë, quingentis nonaginta quinque annis, et genuit filios et filias.
31 Et facti sunt omnes dies Lamech septingenti septuaginta septem anni, et mortuus est.
32 Noë vero cum quingentorum esset annorum, genuit Sem, Cham et Japheth.
