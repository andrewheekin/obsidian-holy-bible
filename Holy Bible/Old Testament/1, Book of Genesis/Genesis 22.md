# Book of Genesis 22 (RSVCE)

### The Command to Sacrifice Isaac
1 After these things God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here am I.”
2 He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriʹah, and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”
3 So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; and he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off.
5 Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the ass; I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.”
6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.
7 And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here am I, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
8 Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together.
9 When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
10 Then Abraham put forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
11 But the angel of theLordcalled to him from heaven, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here am I.”
12 He said, “Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”
13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.
14 So Abraham called the name of that place TheLordwill provide; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of theLordit shall be provided.”
15 And the angel of theLordcalled to Abraham a second time from heaven,
16 and said, “By myself I have sworn, says theLord, because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son,
17 I will indeed bless you, and I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies,
18 and by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.”
19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
### The Children of Nahor
20 Now after these things it was told Abraham, “Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:
21 Uz the first-born, Buz his brother, Kemuʹel the father of Aram,
22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuʹel.”
23 Bethuʹel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
24 Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maʹacah.


# Liber Genesis 22 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Quæ postquam gesta sunt, tentavit Deus Abraham, et dixit ad eum: Abraham, Abraham. At ille respondit: Adsum.
2 Ait illi: Tolle filium tuum unigenitum, quem diligis, Isaac, et vade in terram visionis, atque ibi offeres eum in holocaustum super unum montium quem monstravero tibi.
3 Igitur Abraham de nocte consurgens, stravit asinum suum, ducens secum duos juvenes, et Isaac filium suum: cumque concidisset ligna in holocaustum, abiit ad locum quem præceperat ei Deus.
4 Die autem tertio, elevatis oculis, vidit locum procul:
5 dixitque ad pueros suos: Expectate hic cum asino: ego et puer illuc usque properantes, postquam adoraverimus, revertemur ad vos.
6 Tulit quoque ligna holocausti, et imposuit super Isaac filium suum: ipse vero portabat in manibus ignem et gladium. Cumque duo pergerent simul,
7 dixit Isaac patri suo: Pater mi. At ille respondit: Quid vis, fili? Ecce, inquit, ignis et ligna: ubi est victima holocausti?
8 Dixit autem Abraham: Deus providebit sibi victimam holocausti, fili mi. Pergebant ergo pariter.
9 Et venerunt ad locum quem ostenderat ei Deus, in quo ædificavit altare, et desuper ligna composuit; cumque alligasset Isaac filium suum, posuit eum in altare super struem lignorum.
10 Extenditque manum, et arripuit gladium, ut immolaret filium suum.

11 Et ecce angelus Domini de cælo clamavit, dicens: Abraham, Abraham. Qui respondit: Adsum.
12 Dixitque ei: Non extendas manum tuam super puerum, neque facias illi quidquam: nunc cognovi quod times Deum, et non pepercisti unigenito filio tuo propter me.
13 Levavit Abraham oculos suos, viditque post tergum arietem inter vepres hærentem cornibus, quem assumens obtulit holocaustum pro filio.
14 Appellavitque nomen loci illius, Dominus videt. Unde usque hodie dicitur: In monte Dominus videbit.

15 Vocavit autem angelus Domini Abraham secundo de cælo, dicens:
16 Per memetipsum juravi, dicit Dominus: quia fecisti hanc rem, et non pepercisti filio tuo unigenito propter me:
17 benedicam tibi, et multiplicabo semen tuum sicut stellas cæli, et velut arenam quæ est in littore maris: possidebit semen tuum portas inimicorum suorum,
18 et benedicentur in semine tuo omnes gentes terræ, quia obedisti voci meæ.
19 Reversus est Abraham ad pueros suos, abieruntque Bersabee simul, et habitavit ibi.

20 His ita gestis, nuntiatum est Abrahæ quod Melcha quoque genuisset filios Nachor fratri suo:
21 Hus primogenitum, et Buz fratrem ejus, et Camuel patrem Syrorum,
22 et Cased, et Azau, Pheldas quoque et Jedlaph,
23 ac Bathuel, de quo nata est Rebecca: octo istos genuit Melcha, Nachor fratri Abrahæ.
24 Concubina vero illius, nomine Roma, peperit Tabee, et Gaham, et Thahas, et Maacha.

1 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα ὁ θεὸς ἐπείραζεν τὸν Αβρααμ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν Αβρααμ Αβρααμ ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγώ
2 καὶ εἶπεν λαβὲ τὸν υἱόν σου τὸν ἀγαπητόν ὃν ἠγάπησας τὸν Ισαακ καὶ πορεύθητι εἰς τὴν γῆν τὴν ὑψηλὴν καὶ ἀνένεγκον αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ εἰς ὁλοκάρπωσιν ἐ{F'} ἓν τῶν ὀρέων ὧν ἄν σοι εἴπω
3 ἀναστὰς δὲ Αβρααμ τὸ πρωὶ ἐπέσαξεν τὴν ὄνον αὐτοῦ παρέλαβεν δὲ με{Q'} ἑαυτοῦ δύο παῖδας καὶ Ισαακ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ σχίσας ξύλα εἰς ὁλοκάρπωσιν ἀναστὰς ἐπορεύθη καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον ὃν εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ θεός
4 τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ καὶ ἀναβλέψας Αβρααμ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς εἶδεν τὸν τόπον μακρόθεν
5 καὶ εἶπεν Αβρααμ τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ καθίσατε αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῆς ὄνου ἐγὼ δὲ καὶ τὸ παιδάριον διελευσόμεθα ἕως ὧδε καὶ προσκυνήσαντες ἀναστρέψωμεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς
6 ἔλαβεν δὲ Αβρααμ τὰ ξύλα τῆς ὁλοκαρπώσεως καὶ ἐπέθηκεν Ισαακ τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ ἔλαβεν δὲ καὶ τὸ πῦρ μετὰ χεῖρα καὶ τὴν μάχαιραν καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ δύο ἅμα
7 εἶπεν δὲ Ισαακ πρὸς Αβρααμ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ εἴπας πάτερ ὁ δὲ εἶπεν τί ἐστιν τέκνον λέγων ἰδοὺ τὸ πῦρ καὶ τὰ ξύλα ποῦ ἐστιν τὸ πρόβατον τὸ εἰς ὁλοκάρπωσιν
8 εἶπεν δὲ Αβρααμ ὁ θεὸς ὄψεται ἑαυτῷ πρόβατον εἰς ὁλοκάρπωσιν τέκνον πορευθέντες δὲ ἀμφότεροι ἅμα
9 ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον ὃν εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ θεός καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ Αβρααμ θυσιαστήριον καὶ ἐπέθηκεν τὰ ξύλα καὶ συμποδίσας Ισαακ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπέθηκεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐπάνω τῶν ξύλων
10 καὶ ἐξέτεινεν Αβρααμ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ λαβεῖν τὴν μάχαιραν σφάξαι τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ

11 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν ἄγγελος κυρίου ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Αβρααμ Αβρααμ ὁ δὲ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐγώ
12 καὶ εἶπεν μὴ ἐπιβάλῃς τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐπὶ τὸ παιδάριον μηδὲ ποιήσῃς αὐτῷ μηδέν νῦν γὰρ ἔγνων ὅτι φοβῇ τὸν θεὸν σὺ καὶ οὐκ ἐφείσω τοῦ υἱοῦ σου τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ δ{I'} ἐμέ
13 καὶ ἀναβλέψας Αβρααμ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ εἶδεν καὶ ἰδοὺ κριὸς εἷς κατεχόμενος ἐν φυτῷ σαβεκ τῶν κεράτων καὶ ἐπορεύθη Αβρααμ καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸν κριὸν καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν αὐτὸν εἰς ὁλοκάρπωσιν ἀντὶ Ισαακ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Αβρααμ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου κύριος εἶδεν ἵνα εἴπωσιν σήμερον ἐν τῷ ὄρει κύριος ὤφθη

15 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ἄγγελος κυρίου τὸν Αβρααμ δεύτερον ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ
16 λέγων κα{T'} ἐμαυτοῦ ὤμοσα λέγει κύριος οὗ εἵνεκεν ἐποίησας τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο καὶ οὐκ ἐφείσω τοῦ υἱοῦ σου τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ δ{I'} ἐμέ
17 ἦ μὴν εὐλογῶν εὐλογήσω σε καὶ πληθύνων πληθυνῶ τὸ σπέρμα σου ὡς τοὺς ἀστέρας τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ὡς τὴν ἄμμον τὴν παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ κληρονομήσει τὸ σπέρμα σου τὰς πόλεις τῶν ὑπεναντίων
18 καὶ ἐνευλογηθήσονται ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς ἀν{Q'} ὧν ὑπήκουσας τῆς ἐμῆς φωνῆς
19 ἀπεστράφη δὲ Αβρααμ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀναστάντες ἐπορεύθησαν ἅμα ἐπὶ τὸ φρέαρ τοῦ ὅρκου καὶ κατῴκησεν Αβρααμ ἐπὶ τῷ φρέατι τοῦ ὅρκου

20 ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα καὶ ἀνηγγέλη τῷ Αβρααμ λέγοντες ἰδοὺ τέτοκεν Μελχα καὶ αὐτὴ υἱοὺς Ναχωρ τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου
21 τὸν Ωξ πρωτότοκον καὶ τὸν Βαυξ ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν Καμουηλ πατέρα Σύρων
22 καὶ τὸν Χασαδ καὶ τὸν Αζαυ καὶ τὸν Φαλδας καὶ τὸν Ιεδλαφ καὶ τὸν Βαθουηλ
23 καὶ Βαθουηλ ἐγέννησεν τὴν Ρεβεκκαν ὀκτὼ οὗτοι υἱοί οὓς ἔτεκεν Μελχα τῷ Ναχωρ τῷ ἀδελφῷ Αβρααμ
24 καὶ ἡ παλλακὴ αὐτοῦ ᾗ ὄνομα Ρεημα ἔτεκεν καὶ αὐτὴ τὸν Ταβεκ καὶ τὸν Γααμ καὶ τὸν Τοχος καὶ τὸν Μωχα
