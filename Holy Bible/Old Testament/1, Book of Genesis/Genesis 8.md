# Book of Genesis 8 (RSVCE)

### The Flood Subsides
1 But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided;
2 the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,
3 and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters had abated;
4 and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest upon the mountains of Arʹarat.
5 And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
6 At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made,
7 and sent forth a raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
8 Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground;
9 but the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put forth his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.
10 He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
11 and the dove came back to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
12 Then he waited another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she did not return to him any more.
13 In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.
14 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
15 Then God said to Noah,
16 “Go forth from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you.
17 Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh—birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth—that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.”
18 So Noah went forth, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him.
19 And every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves upon the earth, went forth by families out of the ark.
### God’s Promise to Noah
20 Then Noah built an altar to theLord, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
21 And when theLordsmelled the pleasing odor, theLordsaid in his heart, “I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.
22 While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.”


# Liber Genesis 8 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Recordatus autem Deus Noë, cunctorumque animantium, et omnium jumentorum, quæ erant cum eo in arca, adduxit spiritum super terram, et imminutæ sunt aquæ.
2 Et clausi sunt fontes abyssi, et cataractæ cæli: et prohibitæ sunt pluviæ de cælo.
3 Reversæque sunt aquæ de terra euntes et redeuntes: et cœperunt minui post centum quinquaginta dies.
4 Requievitque arca mense septimo, vigesimo septimo die mensis, super montes Armeniæ.
5 At vero aquæ ibant et decrescebant usque ad decimum mensem: decimo enim mense, primo die mensis, apparuerunt cacumina montium.
6 Cumque transissent quadraginta dies, aperiens Noë fenestram arcæ, quam fecerat, dimisit corvum,
7 qui egrediebatur, et non revertebatur, donec siccarentur aquæ super terram.
8 Emisit quoque columbam post eum, ut videret si jam cessassent aquæ super faciem terræ.
9 Quæ cum non invenisset ubi requiesceret pes ejus, reversa est ad eum in arcam: aquæ enim erant super universam terram: extenditque manum, et apprehensam intulit in arcam.
10 Expectatis autem ultra septem diebus aliis, rursum dimisit columbam ex arca.
11 At illa venit ad eum ad vesperam, portans ramum olivæ virentibus foliis in ore suo: intellexit ergo Noë quod cessassent aquæ super terram.
12 Expectavitque nihilominus septem alios dies: et emisit columbam, quæ non est reversa ultra ad eum.
13 Igitur sexcentesimo primo anno, primo mense, prima die mensis, imminutæ sunt aquæ super terram: et aperiens Noë tectum arcæ, aspexit, viditque quod exsiccata esset superficies terræ.
14 Mense secundo, septimo et vigesimo die mensis arefacta est terra.

15 Locutus est autem Deus ad Noë, dicens:
16 Egredere de arca, tu et uxor tua, filii tui et uxores filiorum tuorum tecum.
17 Cuncta animantia, quæ sunt apud te, ex omni carne, tam in volatilibus quam in bestiis et universis reptilibus, quæ reptant super terram, educ tecum, et ingredimini super terram: crescite et multiplicamini super eam.
18 Egressus est ergo Noë, et filii ejus: uxor illius, et uxores filiorum ejus cum eo.
19 Sed et omnia animantia, jumenta, et reptilia quæ reptant super terram, secundum genus suum, egressa sunt de arca.
20 Ædificavit autem Noë altare Domino: et tollens de cunctis pecoribus et volucribus mundis, obtulit holocausta super altare.
21 Odoratusque est Dominus odorem suavitatis, et ait: Nequaquam ultra maledicam terræ propter homines: sensus enim et cogitatio humani cordis in malum prona sunt ab adolescentia sua: non igitur ultra percutiam omnem animam viventem sicut feci.
22 Cunctis diebus terræ, sementis et messis, frigus et æstus, æstas et hiems, nox et dies non requiescent.


# Γένεσις 8 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐμνήσθη ὁ θεὸς τοῦ Νωε καὶ πάντων τῶν θηρίων καὶ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν καὶ πάντων τῶν πετεινῶν καὶ πάντων τῶν ἑρπετῶν ὅσα ἦν με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ κιβωτῷ καὶ ἐπήγαγεν ὁ θεὸς πνεῦμα ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ ἐκόπασεν τὸ ὕδωρ
2 καὶ ἐπεκαλύφθησαν αἱ πηγαὶ τῆς ἀβύσσου καὶ οἱ καταρράκται τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ συνεσχέθη ὁ ὑετὸς ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ
3 καὶ ἐνεδίδου τὸ ὕδωρ πορευόμενον ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἐνεδίδου καὶ ἠλαττονοῦτο τὸ ὕδωρ μετὰ πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν ἡμέρας
4 καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἡ κιβωτὸς ἐν μηνὶ τῷ ἑβδόμῳ ἑβδόμῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνός ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη τὰ Αραρατ
5 τὸ δὲ ὕδωρ πορευόμενον ἠλαττονοῦτο ἕως τοῦ δεκάτου μηνός ἐν δὲ τῷ ἑνδεκάτῳ μηνί τῇ πρώτῃ τοῦ μηνός ὤφθησαν αἱ κεφαλαὶ τῶν ὀρέων
6 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας ἠνέῳξεν Νωε τὴν θυρίδα τῆς κιβωτοῦ ἣν ἐποίησεν
7 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τὸν κόρακα τοῦ ἰδεῖν εἰ κεκόπακεν τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ ἐξελθὼν οὐχ ὑπέστρεψεν ἕως τοῦ ξηρανθῆναι τὸ ὕδωρ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς
8 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τὴν περιστερὰν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ ἰδεῖν εἰ κεκόπακεν τὸ ὕδωρ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς
9 καὶ οὐχ εὑροῦσα ἡ περιστερὰ ἀνάπαυσιν τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτῆς ὑπέστρεψεν πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν κιβωτόν ὅτι ὕδωρ ἦν ἐπὶ παντὶ προσώπῳ πάσης τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐκτείνας τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὴν πρὸς ἑαυτὸν εἰς τὴν κιβωτόν
10 καὶ ἐπισχὼν ἔτι ἡμέρας ἑπτὰ ἑτέρας πάλιν ἐξαπέστειλεν τὴν περιστερὰν ἐκ τῆς κιβωτοῦ
11 καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἡ περιστερὰ τὸ πρὸς ἑσπέραν καὶ εἶχεν φύλλον ἐλαίας κάρφος ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῆς καὶ ἔγνω Νωε ὅτι κεκόπακεν τὸ ὕδωρ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς
12 καὶ ἐπισχὼν ἔτι ἡμέρας ἑπτὰ ἑτέρας πάλιν ἐξαπέστειλεν τὴν περιστεράν καὶ οὐ προσέθετο τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς αὐτὸν ἔτι
13 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἑνὶ καὶ ἑξακοσιοστῷ ἔτει ἐν τῇ ζωῇ τοῦ Νωε τοῦ πρώτου μηνός μιᾷ τοῦ μηνός ἐξέλιπεν τὸ ὕδωρ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἀπεκάλυψεν Νωε τὴν στέγην τῆς κιβωτοῦ ἣν ἐποίησεν καὶ εἶδεν ὅτι ἐξέλιπεν τὸ ὕδωρ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς
14 ἐν δὲ τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἑβδόμῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνός ἐξηράνθη ἡ γῆ

15 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς τῷ Νωε λέγων
16 ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς κιβωτοῦ σὺ καὶ ἡ γυνή σου καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες τῶν υἱῶν σου μετὰ σοῦ
17 καὶ πάντα τὰ θηρία ὅσα ἐστὶν μετὰ σοῦ καὶ πᾶσα σὰρξ ἀπὸ πετεινῶν ἕως κτηνῶν καὶ πᾶν ἑρπετὸν κινούμενον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἐξάγαγε μετὰ σεαυτοῦ καὶ αὐξάνεσθε καὶ πληθύνεσθε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
18 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Νωε καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ
19 καὶ πάντα τὰ θηρία καὶ πάντα τὰ κτήνη καὶ πᾶν πετεινὸν καὶ πᾶν ἑρπετὸν κινούμενον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κατὰ γένος αὐτῶν ἐξήλθοσαν ἐκ τῆς κιβωτοῦ
20 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν Νωε θυσιαστήριον τῷ θεῷ καὶ ἔλαβεν ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν καθαρῶν καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν πετεινῶν τῶν καθαρῶν καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ὁλοκαρπώσεις ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον
21 καὶ ὠσφράνθη κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας καὶ εἶπεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς διανοηθείς οὐ προσθήσω ἔτι τοῦ καταράσασθαι τὴν γῆν διὰ τὰ ἔργα τῶν ἀνθρώπων ὅτι ἔγκειται ἡ διάνοια τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐπιμελῶς ἐπὶ τὰ πονηρὰ ἐκ νεότητος οὐ προσθήσω οὖν ἔτι πατάξαι πᾶσαν σάρκα ζῶσαν καθὼς ἐποίησα
22 πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς γῆς σπέρμα καὶ θερισμός ψῦχος καὶ καῦμα θέρος καὶ ἔαρ ἡμέραν καὶ νύκτα οὐ καταπαύσουσιν
