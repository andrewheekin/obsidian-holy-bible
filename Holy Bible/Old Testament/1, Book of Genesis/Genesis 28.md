# Book of Genesis 28 (RSVCE)

1 Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, “You shall not marry one of the Canaanite women.
2 Arise, go to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuʹel your mother’s father; and take as wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother.
3 God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.
4 May he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your descendants with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojournings which God gave to Abraham!”
5 Thus Isaac sent Jacob away; and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, the son of Bethuʹel the Arameʹan, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.
### Esau Marries Ishmael’s Daughter
6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he charged him, “You shall not marry one of the Canaanite women,”
7 and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram.
8 So when Esau saw that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father,
9 Esau went to Ishʹmael and took to wife, besides the wives he had, Maʹhalath the daughter of Ishʹmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaʹioth.
### Jacob’s Dream at Bethel
10 Jacob left Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.
11 And he came to a certain place, and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep.
12 And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!
13 And behold, theLordstood above it and said, “I am theLord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants;
14 and your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and by you and your descendants shall all the families of the earth bless themselves.
15 Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done that of which I have spoken to you.”
16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely theLordis in this place; and I did not know it.”
17 And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”
18 So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone which he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.
19 He called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
20 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,
21 so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, then theLordshall be my God,
22 and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God’s house; and of all that thou givest me I will give the tenth to thee.”


# Liber Genesis 28 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Vocavit itaque Isaac Jacob, et benedixit eum, præcepitque ei dicens: Noli accipere conjugem de genere Chanaan:
2 sed vade, et proficiscere in Mesopotamiam Syriæ, ad domum Bathuel patris matris tuæ, et accipe tibi inde uxorem de filiabus Laban avunculi tui.
3 Deus autem omnipotens benedicat tibi, et crescere te faciat, atque multiplicet, ut sis in turbas populorum.
4 Et det tibi benedictiones Abrahæ, et semini tuo post te: ut possideas terram peregrinationis tuæ, quam pollicitus est avo tuo.
5 Cumque dimisisset eum Isaac, profectus venit in Mesopotamiam Syriæ ad Laban filium Bathuel Syri, fratrem Rebeccæ matris suæ.
6 Videns autem Esau quod benedixisset pater suus Jacob, et misisset eum in Mesopotamiam Syriæ, ut inde uxorem duceret; et quod post benedictionem præcepisset ei, dicens: Non accipies uxorem de filiabus Chanaan:
7 quodque obediens Jacob parentibus suis isset in Syriam:
8 probans quoque quod non libenter aspiceret filias Chanaan pater suus:
9 ivit ad Ismaëlem, et duxit uxorem absque iis, quas prius habebat, Maheleth filiam Ismaël filii Abraham, sororem Nabaioth.

10 Igitur egressus Jacob de Bersabee, pergebat Haran.
11 Cumque venisset ad quemdam locum, et vellet in eo requiescere post solis occubitum, tulit de lapidibus qui jacebant, et supponens capiti suo, dormivit in eodem loco.
12 Viditque in somnis scalam stantem super terram, et cacumen illius tangens cælum: angelos quoque Dei ascendentes et descendentes per eam,
13 et Dominum innixum scalæ dicentem sibi: Ego sum Dominus Deus Abraham patris tui, et Deus Isaac: terram, in qua dormis, tibi dabo et semini tuo.
14 Eritque semen tuum quasi pulvis terræ: dilataberis ad occidentem, et orientem, et septentrionem, et meridiem: et benedicentur in te et in semine tuo cunctæ tribus terræ.
15 Et ero custos tuus quocumque perrexeris, et reducam te in terram hanc: nec dimittam nisi complevero universa quæ dixi.

16 Cumque evigilasset Jacob de somno, ait: Vere Dominus est in loco isto, et ego nesciebam.
17 Pavensque, Quam terribilis est, inquit, locus iste! non est hic aliud nisi domus Dei, et porta cæli.
18 Surgens ergo Jacob mane, tulit lapidem quem supposuerat capiti suo, et erexit in titulum, fundens oleum desuper.
19 Appellavitque nomen urbis Bethel, quæ prius Luza vocabatur.
20 Vovit etiam votum, dicens: Si fuerit Deus mecum, et custodierit me in via, per quam ego ambulo, et dederit mihi panem ad vescendum, et vestimentum ad induendum,
21 reversusque fuero prospere ad domum patris mei: erit mihi Dominus in Deum,
22 et lapis iste, quem erexi in titulum, vocabitur Domus Dei: cunctorumque quæ dederis mihi, decimas offeram tibi.

1 προσκαλεσάμενος δὲ Ισαακ τὸν Ιακωβ εὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ λέγων οὐ λήμψῃ γυναῖκα ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Χανααν
2 ἀναστὰς ἀπόδραθι εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Βαθουηλ τοῦ πατρὸς τῆς μητρός σου καὶ λαβὲ σεαυτῷ ἐκεῖθεν γυναῖκα ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Λαβαν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τῆς μητρός σου
3 ὁ δὲ θεός μου εὐλογήσαι σε καὶ αὐξήσαι σε καὶ πληθύναι σε καὶ ἔσῃ εἰς συναγωγὰς ἐθνῶν
4 καὶ δῴη σοι τὴν εὐλογίαν Αβρααμ τοῦ πατρός μου σοὶ καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου μετὰ σέ κληρονομῆσαι τὴν γῆν τῆς παροικήσεώς σου ἣν ἔδωκεν ὁ θεὸς τῷ Αβρααμ
5 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ισαακ τὸν Ιακωβ καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν πρὸς Λαβαν τὸν υἱὸν Βαθουηλ τοῦ Σύρου ἀδελφὸν δὲ Ρεβεκκας τῆς μητρὸς Ιακωβ καὶ Ησαυ
6 εἶδεν δὲ Ησαυ ὅτι εὐλόγησεν Ισαακ τὸν Ιακωβ καὶ ἀπῴχετο εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν Συρίας λαβεῖν ἑαυτῷ ἐκεῖθεν γυναῖκα ἐν τῷ εὐλογεῖν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ λέγων οὐ λήμψῃ γυναῖκα ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων Χανααν
7 καὶ ἤκουσεν Ιακωβ τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν Συρίας
8 καὶ εἶδεν Ησαυ ὅτι πονηραί εἰσιν αἱ θυγατέρες Χανααν ἐναντίον Ισαακ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ
9 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ησαυ πρὸς Ισμαηλ καὶ ἔλαβεν τὴν Μαελεθ θυγατέρα Ισμαηλ τοῦ υἱοῦ Αβρααμ ἀδελφὴν Ναβαιωθ πρὸς ταῖς γυναιξὶν αὐτοῦ γυναῖκα

10 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ιακωβ ἀπὸ τοῦ φρέατος τοῦ ὅρκου καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Χαρραν
11 καὶ ἀπήντησεν τόπῳ καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐκεῖ ἔδυ γὰρ ὁ ἥλιος καὶ ἔλαβεν ἀπὸ τῶν λίθων τοῦ τόπου καὶ ἔθηκεν πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ἐκείνῳ
12 καὶ ἐνυπνιάσθη καὶ ἰδοὺ κλίμαξ ἐστηριγμένη ἐν τῇ γῇ ἧς ἡ κεφαλὴ ἀφικνεῖτο εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν καὶ οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ θεοῦ ἀνέβαινον καὶ κατέβαινον ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς
13 ὁ δὲ κύριος ἐπεστήρικτο ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς καὶ εἶπεν ἐγὼ κύριος ὁ θεὸς Αβρααμ τοῦ πατρός σου καὶ ὁ θεὸς Ισαακ μὴ φοβοῦ ἡ γῆ ἐ{F'} ἧς σὺ καθεύδεις ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς σοὶ δώσω αὐτὴν καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου
14 καὶ ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα σου ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς γῆς καὶ πλατυνθήσεται ἐπὶ θάλασσαν καὶ ἐπὶ λίβα καὶ ἐπὶ βορρᾶν καὶ ἐ{P'} ἀνατολάς καὶ ἐνευλογηθήσονται ἐν σοὶ πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου
15 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ μετὰ σοῦ διαφυλάσσων σε ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ πάσῃ οὗ ἐὰν πορευθῇς καὶ ἀποστρέψω σε εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην ὅτι οὐ μή σε ἐγκαταλίπω ἕως τοῦ ποιῆσαί με πάντα ὅσα ἐλάλησά σοι

16 καὶ ἐξηγέρθη Ιακωβ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕπνου αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ὅτι ἔστιν κύριος ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ ἐγὼ δὲ οὐκ ᾔδειν
17 καὶ ἐφοβήθη καὶ εἶπεν ὡς φοβερὸς ὁ τόπος οὗτος οὐκ ἔστιν τοῦτο ἀλ{L'} ἢ οἶκος θεοῦ καὶ αὕτη ἡ πύλη τοῦ οὐρανοῦ
18 καὶ ἀνέστη Ιακωβ τὸ πρωὶ καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸν λίθον ὃν ὑπέθηκεν ἐκεῖ πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὸν στήλην καὶ ἐπέχεεν ἔλαιον ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον αὐτῆς
19 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ιακωβ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου Οἶκος θεοῦ καὶ Ουλαμλους ἦν ὄνομα τῇ πόλει τὸ πρότερον
20 καὶ ηὔξατο Ιακωβ εὐχὴν λέγων ἐὰν ᾖ κύριος ὁ θεὸς με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ διαφυλάξῃ με ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ταύτῃ ᾗ ἐγὼ πορεύομαι καὶ δῷ μοι ἄρτον φαγεῖν καὶ ἱμάτιον περιβαλέσθαι
21 καὶ ἀποστρέψῃ με μετὰ σωτηρίας εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου καὶ ἔσται μοι κύριος εἰς θεόν
22 καὶ ὁ λίθος οὗτος ὃν ἔστησα στήλην ἔσται μοι οἶκος θεοῦ καὶ πάντων ὧν ἐάν μοι δῷς δεκάτην ἀποδεκατώσω αὐτά σοι
