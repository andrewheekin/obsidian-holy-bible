# Book of Genesis 44 (RSVCE)

### Joseph Detains Benjamin
1 Then he commanded the steward of his house, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack,
2 and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph told him.
3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their asses.
4 When they had gone but a short distance from the city, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you returned evil for good? Why have you stolen my silver cup?
5 Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he divines? You have done wrong in so doing.’ ”
6 When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words.
7 They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!
8 Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan; how then should we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house?
9 With whomever of your servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”
10 He said, “Let it be as you say: he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and the rest of you shall be blameless.”
11 Then every man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and every man opened his sack.
12 And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
13 Then they rent their clothes, and every man loaded his ass, and they returned to the city.
14 When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, he was still there; and they fell before him to the ground.
15 Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed divine?”
16 And Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.”
17 But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”
### Judah Pleads for Benjamin’s Release
18 Then Judah went up to him and said, “O my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant; for you are like Pharaoh himself.
19 My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’
20 And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother’s children; and his father loves him.’
21 Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.’
22 We said to my lord, ‘The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’
23 Then you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.’
24 When we went back to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord.
25 And when our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food,’
26 we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’
27 Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons;
28 one left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces; and I have never seen him since.
29 If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol.’
30 Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the lad’s life,
31 when he sees that the lad is not with us, he will die; and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
32 For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame in the sight of my father all my life.’
33 Now therefore, let your servant, I pray you, remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord; and let the lad go back with his brothers.
34 For how can I go back to my father if the lad is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would come upon my father.”


# Liber Genesis 44 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Præcepit autem Joseph dispensatori domus suæ, dicens: Imple saccos eorum frumento, quantum possunt capere: et pone pecuniam singulorum in summitate sacci.
2 Scyphum autem meum argenteum, et pretium quod dedit tritici, pone in ore sacci junioris. Factumque est ita.
3 Et orto mane, dimissi sunt cum asinis suis.
4 Jamque urbem exierant, et processerant paululum: tunc Joseph accersito dispensatore domus, Surge, inquit, et persequere viros: et apprehensis dicito: Quare reddidistis malum pro bono?
5 scyphus, quem furati estis, ipse est in quo bibit dominus meus, et in quo augurari solet: pessimam rem fecistis.
6 Fecit ille ut jusserat: et apprehensis per ordinem locutus est.
7 Qui responderunt: Quare sic loquitur dominus noster, ut servi tui tantum flagitii commiserint?
8 pecuniam, quam invenimus in summitate saccorum, reportavimus ad te de terra Chanaan: et quomodo consequens est ut furati simus de domo domini tui aurum vel argentum?
9 apud quemcumque fuerit inventum servorum tuorum quod quæris, moriatur, et nos erimus servi domini nostri.
10 Qui dixit eis: Fiat juxta vestram sententiam: apud quemcumque fuerit inventus, ipse sit servus meus, vos autem eritis innoxii.
11 Itaque festinato deponentes in terram saccos, aperuerunt singuli.
12 Quos scrutatus, incipiens a majore usque ad minimum, invenit scyphum in sacco Benjamin.

13 At illi, scissis vestibus, oneratisque rursum asinis, reversi sunt in oppidum.
14 Primusque Judas cum fratribus ingressus est ad Joseph (necdum enim de loco abierat) omnesque ante eum pariter in terram corruerunt.
15 Quibus ille ait: Cur sic agere voluistis? an ignoratis quod non sit similis mei in augurandi scientia?
16 Cui Judas: Quid respondebimus, inquit, domino meo? vel quid loquemur, aut juste poterimus obtendere? Deus invenit iniquitatem servorum tuorum: en omnes servi sumus domini mei, et nos, et apud quem inventus est scyphus.
17 Respondit Joseph: Absit a me ut sic agam: qui furatus est scyphum, ipse sit servus meus: vos autem abite liberi ad patrem vestrum.

18 Accedens autem propius Judas, confidenter ait: Oro, domini mi, loquatur servus tuus verbum in auribus tuis, et ne irascaris famulo tuo: tu es enim post Pharaonem
19 dominus meus. Interrogasti prius servos tuos: Habetis patrem aut fratrem?
20 et nos respondimus tibi domino meo: Est nobis pater senex, et puer parvulus, qui in senectute illius natus est: cujus uterinus frater mortuus est: et ipsum solum habet mater sua, pater vero tenere diliget eum.
21 Dixistique servis tuis: Adducite eum ad me, et ponam oculos meos super illum.
22 Suggessimus domino meo: Non potest puer relinquere patrem suum: si enim illum dimiserit, morietur.
23 Et dixisti servis tuis: Nisi venerit frater vester minimus vobiscum, non videbitis amplius faciem meam.

24 Cum ergo ascendissemus ad famulum tuum patrem nostrum, narravimus ei omnia quæ locutus est dominus meus.
25 Et dixit pater noster: Revertimini, et emite nobis parum tritici.
26 Cui diximus: Ire non possumus: si frater noster minimus descenderit nobiscum, proficiscemur simul: alioquin illo absente, non audemus videre faciem viri.
27 Ad quæ ille respondit: Vos scitis quod duos genuerit mihi uxor mea.
28 Egressus est unus, et dixistis: Bestia devoravit eum: et hucusque non comparet.
29 Si tuleritis et istum, et aliquid ei in via contigerit, deducetis canos meos cum mœrore ad inferos.
30 Igitur si intravero ad servum tuum patrem nostrum, et puer defuerit (cum anima illius ex hujus anima pendeat),
31 videritque eum non esse nobiscum, morietur, et deducent famuli tui canos ejus cum dolore ad inferos.
32 Ego proprie servus tuus sim qui in meam hunc recepi fidem, et spopondi dicens: Nisi reduxero eum, peccati reus ero in patrem meum omni tempore.
33 Manebo itaque servus tuus pro puero in ministerio domini mei, et puer ascendat cum fratribus suis.
34 Non enim possum redire ad patrem meum, absente puero: ne calamitatis, quæ oppressura est patrem meum, testis assistam.


# Γένεσις 44 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐνετείλατο Ιωσηφ τῷ ὄντι ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ λέγων πλήσατε τοὺς μαρσίππους τῶν ἀνθρώπων βρωμάτων ὅσα ἐὰν δύνωνται ἆραι καὶ ἐμβάλατε ἑκάστου τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ μαρσίππου
2 καὶ τὸ κόνδυ μου τὸ ἀργυροῦν ἐμβάλατε εἰς τὸν μάρσιππον τοῦ νεωτέρου καὶ τὴν τιμὴν τοῦ σίτου αὐτοῦ ἐγενήθη δὲ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ιωσηφ καθὼς εἶπεν
3 τὸ πρωὶ διέφαυσεν καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἀπεστάλησαν αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ ὄνοι αὐτῶν
4 ἐξελθόντων δὲ αὐτῶν τὴν πόλιν οὐκ ἀπέσχον μακράν καὶ Ιωσηφ εἶπεν τῷ ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ ἀναστὰς ἐπιδίωξον ὀπίσω τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ καταλήμψῃ αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς τί ὅτι ἀνταπεδώκατε πονηρὰ ἀντὶ καλῶν
5 ἵνα τί ἐκλέψατέ μου τὸ κόνδυ τὸ ἀργυροῦν οὐ τοῦτό ἐστιν ἐν ᾧ πίνει ὁ κύριός μου αὐτὸς δὲ οἰωνισμῷ οἰωνίζεται ἐν αὐτῷ πονηρὰ συντετέλεσθε ἃ πεποιήκατε
6 εὑρὼν δὲ αὐτοὺς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα
7 οἱ δὲ εἶπον αὐτῷ ἵνα τί λαλεῖ ὁ κύριος κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα μὴ γένοιτο τοῖς παισίν σου ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο
8 εἰ τὸ μὲν ἀργύριον ὃ εὕρομεν ἐν τοῖς μαρσίπποις ἡμῶν ἀπεστρέψαμεν πρὸς σὲ ἐκ γῆς Χανααν πῶς ἂν κλέψαιμεν ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ κυρίου σου ἀργύριον ἢ χρυσίον
9 πα{R'} ᾧ ἂν εὑρεθῇ τὸ κόνδυ τῶν παίδων σου ἀποθνῃσκέτω καὶ ἡμεῖς δὲ ἐσόμεθα παῖδες τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν
10 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν καὶ νῦν ὡς λέγετε οὕτως ἔσται ὁ ἄνθρωπος πα{R'} ᾧ ἂν εὑρεθῇ τὸ κόνδυ αὐτὸς ἔσται μου παῖς ὑμεῖς δὲ ἔσεσθε καθαροί
11 καὶ ἔσπευσαν καὶ καθεῖλαν ἕκαστος τὸν μάρσιππον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ ἤνοιξαν ἕκαστος τὸν μάρσιππον αὐτοῦ
12 ἠρεύνα δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου ἀρξάμενος ἕως ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν νεώτερον καὶ εὗρεν τὸ κόνδυ ἐν τῷ μαρσίππῳ τῷ Βενιαμιν

13 καὶ διέρρηξαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἕκαστος τὸν μάρσιππον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν ὄνον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς τὴν πόλιν
14 εἰσῆλθεν δὲ Ιουδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ πρὸς Ιωσηφ ἔτι αὐτοῦ ὄντος ἐκεῖ καὶ ἔπεσον ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
15 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ τί τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο ὃ ἐποιήσατε οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι οἰωνισμῷ οἰωνιεῖται ἄνθρωπος οἷος ἐγώ
16 εἶπεν δὲ Ιουδας τί ἀντεροῦμεν τῷ κυρίῳ ἢ τί λαλήσωμεν ἢ τί δικαιωθῶμεν ὁ δὲ θεὸς εὗρεν τὴν ἀδικίαν τῶν παίδων σου ἰδού ἐσμεν οἰκέται τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ πα{R'} ᾧ εὑρέθη τὸ κόνδυ
17 εἶπεν δὲ Ιωσηφ μή μοι γένοιτο ποιῆσαι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ὁ ἄνθρωπος πα{R'} ᾧ εὑρέθη τὸ κόνδυ αὐτὸς ἔσται μου παῖς ὑμεῖς δὲ ἀνάβητε μετὰ σωτηρίας πρὸς τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν

18 ἐγγίσας δὲ αὐτῷ Ιουδας εἶπεν δέομαι κύριε λαλησάτω ὁ παῖς σου ῥῆμα ἐναντίον σου καὶ μὴ θυμωθῇς τῷ παιδί σου ὅτι σὺ εἶ μετὰ Φαραω
19 κύριε σὺ ἠρώτησας τοὺς παῖδάς σου λέγων εἰ ἔχετε πατέρα ἢ ἀδελφόν
20 καὶ εἴπαμεν τῷ κυρίῳ ἔστιν ἡμῖν πατὴρ πρεσβύτερος καὶ παιδίον γήρως νεώτερον αὐτῷ καὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπέθανεν αὐτὸς δὲ μόνος ὑπελείφθη τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ δὲ πατὴρ αὐτὸν ἠγάπησεν
21 εἶπας δὲ τοῖς παισίν σου καταγάγετε αὐτὸν πρός με καὶ ἐπιμελοῦμαι αὐτοῦ
22 καὶ εἴπαμεν τῷ κυρίῳ οὐ δυνήσεται τὸ παιδίον καταλιπεῖν τὸν πατέρα ἐὰν δὲ καταλίπῃ τὸν πατέρα ἀποθανεῖται
23 σὺ δὲ εἶπας τοῖς παισίν σου ἐὰν μὴ καταβῇ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος με{Q'} ὑμῶν οὐ προσθήσεσθε ἔτι ἰδεῖν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου

24 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἀνέβημεν πρὸς τὸν παῖδά σου πατέρα δὲ ἡμῶν ἀπηγγείλαμεν αὐτῷ τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ κυρίου
25 εἶπεν δὲ ἡμῖν ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν βαδίσατε πάλιν ἀγοράσατε ἡμῖν μικρὰ βρώματα
26 ἡμεῖς δὲ εἴπαμεν οὐ δυνησόμεθα καταβῆναι ἀλ{L'} εἰ μὲν ὁ ἀδελφὸς ἡμῶν ὁ νεώτερος καταβαίνει με{Q'} ἡμῶν καταβησόμεθα οὐ γὰρ δυνησόμεθα ἰδεῖν τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τοῦ νεωτέρου μὴ ὄντος με{Q'} ἡμῶν
27 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ παῖς σου ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ὑμεῖς γινώσκετε ὅτι δύο ἔτεκέν μοι ἡ γυνή
28 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ εἷς ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ εἴπατε ὅτι θηριόβρωτος γέγονεν καὶ οὐκ εἶδον αὐτὸν ἔτι καὶ νῦν
29 ἐὰν οὖν λάβητε καὶ τοῦτον ἐκ προσώπου μου καὶ συμβῇ αὐτῷ μαλακία ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ κατάξετέ μου τὸ γῆρας μετὰ λύπης εἰς ᾅδου
30 νῦν οὖν ἐὰν εἰσπορεύωμαι πρὸς τὸν παῖδά σου πατέρα δὲ ἡμῶν καὶ τὸ παιδάριον μὴ ᾖ με{Q'} ἡμῶν ἡ δὲ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ ἐκκρέμαται ἐκ τῆς τούτου ψυχῆς
31 καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν αὐτὸν μὴ ὂν τὸ παιδάριον με{Q'} ἡμῶν τελευτήσει καὶ κατάξουσιν οἱ παῖδές σου τὸ γῆρας τοῦ παιδός σου πατρὸς δὲ ἡμῶν με{T'} ὀδύνης εἰς ᾅδου
32 ὁ γὰρ παῖς σου ἐκδέδεκται τὸ παιδίον παρὰ τοῦ πατρὸς λέγων ἐὰν μὴ ἀγάγω αὐτὸν πρὸς σὲ καὶ στήσω αὐτὸν ἐναντίον σου ἡμαρτηκὼς ἔσομαι πρὸς τὸν πατέρα πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
33 νῦν οὖν παραμενῶ σοι παῖς ἀντὶ τοῦ παιδίου οἰκέτης τοῦ κυρίου τὸ δὲ παιδίον ἀναβήτω μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν
34 πῶς γὰρ ἀναβήσομαι πρὸς τὸν πατέρα τοῦ παιδίου μὴ ὄντος με{Q'} ἡμῶν ἵνα μὴ ἴδω τὰ κακά ἃ εὑρήσει τὸν πατέρα μου
