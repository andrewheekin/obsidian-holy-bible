# Book of Genesis 37 (RSVCE)

### Joseph Dreams of Greatness
1 Jacob dwelt in the land of his father’s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
2 This is the history of the family of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought an ill report of them to their father.
3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves.
4 But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.
5 Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they only hated him the more.
6 He said to them, “Hear this dream which I have dreamed:
7 behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and stood upright; and behold, your sheaves gathered round it, and bowed down to my sheaf.”
8 His brothers said to him, “Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to have dominion over us?” So they hated him yet more for his dreams and for his words.
9 Then he dreamed another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed another dream; and behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
10 But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?”
11 And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.
### Joseph Is Sold by His Brothers
12 Now his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock near Shechem.
13 And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” And he said to him, “Here I am.”
14 So he said to him, “Go now, see if it is well with your brothers, and with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
15 And a man found him wandering in the fields; and the man asked him, “What are you seeking?”
16 “I am seeking my brothers,” he said, “tell me, I pray you, where they are pasturing the flock.”
17 And the man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan.
18 They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him.
19 They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer.
20 Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild beast has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.”
21 But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, “Let us not take his life.”
22 And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him”—that he might rescue him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.
23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore;
24 and they took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty, there was no water in it.
25 Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ishʹmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.
26 Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?
27 Come, let us sell him to the Ishʹmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers heeded him.
28 Then Midʹianite traders passed by; and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishʹmaelites for twenty shekels of silver; and they took Joseph to Egypt.
29 When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes
30 and returned to his brothers, and said, “The lad is gone; and I, where shall I go?”
31 Then they took Joseph’s robe, and killed a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood;
32 and they sent the long robe with sleeves and brought it to their father, and said, “This we have found; see now whether it is your son’s robe or not.”
33 And he recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s robe; a wild beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.”
34 Then Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
35 All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and said, “No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” Thus his father wept for him.
36 Meanwhile the Midʹianites had sold him in Egypt to Potʹi-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.


# Liber Genesis 37 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Habitavit autem Jacob in terra Chanaan, in qua pater suus peregrinatus est.
2 Et hæ sunt generationes ejus: Joseph cum sedecim esset annorum, pascebat gregem cum fratribus suis adhuc puer: et erat cum filiis Balæ et Zelphæ uxorum patris sui: accusavitque fratres suos apud patrem crimine pessimo.
3 Israël autem diligebat Joseph super omnes filios suos, eo quod in senectute genuisset eum: fecitque ei tunicam polymitam.
4 Videntes autem fratres ejus quod a patre plus cunctis filiis amaretur, oderant eum, nec poterant ei quidquam pacifice loqui.
5 Accidit quoque ut visum somnium referret fratribus suis: quæ causa majoris odii seminarium fuit.
6 Dixitque ad eos: Audite somnium meum quod vidi:
7 putabam nos ligare manipulos in agro: et quasi consurgere manipulum meum, et stare, vestrosque manipulos circumstantes adorare manipulum meum.
8 Responderunt fratres ejus: Numquid rex noster eris? aut subjiciemur ditioni tuæ? Hæc ergo causa somniorum atque sermonum, invidiæ et odii fomitem ministravit.
9 Aliud quoque vidit somnium, quod narrans fratribus, ait: Vidi per somnium, quasi solem, et lunam, et stellas undecim adorare me.
10 Quod cum patri suo, et fratribus retulisset, increpavit eum pater suus, et dixit: Quid sibi vult hoc somnium quod vidisti? num ego et mater tua, et fratres tui adorabimus te super terram?
11 Invidebant ei igitur fratres sui: pater vero rem tacitus considerabat.

12 Cumque fratres illius in pascendis gregibus patris morarentur in Sichem,
13 dixit ad eum Israël: Fratres tui pascunt oves in Sichimis: veni, mittam te ad eos. Quo respondente,
14 Præsto sum, ait ei: Vade, et vide si cuncta prospera sint erga fratres tuos, et pecora: et renuntia mihi quid agatur. Missus de valle Hebron, venit in Sichem:
15 invenitque eum vir errantem in agro, et interrogavit quid quæreret.
16 At ille respondit: Fratres meos quæro: indica mihi ubi pascant greges.
17 Dixitque ei vir: Recesserunt de loco isto: audivi autem eos dicentes: Eamus in Dothain. Perrexit ergo Joseph post fratres suos, et invenit eos in Dothain.
18 Qui cum vidissent eum procul, antequam accederet ad eos, cogitaverunt illum occidere:
19 et mutuo loquebantur: Ecce somniator venit:
20 venite, occidamus eum, et mittamus in cisternam veterem: dicemusque: Fera pessima devoravit eum: et tunc apparebit quid illi prosint somnia sua.
21 Audiens autem hoc Ruben, nitebatur liberare eum de manibus eorum, et dicebat:
22 Non interficiatis animam ejus, nec effundatis sanguinem: sed projicite eum in cisternam hanc, quæ est in solitudine, manusque vestras servate innoxias: hoc autem dicebat, volens eripere eum de manibus eorum, et reddere patri suo.
23 Confestim igitur ut pervenit ad fratres suos, nudaverunt eum tunica talari et polymita:
24 miseruntque eum in cisternam veterem, quæ non habebat aquam.

25 Et sedentes ut comederent panem, viderunt Ismaëlitas viatores venire de Galaad, et camelos eorum portantes aromata, et resinam, et stacten in Ægyptum.
26 Dixit ergo Judas fratribus suis: Quid nobis prodest si occiderimus fratrem nostrum, et celaverimus sanguinem ipsius?
27 melius est ut venundetur Ismaëlitis, et manus nostræ non polluantur: frater enim et caro nostra est. Acquieverunt fratres sermonibus illius.
28 Et prætereuntibus Madianitis negotiatoribus, extrahentes eum de cisterna, vendiderunt eum Ismaëlitis, viginti argenteis: qui duxerunt eum in Ægyptum.
29 Reversusque Ruben ad cisternam, non invenit puerum:
30 et scissis vestibus pergens ad fratres suos, ait: Puer non comparet, et ego quo ibo?

31 Tulerunt autem tunicam ejus, et in sanguine hædi, quem occiderant, tinxerunt:
32 mittentes qui ferrent ad patrem, et dicerent: Hanc invenimus: vide utrum tunica filii tui sit, an non.
33 Quam cum agnovisset pater, ait: Tunica filii mei est: fera pessima comedit eum, bestia devoravit Joseph.
34 Scissisque vestibus, indutus est cilicio, lugens filium suum multo tempore.
35 Congregatis autem cunctis liberis ejus ut lenirent dolorem patris, noluit consolationem accipere, sed ait: Descendam ad filium meum lugens in infernum. Et illo perseverante in fletu,
36 Madianitæ vendiderunt Joseph in Ægypto Putiphari eunucho Pharaonis, magistro militum.

1 κατῴκει δὲ Ιακωβ ἐν τῇ γῇ οὗ παρῴκησεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἐν γῇ Χανααν
2 αὗται δὲ αἱ γενέσεις Ιακωβ Ιωσηφ δέκα ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν ἦν ποιμαίνων μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ τὰ πρόβατα ὢν νέος μετὰ τῶν υἱῶν Βαλλας καὶ μετὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ζελφας τῶν γυναικῶν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ κατήνεγκεν δὲ Ιωσηφ ψόγον πονηρὸν πρὸς Ισραηλ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν
3 Ιακωβ δὲ ἠγάπα τὸν Ιωσηφ παρὰ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ ὅτι υἱὸς γήρους ἦν αὐτῷ ἐποίησεν δὲ αὐτῷ χιτῶνα ποικίλον
4 ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ὅτι αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ φιλεῖ ἐκ πάντων τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ἐμίσησαν αὐτὸν καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο λαλεῖν αὐτῷ οὐδὲν εἰρηνικόν
5 ἐνυπνιασθεὶς δὲ Ιωσηφ ἐνύπνιον ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτὸ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἀκούσατε τοῦ ἐνυπνίου τούτου οὗ ἐνυπνιάσθην
7 ᾤμην ἡμᾶς δεσμεύειν δράγματα ἐν μέσῳ τῷ πεδίῳ καὶ ἀνέστη τὸ ἐμὸν δράγμα καὶ ὠρθώθη περιστραφέντα δὲ τὰ δράγματα ὑμῶν προσεκύνησαν τὸ ἐμὸν δράγμα
8 εἶπαν δὲ αὐτῷ οἱ ἀδελφοί μὴ βασιλεύων βασιλεύσεις ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς ἢ κυριεύων κυριεύσεις ἡμῶν καὶ προσέθεντο ἔτι μισεῖν αὐτὸν ἕνεκεν τῶν ἐνυπνίων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕνεκεν τῶν ῥημάτων αὐτοῦ
9 εἶδεν δὲ ἐνύπνιον ἕτερον καὶ διηγήσατο αὐτὸ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ἰδοὺ ἐνυπνιασάμην ἐνύπνιον ἕτερον ὥσπερ ὁ ἥλιος καὶ ἡ σελήνη καὶ ἕνδεκα ἀστέρες προσεκύνουν με
10 καὶ ἐπετίμησεν αὐτῷ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τί τὸ ἐνύπνιον τοῦτο ὃ ἐνυπνιάσθης ἆρά γε ἐλθόντες ἐλευσόμεθα ἐγώ τε καὶ ἡ μήτηρ σου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου προσκυνῆσαί σοι ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
11 ἐζήλωσαν δὲ αὐτὸν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ δὲ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ διετήρησεν τὸ ῥῆμα

12 ἐπορεύθησαν δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ βόσκειν τὰ πρόβατα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν εἰς Συχεμ
13 καὶ εἶπεν Ισραηλ πρὸς Ιωσηφ οὐχ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου ποιμαίνουσιν ἐν Συχεμ δεῦρο ἀποστείλω σε πρὸς αὐτούς εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ἰδοὺ ἐγώ
14 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Ισραηλ πορευθεὶς ἰδὲ εἰ ὑγιαίνουσιν οἱ ἀδελφοί σου καὶ τὰ πρόβατα καὶ ἀνάγγειλόν μοι καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς κοιλάδος τῆς Χεβρων καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Συχεμ
15 καὶ εὗρεν αὐτὸν ἄνθρωπος πλανώμενον ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἠρώτησεν δὲ αὐτὸν ὁ ἄνθρωπος λέγων τί ζητεῖς
16 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν τοὺς ἀδελφούς μου ζητῶ ἀνάγγειλόν μοι ποῦ βόσκουσιν
17 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἀπήρκασιν ἐντεῦθεν ἤκουσα γὰρ αὐτῶν λεγόντων πορευθῶμεν εἰς Δωθαϊμ καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ιωσηφ κατόπισθεν τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ εὗρεν αὐτοὺς ἐν Δωθαϊμ
18 προεῖδον δὲ αὐτὸν μακρόθεν πρὸ τοῦ ἐγγίσαι αὐτὸν πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐπονηρεύοντο τοῦ ἀποκτεῖναι αὐτόν
19 εἶπαν δὲ ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἰδοὺ ὁ ἐνυπνιαστὴς ἐκεῖνος ἔρχεται
20 νῦν οὖν δεῦτε ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτὸν καὶ ῥίψωμεν αὐτὸν εἰς ἕνα τῶν λάκκων καὶ ἐροῦμεν θηρίον πονηρὸν κατέφαγεν αὐτόν καὶ ὀψόμεθα τί ἔσται τὰ ἐνύπνια αὐτοῦ
21 ἀκούσας δὲ Ρουβην ἐξείλατο αὐτὸν ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπεν οὐ πατάξομεν αὐτὸν εἰς ψυχήν
22 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ρουβην μὴ ἐκχέητε αἷμα ἐμβάλετε αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν λάκκον τοῦτον τὸν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ χεῖρα δὲ μὴ ἐπενέγκητε αὐτῷ ὅπως ἐξέληται αὐτὸν ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν καὶ ἀποδῷ αὐτὸν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ
23 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἦλθεν Ιωσηφ πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐξέδυσαν τὸν Ιωσηφ τὸν χιτῶνα τὸν ποικίλον τὸν περὶ αὐτὸν
24 καὶ λαβόντες αὐτὸν ἔρριψαν εἰς τὸν λάκκον ὁ δὲ λάκκος κενός ὕδωρ οὐκ εἶχεν

25 ἐκάθισαν δὲ φαγεῖν ἄρτον καὶ ἀναβλέψαντες τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς εἶδον καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁδοιπόροι Ισμαηλῖται ἤρχοντο ἐκ Γαλααδ καὶ αἱ κάμηλοι αὐτῶν ἔγεμον θυμιαμάτων καὶ ῥητίνης καὶ στακτῆς ἐπορεύοντο δὲ καταγαγεῖν εἰς Αἴγυπτον
26 εἶπεν δὲ Ιουδας πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ τί χρήσιμον ἐὰν ἀποκτείνωμεν τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἡμῶν καὶ κρύψωμεν τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ
27 δεῦτε ἀποδώμεθα αὐτὸν τοῖς Ισμαηλίταις τούτοις αἱ δὲ χεῖρες ἡμῶν μὴ ἔστωσαν ἐ{P'} αὐτόν ὅτι ἀδελφὸς ἡμῶν καὶ σὰρξ ἡμῶν ἐστιν ἤκουσαν δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ
28 καὶ παρεπορεύοντο οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ Μαδιηναῖοι οἱ ἔμποροι καὶ ἐξείλκυσαν καὶ ἀνεβίβασαν τὸν Ιωσηφ ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου καὶ ἀπέδοντο τὸν Ιωσηφ τοῖς Ισμαηλίταις εἴκοσι χρυσῶν καὶ κατήγαγον τὸν Ιωσηφ εἰς Αἴγυπτον
29 ἀνέστρεψεν δὲ Ρουβην ἐπὶ τὸν λάκκον καὶ οὐχ ὁρᾷ τὸν Ιωσηφ ἐν τῷ λάκκῳ καὶ διέρρηξεν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ
30 καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν τὸ παιδάριον οὐκ ἔστιν ἐγὼ δὲ ποῦ πορεύομαι ἔτι

31 λαβόντες δὲ τὸν χιτῶνα τοῦ Ιωσηφ ἔσφαξαν ἔριφον αἰγῶν καὶ ἐμόλυναν τὸν χιτῶνα τῷ αἵματι
32 καὶ ἀπέστειλαν τὸν χιτῶνα τὸν ποικίλον καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπαν τοῦτον εὕρομεν ἐπίγνωθι εἰ χιτὼν τοῦ υἱοῦ σού ἐστιν ἢ οὔ
33 καὶ ἐπέγνω αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν χιτὼν τοῦ υἱοῦ μού ἐστιν θηρίον πονηρὸν κατέφαγεν αὐτόν θηρίον ἥρπασεν τὸν Ιωσηφ
34 διέρρηξεν δὲ Ιακωβ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέθετο σάκκον ἐπὶ τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπένθει τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἡμέρας πολλάς
35 συνήχθησαν δὲ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες καὶ ἦλθον παρακαλέσαι αὐτόν καὶ οὐκ ἤθελεν παρακαλεῖσθαι λέγων ὅτι καταβήσομαι πρὸς τὸν υἱόν μου πενθῶν εἰς ᾅδου καὶ ἔκλαυσεν αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ
36 οἱ δὲ Μαδιηναῖοι ἀπέδοντο τὸν Ιωσηφ εἰς Αἴγυπτον τῷ Πετεφρη τῷ σπάδοντι Φαραω ἀρχιμαγείρῳ
