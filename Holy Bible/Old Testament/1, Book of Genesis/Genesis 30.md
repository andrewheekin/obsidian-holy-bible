# Book of Genesis 30 (RSVCE)

1 When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister; and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I shall die!”
2 Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”
3 Then she said, “Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, that she may bear upon my knees, and even I may have children through her.”
4 So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife; and Jacob went in to her.
5 And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
6 Then Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son”; therefore she called his name Dan.
7 Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
8 Then Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed”; so she called his name Naphʹtali.
9 When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
10 Then Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
11 And Leah said, “Good fortune!” so she called his name Gad.
12 Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
13 And Leah said, “Happy am I! For the women will call me happy”; so she called his name Asher.
14 In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Give me, I pray, some of your son’s mandrakes.”
15 But she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also?” Rachel said, “Then he may lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”
16 When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night.
17 And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
18 Leah said, “God has given me my hire because I gave my maid to my husband”; so she called his name Isʹsachar.
19 And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.
20 Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons”; so she called his name Zebʹulun.
21 Afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
22 Then God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her and opened her womb.
23 She conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach”;
24 and she called his name Joseph, saying, “May theLordadd to me another son!”
### Jacob Prospers at Laban’s Expense
25 When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country.
26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know the service which I have given you.”
27 But Laban said to him, “If you will allow me to say so, I have learned by divination that theLordhas blessed me because of you;
28 name your wages, and I will give it.”
29 Jacob said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you, and how your cattle have fared with me.
30 For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly; and theLordhas blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?”
31 He said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything; if you will do this for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it:
32 let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages.
33 So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen.”
34 Laban said, “Good! Let it be as you have said.”
35 But that day Laban removed the he-goats that were striped and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in charge of his sons;
36 and he set a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flock.
37 Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the rods.
38 He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the runnels, that is, the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,
39 the flocks bred in front of the rods and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.
40 And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own droves apart, and did not put them with Laban’s flock.
41 Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding Jacob laid the rods in the runnels before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the rods,
42 but for the feebler of the flock he did not lay them there; so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.
43 Thus the man grew exceedingly rich, and had large flocks, maidservants and menservants, and camels and asses.


# Liber Genesis 30 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Cernens autem Rachel quod infecunda esset, invidit sorori suæ, et ait marito suo: Da mihi liberos, alioquin moriar.
2 Cui iratus respondit Jacob: Num pro Deo ego sum, qui privavit te fructu ventris tui?
3 At illa: Habeo, inquit, famulam Balam: ingredere ad illam, ut pariat super genua mea, et habeam ex illa filios.
4 Deditque illi Balam in conjugium: quæ,
5 ingresso ad se viro, concepit, et peperit filium.
6 Dixitque Rachel: Judicavit mihi Dominus, et exaudivit vocem meam, dans mihi filium, et idcirco appellavit nomen ejus Dan.
7 Rursumque Bala concipiens, peperit alterum,
8 pro quo ait Rachel: Comparavit me Deus cum sorore mea, et invalui: vocavitque eum Nephthali.
9 Sentiens Lia quod parere desiisset, Zelpham ancillam suam marito tradidit.
10 Qua post conceptum edente filium,
11 dixit: Feliciter, et idcirco vocavit nomen ejus Gad.
12 Peperit quoque Zelpha alterum.
13 Dixitque Lia: Hoc pro beatitudine mea: beatam quippe me dicent mulieres: propterea appellavit eum Aser.

14 Egressus autem Ruben tempore messis triticeæ in agrum, reperit mandragoras, quas matri Liæ detulit. Dixitque Rachel: Da mihi partem de mandragoris filii tui.
15 Illa respondit: Parumne tibi videtur quod præripueris maritum mihi, nisi etiam mandragoras filii mei tuleris? Ait Rachel: Dormiat tecum hac nocte pro mandragoris filii tui.
16 Redeuntique ad vesperam Jacob de agro, egressa est in occursum ejus Lia, et Ad me, inquit, intrabis: quia mercede conduxi te pro mandragoris filii mei. Dormivitque cum ea nocte illa.
17 Et exaudivit Deus preces ejus, concepitque et peperit filium quintum,
18 et ait: Dedit Deus mercedem mihi, quia dedi ancillam meam viro meo: appellavitque nomen ejus Issachar.
19 Rursum Lia concipiens, peperit sextum filium,
20 et ait: Dotavit me Deus dote bona: etiam hac vice mecum erit maritus meus, eo quod genuerim ei sex filios: et idcirco appellavit nomen ejus Zabulon.
21 Post quem peperit filiam, nomine Dinam.
22 Recordatus quoque Dominus Rachelis, exaudivit eam, et aperuit vulvam ejus.
23 Quæ concepit, et peperit filium, dicens: Abstulit Deus opprobrium meum.
24 Et vocavit nomen ejus Joseph, dicens: Addat mihi Dominus filium alterum.

25 Nato autem Joseph, dixit Jacob socero suo: Dimitte me ut revertar in patriam, et ad terram meam.
26 Da mihi uxores, et liberos meos, pro quibus servivi tibi, ut abeam: tu nosti servitutem qua servivi tibi.
27 Ait illi Laban: Inveniam gratiam in conspectu tuo, experimento didici, quia benedixerit mihi Deus propter te:
28 constitue mercedem tuam quam dem tibi.
29 At ille respondit: Tu nosti quomodo servierim tibi, et quanta in manibus meis fuerit possessio tua.
30 Modicum habuisti antequam venirem ad te, et nunc dives effectus es: benedixitque tibi Dominus ad introitum meum. Justum est igitur ut aliquando provideam etiam domui meæ.
31 Dixitque Laban: Quid tibi dabo? At ille ait: Nihil volo: sed si feceris quod postulo, iterum pascam, et custodiam pecora tua.
32 Gyra omnes greges tuos, et separa cunctas oves varias, et sparso vellere; quodcumque furvum, et maculosum, variumque fuerit, tam in ovibus quam in capris, erit merces mea.
33 Respondebitque mihi cras justitia mea, quando placiti tempus advenerit coram te: et omnia quæ non fuerint varia, et maculosa, et furva, tam in ovibus quam in capris, furti me arguent.
34 Dixitque Laban: Gratum habeo quod petis.
35 Et separavit in die illa capras, et oves, et hircos, et arietes varios, atque maculosos: cunctum autem gregem unicolorem, id est albi et nigri velleris, tradidit in manu filiorum suorum.
36 Et posuit spatium itineris trium dierum inter se et generum, qui pascebat reliquos greges ejus.

37 Tollens ergo Jacob virgas populeas virides, et amygdalinas, et ex platanis, ex parte decorticavit eas: detractisque corticibus, in his, quæ spoliata fuerant, candor apparuit: illa vero quæ integra fuerant, viridia permanserunt: atque in hunc modum color effectus est varius.
38 Posuitque eas in canalibus, ubi effundebatur aqua: ut cum venissent greges ad bibendum, ante oculos haberent virgas, et in aspectu earum conciperent.
39 Factumque est ut in ipso calore coitus, oves intuerentur virgas, et parerent maculosa, et varia, et diverso colore respersa.

40 Divisitque gregem Jacob, et posuit virgas in canalibus ante oculos arietum: erant autem alba et nigra quæque, Laban; cetera vero, Jacob, separatis inter se gregibus.
41 Igitur quando primo tempore ascendebantur oves, ponebat Jacob virgas in canalibus aquarum ante oculos arietum et ovium, ut in earum contemplatione conciperent:
42 quando vero serotina admissura erat, et conceptus extremus, non ponebat eas. Factaque sunt ea quæ erant serotina, Laban: et quæ primi temporis, Jacob.
43 Ditatusque est homo ultra modum, et habuit greges multos, ancillas et servos, camelos et asinos.

1 ἰδοῦσα δὲ Ραχηλ ὅτι οὐ τέτοκεν τῷ Ιακωβ καὶ ἐζήλωσεν Ραχηλ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῆς καὶ εἶπεν τῷ Ιακωβ δός μοι τέκνα εἰ δὲ μή τελευτήσω ἐγώ
2 ἐθυμώθη δὲ Ιακωβ τῇ Ραχηλ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ μὴ ἀντὶ θεοῦ ἐγώ εἰμι ὃς ἐστέρησέν σε καρπὸν κοιλίας
3 εἶπεν δὲ Ραχηλ τῷ Ιακωβ ἰδοὺ ἡ παιδίσκη μου Βαλλα εἴσελθε πρὸς αὐτήν καὶ τέξεται ἐπὶ τῶν γονάτων μου καὶ τεκνοποιήσομαι κἀγὼ ἐξ αὐτῆς
4 καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ Βαλλαν τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτῆς αὐτῷ γυναῖκα εἰσῆλθεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὴν Ιακωβ
5 καὶ συνέλαβεν Βαλλα ἡ παιδίσκη Ραχηλ καὶ ἔτεκεν τῷ Ιακωβ υἱόν
6 καὶ εἶπεν Ραχηλ ἔκρινέν μοι ὁ θεὸς καὶ ἐπήκουσεν τῆς φωνῆς μου καὶ ἔδωκέν μοι υἱόν διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Δαν
7 καὶ συνέλαβεν ἔτι Βαλλα ἡ παιδίσκη Ραχηλ καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν δεύτερον τῷ Ιακωβ
8 καὶ εἶπεν Ραχηλ συνελάβετό μοι ὁ θεός καὶ συνανεστράφην τῇ ἀδελφῇ μου καὶ ἠδυνάσθην καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Νεφθαλι
9 εἶδεν δὲ Λεια ὅτι ἔστη τοῦ τίκτειν καὶ ἔλαβεν Ζελφαν τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτῆς καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν τῷ Ιακωβ γυναῖκα
10 εἰσῆλθεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὴν Ιακωβ καὶ συνέλαβεν Ζελφα ἡ παιδίσκη Λειας καὶ ἔτεκεν τῷ Ιακωβ υἱόν
11 καὶ εἶπεν Λεια ἐν τύχῃ καὶ ἐπωνόμασεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Γαδ
12 καὶ συνέλαβεν Ζελφα ἡ παιδίσκη Λειας καὶ ἔτεκεν ἔτι τῷ Ιακωβ υἱὸν δεύτερον
13 καὶ εἶπεν Λεια μακαρία ἐγώ ὅτι μακαρίζουσίν με αἱ γυναῖκες καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ασηρ

14 ἐπορεύθη δὲ Ρουβην ἐν ἡμέραις θερισμοῦ πυρῶν καὶ εὗρεν μῆλα μανδραγόρου ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὰ πρὸς Λειαν τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ εἶπεν δὲ Ραχηλ τῇ Λεια δός μοι τῶν μανδραγορῶν τοῦ υἱοῦ σου
15 εἶπεν δὲ Λεια οὐχ ἱκανόν σοι ὅτι ἔλαβες τὸν ἄνδρα μου μὴ καὶ τοὺς μανδραγόρας τοῦ υἱοῦ μου λήμψῃ εἶπεν δὲ Ραχηλ οὐχ οὕτως κοιμηθήτω μετὰ σοῦ τὴν νύκτα ταύτην ἀντὶ τῶν μανδραγορῶν τοῦ υἱοῦ σου
16 εἰσῆλθεν δὲ Ιακωβ ἐξ ἀγροῦ ἑσπέρας καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Λεια εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ καὶ εἶπεν πρός με εἰσελεύσῃ σήμερον μεμίσθωμαι γάρ σε ἀντὶ τῶν μανδραγορῶν τοῦ υἱοῦ μου καὶ ἐκοιμήθη με{T'} αὐτῆς τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην
17 καὶ ἐπήκουσεν ὁ θεὸς Λειας καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτεκεν τῷ Ιακωβ υἱὸν πέμπτον
18 καὶ εἶπεν Λεια ἔδωκεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν μισθόν μου ἀν{Q'} οὗ ἔδωκα τὴν παιδίσκην μου τῷ ἀνδρί μου καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ισσαχαρ ὅ ἐστιν Μισθός
19 καὶ συνέλαβεν ἔτι Λεια καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν ἕκτον τῷ Ιακωβ
20 καὶ εἶπεν Λεια δεδώρηταί μοι ὁ θεὸς δῶρον καλόν ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ αἱρετιεῖ με ὁ ἀνήρ μου ἔτεκον γὰρ αὐτῷ υἱοὺς ἕξ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ζαβουλων
21 καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἔτεκεν θυγατέρα καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς Δινα
22 ἐμνήσθη δὲ ὁ θεὸς τῆς Ραχηλ καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτῆς ὁ θεὸς καὶ ἀνέῳξεν αὐτῆς τὴν μήτραν
23 καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτεκεν τῷ Ιακωβ υἱόν εἶπεν δὲ Ραχηλ ἀφεῖλεν ὁ θεός μου τὸ ὄνειδος
24 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ιωσηφ λέγουσα προσθέτω ὁ θεός μοι υἱὸν ἕτερον

25 ἐγένετο δὲ ὡς ἔτεκεν Ραχηλ τὸν Ιωσηφ εἶπεν Ιακωβ τῷ Λαβαν ἀπόστειλόν με ἵνα ἀπέλθω εἰς τὸν τόπον μου καὶ εἰς τὴν γῆν μου
26 ἀπόδος τὰς γυναῖκάς μου καὶ τὰ παιδία περὶ ὧν δεδούλευκά σοι ἵνα ἀπέλθω σὺ γὰρ γινώσκεις τὴν δουλείαν ἣν δεδούλευκά σοι
27 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Λαβαν εἰ εὗρον χάριν ἐναντίον σου οἰωνισάμην ἄν εὐλόγησεν γάρ με ὁ θεὸς τῇ σῇ εἰσόδῳ
28 διάστειλον τὸν μισθόν σου πρός με καὶ δώσω
29 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Ιακωβ σὺ γινώσκεις ἃ δεδούλευκά σοι καὶ ὅσα ἦν κτήνη σου με{T'} ἐμοῦ
30 μικρὰ γὰρ ἦν ὅσα σοι ἦν ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ καὶ ηὐξήθη εἰς πλῆθος καὶ ηὐλόγησέν σε κύριος ἐπὶ τῷ ποδί μου νῦν οὖν πότε ποιήσω κἀγὼ ἐμαυτῷ οἶκον
31 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Λαβαν τί σοι δώσω εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Ιακωβ οὐ δώσεις μοι οὐθέν ἐὰν ποιήσῃς μοι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο πάλιν ποιμανῶ τὰ πρόβατά σου καὶ φυλάξω
32 παρελθάτω πάντα τὰ πρόβατά σου σήμερον καὶ διαχώρισον ἐκεῖθεν πᾶν πρόβατον φαιὸν ἐν τοῖς ἀρνάσιν καὶ πᾶν διάλευκον καὶ ῥαντὸν ἐν ταῖς αἰξίν ἔσται μοι μισθός
33 καὶ ἐπακούσεταί μοι ἡ δικαιοσύνη μου ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ αὔριον ὅτι ἐστὶν ὁ μισθός μου ἐνώπιόν σου πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν μὴ ᾖ ῥαντὸν καὶ διάλευκον ἐν ταῖς αἰξὶν καὶ φαιὸν ἐν τοῖς ἀρνάσιν κεκλεμμένον ἔσται πα{R'} ἐμοί
34 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Λαβαν ἔστω κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου
35 καὶ διέστειλεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τοὺς τράγους τοὺς ῥαντοὺς καὶ τοὺς διαλεύκους καὶ πάσας τὰς αἶγας τὰς ῥαντὰς καὶ τὰς διαλεύκους καὶ πᾶν ὃ ἦν λευκὸν ἐν αὐτοῖς καὶ πᾶν ὃ ἦν φαιὸν ἐν τοῖς ἀρνάσιν καὶ ἔδωκεν διὰ χειρὸς τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ
36 καὶ ἀπέστησεν ὁδὸν τριῶν ἡμερῶν ἀνὰ μέσον αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Ιακωβ Ιακωβ δὲ ἐποίμαινεν τὰ πρόβατα Λαβαν τὰ ὑπολειφθέντα

37 ἔλαβεν δὲ ἑαυτῷ Ιακωβ ῥάβδον στυρακίνην χλωρὰν καὶ καρυίνην καὶ πλατάνου καὶ ἐλέπισεν αὐτὰς Ιακωβ λεπίσματα λευκὰ περισύρων τὸ χλωρόν ἐφαίνετο δὲ ἐπὶ ταῖς ῥάβδοις τὸ λευκόν ὃ ἐλέπισεν ποικίλον
38 καὶ παρέθηκεν τὰς ῥάβδους ἃς ἐλέπισεν ἐν ταῖς ληνοῖς τῶν ποτιστηρίων τοῦ ὕδατος ἵνα ὡς ἂν ἔλθωσιν τὰ πρόβατα πιεῖν ἐνώπιον τῶν ῥάβδων ἐλθόντων αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ πιεῖν
39 ἐγκισσήσωσιν τὰ πρόβατα εἰς τὰς ῥάβδους καὶ ἔτικτον τὰ πρόβατα διάλευκα καὶ ποικίλα καὶ σποδοειδῆ ῥαντά

40 τοὺς δὲ ἀμνοὺς διέστειλεν Ιακωβ καὶ ἔστησεν ἐναντίον τῶν προβάτων κριὸν διάλευκον καὶ πᾶν ποικίλον ἐν τοῖς ἀμνοῖς καὶ διεχώρισεν ἑαυτῷ ποίμνια κα{Q'} ἑαυτὸν καὶ οὐκ ἔμιξεν αὐτὰ εἰς τὰ πρόβατα Λαβαν
41 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ᾧ ἐνεκίσσησεν τὰ πρόβατα ἐν γαστρὶ λαμβάνοντα ἔθηκεν Ιακωβ τὰς ῥάβδους ἐναντίον τῶν προβάτων ἐν ταῖς ληνοῖς τοῦ ἐγκισσῆσαι αὐτὰ κατὰ τὰς ῥάβδους
42 ἡνίκα {D'} ἂν ἔτεκον τὰ πρόβατα οὐκ ἐτίθει ἐγένετο δὲ τὰ ἄσημα τοῦ Λαβαν τὰ δὲ ἐπίσημα τοῦ Ιακωβ
43 καὶ ἐπλούτησεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος σφόδρα σφόδρα καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ κτήνη πολλὰ καὶ βόες καὶ παῖδες καὶ παιδίσκαι καὶ κάμηλοι καὶ ὄνοι
