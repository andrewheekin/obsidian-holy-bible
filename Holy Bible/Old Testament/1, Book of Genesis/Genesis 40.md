# Book of Genesis 40 (RSVCE)

### The Dreams of Two Prisoners
1 Some time after this, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.
2 And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief baker,
3 and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.
4 The captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he waited on them; and they continued for some time in custody.
5 And one night they both dreamed—the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison—each his own dream, and each dream with its own meaning.
6 When Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, they were troubled.
7 So he asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, “Why are your faces downcast today?”
8 They said to him, “We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.” And Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, I pray you.”
9 So the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream there was a vine before me,
10 and on the vine there were three branches; as soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.
11 Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”
12 Then Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;
13 within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you shall place Pharaoh’s cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his butler.
14 But remember me, when it is well with you, and do me the kindness, I pray you, to make mention of me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.
15 For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.”
16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,
17 and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.”
18 And Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;
19 within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—from you!—and hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat the flesh from you.”
20 On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
21 He restored the chief butler to his butlership, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand;
22 but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
23 Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.


# Liber Genesis 40 (Latin Vulgate)

1 His ita gestis, accidit ut peccarent duo eunuchi, pincerna regis Ægypti, et pistor, domino suo.
2 Iratusque contra eos Pharao (nam alter pincernis præerat, alter pistoribus),
3 misit eos in carcerem principis militum, in quo erat vinctus et Joseph.
4 At custos carceris tradidit eos Joseph, qui et ministrabat eis: aliquantulum temporis fluxerat, et illi in custodia tenebantur.
5 Videruntque ambo somnium nocte una, juxta interpretationem congruam sibi:
6 ad quos cum introisset Joseph mane, et vidisset eos tristes,
7 sciscitatus est eos, dicens: Cur tristior est hodie solito facies vestra?
8 Qui responderunt: Somnium vidimus, et non est qui interpretetur nobis. Dixitque ad eos Joseph: Numquid non Dei est interpretatio? referte mihi quid videritis.

9 Narravit prior, præpositus pincernarum, somnium suum: Videbam coram me vitem,
10 in qua erant tres propagines, crescere paulatim in gemmas, et post flores uvas maturescere:
11 calicemque Pharaonis in manu mea: tuli ergo uvas, et expressi in calicem quem tenebam, et tradidi poculum Pharaoni.
12 Respondit Joseph: Hæc est interpretatio somnii: tres propagines, tres adhuc dies sunt:
13 post quos recordabitur Pharao ministerii tui, et restituet te in gradum pristinum: dabisque ei calicem juxta officium tuum, sicut ante facere consueveras.
14 Tantum memento mei, cum bene tibi fuerit, et facias mecum misericordiam: ut suggeras Pharaoni ut educat me de isto carcere:
15 quia furto sublatus sum de terra Hebræorum, et hic innocens in lacum missus sum.

16 Videns pistorum magister quod prudenter somnium dissolvisset, ait: Et ego vidi somnium: quod tria canistra farinæ haberem super caput meum:
17 et in uno canistro quod erat excelsius, portare me omnes cibos qui fiunt arte pistoria, avesque comedere ex eo.
18 Respondit Joseph: Hæc est interpretatio somnii: tria canistra, tres adhuc dies sunt:
19 post quos auferet Pharao caput tuum, ac suspendet te in cruce, et lacerabunt volucres carnes tuas.

20 Exinde dies tertius natalitius Pharaonis erat: qui faciens grande convivium pueris suis, recordatus est inter epulas magistri pincernarum, et pistorum principis.
21 Restituitque alterum in locum suum, ut porrigeret ei poculum:
22 alterum suspendit in patibulo, ut conjectoris veritas probaretur.
23 Et tamen succedentibus prosperis, præpositus pincernarum oblitus est interpretis sui.


# Γένεσις 40 (Septuagint)

1 ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα ἥμαρτεν ὁ ἀρχιοινοχόος τοῦ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου καὶ ὁ ἀρχισιτοποιὸς τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτῶν βασιλεῖ Αἰγύπτου
2 καὶ ὠργίσθη Φαραω ἐπὶ τοῖς δυσὶν εὐνούχοις αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῷ ἀρχιοινοχόῳ καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ἀρχισιτοποιῷ
3 καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοὺς ἐν φυλακῇ παρὰ τῷ δεσμοφύλακι εἰς τὸ δεσμωτήριον εἰς τὸν τόπον οὗ Ιωσηφ ἀπῆκτο ἐκεῖ
4 καὶ συνέστησεν ὁ ἀρχιδεσμώτης τῷ Ιωσηφ αὐτούς καὶ παρέστη αὐτοῖς ἦσαν δὲ ἡμέρας ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ
5 καὶ εἶδον ἀμφότεροι ἐνύπνιον ἑκάτερος ἐνύπνιον ἐν μιᾷ νυκτὶ ὅρασις τοῦ ἐνυπνίου αὐτοῦ ὁ ἀρχιοινοχόος καὶ ὁ ἀρχισιτοποιός οἳ ἦσαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Αἰγύπτου οἱ ὄντες ἐν τῷ δεσμωτηρίῳ
6 εἰσῆλθεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ιωσηφ τὸ πρωὶ καὶ εἶδεν αὐτούς καὶ ἦσαν τεταραγμένοι
7 καὶ ἠρώτα τοὺς εὐνούχους Φαραω οἳ ἦσαν με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ παρὰ τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτοῦ λέγων τί ὅτι τὰ πρόσωπα ὑμῶν σκυθρωπὰ σήμερον
8 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν αὐτῷ ἐνύπνιον εἴδομεν καὶ ὁ συγκρίνων οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτό εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ οὐχὶ διὰ τοῦ θεοῦ ἡ διασάφησις αὐτῶν ἐστιν διηγήσασθε οὖν μοι

9 καὶ διηγήσατο ὁ ἀρχιοινοχόος τὸ ἐνύπνιον αὐτοῦ τῷ Ιωσηφ καὶ εἶπεν ἐν τῷ ὕπνῳ μου ἦν ἄμπελος ἐναντίον μου
10 ἐν δὲ τῇ ἀμπέλῳ τρεῖς πυθμένες καὶ αὐτὴ θάλλουσα ἀνενηνοχυῖα βλαστούς πέπειροι οἱ βότρυες σταφυλῆς
11 καὶ τὸ ποτήριον Φαραω ἐν τῇ χειρί μου καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν σταφυλὴν καὶ ἐξέθλιψα αὐτὴν εἰς τὸ ποτήριον καὶ ἔδωκα τὸ ποτήριον εἰς τὰς χεῖρας Φαραω
12 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ιωσηφ τοῦτο ἡ σύγκρισις αὐτοῦ οἱ τρεῖς πυθμένες τρεῖς ἡμέραι εἰσίν
13 ἔτι τρεῖς ἡμέραι καὶ μνησθήσεται Φαραω τῆς ἀρχῆς σου καὶ ἀποκαταστήσει σε ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχιοινοχοΐαν σου καὶ δώσεις τὸ ποτήριον Φαραω εἰς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ κατὰ τὴν ἀρχήν σου τὴν προτέραν ὡς ἦσθα οἰνοχοῶν
14 ἀλλὰ μνήσθητί μου διὰ σεαυτοῦ ὅταν εὖ σοι γένηται καὶ ποιήσεις ἐν ἐμοὶ ἔλεος καὶ μνησθήσῃ περὶ ἐμοῦ Φαραω καὶ ἐξάξεις με ἐκ τοῦ ὀχυρώματος τούτου
15 ὅτι κλοπῇ ἐκλάπην ἐκ γῆς Εβραίων καὶ ὧδε οὐκ ἐποίησα οὐδέν ἀλ{L'} ἐνέβαλόν με εἰς τὸν λάκκον τοῦτον

16 καὶ εἶδεν ὁ ἀρχισιτοποιὸς ὅτι ὀρθῶς συνέκρινεν καὶ εἶπεν τῷ Ιωσηφ κἀγὼ εἶδον ἐνύπνιον καὶ ᾤμην τρία κανᾶ χονδριτῶν αἴρειν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς μου
17 ἐν δὲ τῷ κανῷ τῷ ἐπάνω ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν γενῶν ὧν ὁ βασιλεὺς Φαραω ἐσθίει ἔργον σιτοποιοῦ καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατήσθιεν αὐτὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ κανοῦ τοῦ ἐπάνω τῆς κεφαλῆς μου
18 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ιωσηφ εἶπεν αὐτῷ αὕτη ἡ σύγκρισις αὐτοῦ τὰ τρία κανᾶ τρεῖς ἡμέραι εἰσίν
19 ἔτι τριῶν ἡμερῶν ἀφελεῖ Φαραω τὴν κεφαλήν σου ἀπὸ σοῦ καὶ κρεμάσει σε ἐπὶ ξύλου καὶ φάγεται τὰ ὄρνεα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τὰς σάρκας σου ἀπὸ σοῦ

20 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρα γενέσεως ἦν Φαραω καὶ ἐποίει πότον πᾶσι τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐμνήσθη τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ ἀρχιοινοχόου καὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ ἀρχισιτοποιοῦ ἐν μέσῳ τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ
21 καὶ ἀπεκατέστησεν τὸν ἀρχιοινοχόον ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔδωκεν τὸ ποτήριον εἰς τὴν χεῖρα Φαραω
22 τὸν δὲ ἀρχισιτοποιὸν ἐκρέμασεν καθὰ συνέκρινεν αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ
23 οὐκ ἐμνήσθη δὲ ὁ ἀρχιοινοχόος τοῦ Ιωσηφ ἀλλὰ ἐπελάθετο αὐτοῦ
