# Book of Genesis 48 (RSVCE)

### Jacob Blesses Joseph’s Sons
1 After this Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is ill”; so he took with him his two sons, Manasʹseh and Eʹphraim.
2 And it was told to Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to you”; then Israel summoned his strength, and sat up in bed.
3 And Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,
4 and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.’
5 And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Eʹphraim and Manasʹseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.
6 And the offspring born to you after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
7 For when I came from Paddan, Rachel to my sorrow died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”
8 When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?”
9 Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Bring them to me, I pray you, that I may bless them.”
10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him; and he kissed them and embraced them.
11 And Israel said to Joseph, “I had not thought to see your face; and lo, God has let me see your children also.”
12 Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
13 And Joseph took them both, Eʹphraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasʹseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near him.
14 And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of Eʹphraim, who was the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manasʹseh, crossing his hands, for Manasʹseh was the first-born.
15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has led me all my life long to this day,
16 the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and in them let my name be perpetuated, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”
17 When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Eʹphraim, it displeased him; and he took his father’s hand, to remove it from Eʹphraim’s head to Manasʹseh’s head.
18 And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father; for this one is the first-born; put your right hand upon his head.”
19 But his father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.”
20 So he blessed them that day, saying, “By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, ‘God make you as Eʹphraim and as Manasʹseh’ ”; and thus he put Eʹphraim before Manasʹseh.
21 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.
22 Moreover I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope which I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.”


# Liber Genesis 48 (Latin Vulgate)

1 His ita transactis, nuntiatum est Joseph quod ægrotaret pater suus: qui, assumptis duobus filiis Manasse et Ephraim, ire perrexit.
2 Dictumque est seni: Ecce filius tuus Joseph venit ad te. Qui confortatus sedit in lectulo.
3 Et ingresso ad se ait: Deus omnipotens apparuit mihi in Luza, quæ est in terra Chanaan: benedixitque mihi,
4 et ait: Ego te augebo et multiplicabo, et faciam te in turbas populorum: daboque tibi terram hanc, et semini tuo post te in possessionem sempiternam.
5 Duo ergo filii tui, qui nati sunt tibi in terra Ægypti antequam huc venirem ad te, mei erunt: Ephraim et Manasses, sicut Ruben et Simeon reputabuntur mihi.
6 Reliquos autem quos genueris post eos, tui erunt, et nomine fratrum suorum vocabuntur in possessionibus suis.
7 Mihi enim, quando veniebam de Mesopotamia, mortua est Rachel in terra Chanaan in ipso itinere, eratque vernum tempus: et ingrediebar Ephratam, et sepelivi eam juxta viam Ephratæ, quæ alio nomine appellatur Bethlehem.
8 Videns autem filios ejus dixit ad eum: Qui sunt isti?
9 Respondit: Filii mei sunt, quos donavit mihi Deus in hoc loco. Adduc, inquit, eos ad me, ut benedicam illis.
10 Oculi enim Israël caligabant præ nimia senectute, et clare videre non poterat. Applicitosque ad se, deosculatus et circumplexus eos,
11 dixit ad filium suum: Non sum fraudatus aspectu tuo: insuper ostendit mihi Deus semen tuum.
12 Cumque tulisset eos Joseph de gremio patris, adoravit pronus in terram.
13 Et posuit Ephraim ad dexteram suam, id est, ad sinistram Israël: Manassen vero in sinistra sua, ad dexteram scilicet patris, applicuitque ambos ad eum.
14 Qui extendens manum dexteram, posuit super caput Ephraim minoris fratris: sinistram autem super caput Manasse qui major natu erat, commutans manus.
15 Benedixitque Jacob filiis Joseph, et ait: Deus, in cujus conspectu ambulaverunt patres mei Abraham, et Isaac; Deus qui pascit me ab adolescentia mea usque in præsentem diem:
16 angelus, qui eruit me de cunctis malis, benedicat pueris istis: et invocetur super eos nomen meum, nomina quoque patrum meorum Abraham et Isaac, et crescant in multitudinem super terram.
17 Videns autem Joseph quod posuisset pater suus dexteram manum super caput Ephraim, graviter accepit: et apprehensam manum patris levare conatus est de capite Ephraim, et transferre super caput Manasse.
18 Dixitque ad patrem: Non ita convenit, pater: quia hic est primogenitus, pone dexteram tuam super caput ejus.
19 Qui renuens, ait: Scio, fili mi, scio: et iste quidem erit in populos, et multiplicabitur: sed frater ejus minor, major erit illo: et semen illius crescet in gentes.
20 Benedixitque eis in tempore illo, dicens: In te benedicetur Israël, atque dicetur: Faciat tibi Deus sicut Ephraim, et sicut Manasse. Constituitque Ephraim ante Manassen.
21 Et ait ad Joseph filium suum: En ego morior, et erit Deus vobiscum, reducetque vos ad terram patrum vestrorum.
22 Do tibi partem unam extra fratres tuos, quam tuli de manu Amorrhæi in gladio et arcu meo.

1 ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ιωσηφ ὅτι ὁ πατήρ σου ἐνοχλεῖται καὶ ἀναλαβὼν τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ τὸν Μανασση καὶ τὸν Εφραιμ ἦλθεν πρὸς Ιακωβ
2 ἀπηγγέλη δὲ τῷ Ιακωβ λέγοντες ἰδοὺ ὁ υἱός σου Ιωσηφ ἔρχεται πρὸς σέ καὶ ἐνισχύσας Ισραηλ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην
3 καὶ εἶπεν Ιακωβ τῷ Ιωσηφ ὁ θεός μου ὤφθη μοι ἐν Λουζα ἐν γῇ Χανααν καὶ εὐλόγησέν με
4 καὶ εἶπέν μοι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ αὐξανῶ σε καὶ πληθυνῶ σε καὶ ποιήσω σε εἰς συναγωγὰς ἐθνῶν καὶ δώσω σοι τὴν γῆν ταύτην καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου μετὰ σὲ εἰς κατάσχεσιν αἰώνιον
5 νῦν οὖν οἱ δύο υἱοί σου οἱ γενόμενοί σοι ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ πρὸ τοῦ με ἐλθεῖν πρὸς σὲ εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἐμοί εἰσιν Εφραιμ καὶ Μανασση ὡς Ρουβην καὶ Συμεων ἔσονταί μοι
6 τὰ δὲ ἔκγονα ἃ ἐὰν γεννήσῃς μετὰ ταῦτα σοὶ ἔσονται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν κληθήσονται ἐν τοῖς ἐκείνων κλήροις
7 ἐγὼ δὲ ἡνίκα ἠρχόμην ἐκ Μεσοποταμίας τῆς Συρίας ἀπέθανεν Ραχηλ ἡ μήτηρ σου ἐν γῇ Χανααν ἐγγίζοντός μου κατὰ τὸν ἱππόδρομον χαβραθα τῆς γῆς τοῦ ἐλθεῖν Εφραθα καὶ κατώρυξα αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ ἱπποδρόμου αὕτη ἐστὶν Βαιθλεεμ
8 ἰδὼν δὲ Ισραηλ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ιωσηφ εἶπεν τίνες σοι οὗτοι
9 εἶπεν δὲ Ιωσηφ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ υἱοί μού εἰσιν οὓς ἔδωκέν μοι ὁ θεὸς ἐνταῦθα καὶ εἶπεν Ιακωβ προσάγαγέ μοι αὐτούς ἵνα εὐλογήσω αὐτούς
10 οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ Ισραηλ ἐβαρυώπησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ γήρους καὶ οὐκ ἠδύνατο βλέπειν καὶ ἤγγισεν αὐτοὺς πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ ἐφίλησεν αὐτοὺς καὶ περιέλαβεν αὐτούς
11 καὶ εἶπεν Ισραηλ πρὸς Ιωσηφ ἰδοὺ τοῦ προσώπου σου οὐκ ἐστερήθην καὶ ἰδοὺ ἔδειξέν μοι ὁ θεὸς καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου
12 καὶ ἐξήγαγεν Ιωσηφ αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν γονάτων αὐτοῦ καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
13 λαβὼν δὲ Ιωσηφ τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ τόν τε Εφραιμ ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ ἐξ ἀριστερῶν δὲ Ισραηλ τὸν δὲ Μανασση ἐν τῇ ἀριστερᾷ ἐκ δεξιῶν δὲ Ισραηλ ἤγγισεν αὐτοὺς αὐτῷ
14 ἐκτείνας δὲ Ισραηλ τὴν χεῖρα τὴν δεξιὰν ἐπέβαλεν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Εφραιμ οὗτος δὲ ἦν ὁ νεώτερος καὶ τὴν ἀριστερὰν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Μανασση ἐναλλὰξ τὰς χεῖρας
15 καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεός ᾧ εὐηρέστησαν οἱ πατέρες μου ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ Αβρααμ καὶ Ισαακ ὁ θεὸς ὁ τρέφων με ἐκ νεότητος ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
16 ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ ῥυόμενός με ἐκ πάντων τῶν κακῶν εὐλογήσαι τὰ παιδία ταῦτα καὶ ἐπικληθήσεται ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸ ὄνομά μου καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τῶν πατέρων μου Αβρααμ καὶ Ισαακ καὶ πληθυνθείησαν εἰς πλῆθος πολὺ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
17 ἰδὼν δὲ Ιωσηφ ὅτι ἐπέβαλεν ὁ πατὴρ τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Εφραιμ βαρὺ αὐτῷ κατεφάνη καὶ ἀντελάβετο Ιωσηφ τῆς χειρὸς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἀφελεῖν αὐτὴν ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς Εφραιμ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Μανασση
18 εἶπεν δὲ Ιωσηφ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ οὐχ οὕτως πάτερ οὗτος γὰρ ὁ πρωτότοκος ἐπίθες τὴν δεξιάν σου ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ
19 καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ἀλλὰ εἶπεν οἶδα τέκνον οἶδα καὶ οὗτος ἔσται εἰς λαόν καὶ οὗτος ὑψωθήσεται ἀλλὰ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ὁ νεώτερος μείζων αὐτοῦ ἔσται καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἔσται εἰς πλῆθος ἐθνῶν
20 καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ λέγων ἐν ὑμῖν εὐλογηθήσεται Ισραηλ λέγοντες ποιήσαι σε ὁ θεὸς ὡς Εφραιμ καὶ ὡς Μανασση καὶ ἔθηκεν τὸν Εφραιμ ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Μανασση
21 εἶπεν δὲ Ισραηλ τῷ Ιωσηφ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀποθνῄσκω καὶ ἔσται ὁ θεὸς με{Q'} ὑμῶν καὶ ἀποστρέψει ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν
22 ἐγὼ δὲ δίδωμί σοι Σικιμα ἐξαίρετον ὑπὲρ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου ἣν ἔλαβον ἐκ χειρὸς Αμορραίων ἐν μαχαίρᾳ μου καὶ τόξῳ
