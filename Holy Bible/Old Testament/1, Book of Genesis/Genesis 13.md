# Book of Genesis 13 (RSVCE)

### Abram and Lot Separate
1 So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.
2 Now Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
3 And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
4 to the place where he had made an altar at the first; and there Abram called on the name of theLord.
5 And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,
6 so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together,
7 and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot’s cattle. At that time the Canaanites and the Perʹizzites dwelt in the land.
8 Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are kinsmen.
9 Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.”
10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw that the Jordan valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of theLord, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoʹar; this was before theLorddestroyed Sodom and Gomorʹrah.
11 So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan valley, and Lot journeyed east; thus they separated from each other.
12 Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, while Lot dwelt among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
13 Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against theLord.
14 TheLordsaid to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;
15 for all the land which you see I will give to you and to your descendants for ever.
16 I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your descendants also can be counted.
17 Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.”
18 So Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron; and there he built an altar to theLord.


# Liber Genesis 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Ascendit ergo Abram de Ægypto, ipse et uxor ejus, et omnia quæ habebat, et Lot cum eo, ad australem plagam.
2 Erat autem dives valde in possessione auri et argenti.
3 Reversusque est per iter, quo venerat, a meridie in Bethel, usque ad locum ubi prius fixerat tabernaculum inter Bethel et Hai,
4 in loco altaris quod fecerat prius: et invocavit ibi nomen Domini.
5 Sed et Lot qui erat cum Abram, fuerunt greges ovium, et armenta, et tabernacula.
6 Nec poterat eos capere terra, ut habitarent simul: erat quippe substantia eorum multa, et nequibant habitare communiter.
7 Unde et facta est rixa inter pastores gregum Abram et Lot. Eo autem tempore Chananæus et Pherezæus habitabant in terra illa.
8 Dixit ergo Abram ad Lot: Ne quæso sit jurgium inter me et te, et inter pastores meos et pastores tuos: fratres enim sumus.
9 Ecce universa terra coram te est: recede a me, obsecro: si ad sinistram ieris, ego dexteram tenebo: si tu dexteram elegeris, ego ad sinistram pergam.
10 Elevatis itaque Lot oculis, vidit omnem circa regionem Jordanis, quæ universa irrigabatur antequam subverteret Dominus Sodomam et Gomorrham, sicut paradisus Domini, et sicut Ægyptus venientibus in Segor.
11 Elegitque sibi Lot regionem circa Jordanem, et recessit ab oriente: divisique sunt alterutrum a fratre suo.
12 Abram habitavit in terra Chanaan; Lot vero moratus est in oppidis, quæ erant circa Jordanem, et habitavit in Sodomis.
13 Homines autem Sodomitæ pessimi erant, et peccatores coram Domino nimis.

14 Dixitque Dominus ad Abram, postquam divisus est ab eo Lot: Leva oculos tuos et vide a loco, in quo nunc es, ad aquilonem et meridiem, ad orientem et occidentem.
15 Omnem terram, quam conspicis, tibi dabo, et semini tuo usque in sempiternum.
16 Faciamque semen tuum sicut pulverem terræ: si quis potest hominum numerare pulverem terræ, semen quoque tuum numerare poterit.
17 Surge, et perambula terram in longitudine et in latitudine sua: quia tibi daturus sum eam.
18 Movens igitur tabernaculum suum Abram, venit, et habitavit juxta convallem Mambre, quæ est in Hebron: ædificavitque ibi altare Domino.

1 ἀνέβη δὲ Αβραμ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου αὐτὸς καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ καὶ Λωτ με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἔρημον
2 Αβραμ δὲ ἦν πλούσιος σφόδρα κτήνεσιν καὶ ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσίῳ
3 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὅθεν ἦλθεν εἰς τὴν ἔρημον ἕως Βαιθηλ ἕως τοῦ τόπου οὗ ἦν ἡ σκηνὴ αὐτοῦ τὸ πρότερον ἀνὰ μέσον Βαιθηλ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Αγγαι
4 εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου οὗ ἐποίησεν ἐκεῖ τὴν ἀρχήν καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο ἐκεῖ Αβραμ τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου
5 καὶ Λωτ τῷ συμπορευομένῳ μετὰ Αβραμ ἦν πρόβατα καὶ βόες καὶ σκηναί
6 καὶ οὐκ ἐχώρει αὐτοὺς ἡ γῆ κατοικεῖν ἅμα ὅτι ἦν τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῶν πολλά καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο κατοικεῖν ἅμα
7 καὶ ἐγένετο μάχη ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ποιμένων τῶν κτηνῶν τοῦ Αβραμ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ποιμένων τῶν κτηνῶν τοῦ Λωτ οἱ δὲ Χαναναῖοι καὶ οἱ Φερεζαῖοι τότε κατῴκουν τὴν γῆν
8 εἶπεν δὲ Αβραμ τῷ Λωτ μὴ ἔστω μάχη ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ποιμένων μου καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ποιμένων σου ὅτι ἄνθρωποι ἀδελφοὶ ἡμεῖς ἐσμεν
9 οὐκ ἰδοὺ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ ἐναντίον σού ἐστιν διαχωρίσθητι ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ εἰ σὺ εἰς ἀριστερά ἐγὼ εἰς δεξιά εἰ δὲ σὺ εἰς δεξιά ἐγὼ εἰς ἀριστερά
10 καὶ ἐπάρας Λωτ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ εἶδεν πᾶσαν τὴν περίχωρον τοῦ Ιορδάνου ὅτι πᾶσα ἦν ποτιζομένη πρὸ τοῦ καταστρέψαι τὸν θεὸν Σοδομα καὶ Γομορρα ὡς ὁ παράδεισος τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ὡς ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου ἕως ἐλθεῖν εἰς Ζογορα
11 καὶ ἐξελέξατο ἑαυτῷ Λωτ πᾶσαν τὴν περίχωρον τοῦ Ιορδάνου καὶ ἀπῆρεν Λωτ ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν καὶ διεχωρίσθησαν ἕκαστος ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ
12 Αβραμ δὲ κατῴκησεν ἐν γῇ Χανααν Λωτ δὲ κατῴκησεν ἐν πόλει τῶν περιχώρων καὶ ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν Σοδομοις
13 οἱ δὲ ἄνθρωποι οἱ ἐν Σοδομοις πονηροὶ καὶ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἐναντίον τοῦ θεοῦ σφόδρα

14 ὁ δὲ θεὸς εἶπεν τῷ Αβραμ μετὰ τὸ διαχωρισθῆναι τὸν Λωτ ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ ἀναβλέψας τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου ἰδὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ τόπου οὗ νῦν σὺ εἶ πρὸς βορρᾶν καὶ λίβα καὶ ἀνατολὰς καὶ θάλασσαν
15 ὅτι πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἣν σὺ ὁρᾷς σοὶ δώσω αὐτὴν καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος
16 καὶ ποιήσω τὸ σπέρμα σου ὡς τὴν ἄμμον τῆς γῆς εἰ δύναταί τις ἐξαριθμῆσαι τὴν ἄμμον τῆς γῆς καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου ἐξαριθμηθήσεται
17 ἀναστὰς διόδευσον τὴν γῆν εἴς τε τὸ μῆκος αὐτῆς καὶ εἰς τὸ πλάτος ὅτι σοὶ δώσω αὐτήν
18 καὶ ἀποσκηνώσας Αβραμ ἐλθὼν κατῴκησεν παρὰ τὴν δρῦν τὴν Μαμβρη ἣ ἦν ἐν Χεβρων καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον κυρίῳ
