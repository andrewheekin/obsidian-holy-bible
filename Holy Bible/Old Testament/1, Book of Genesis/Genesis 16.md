# Book of Genesis 16 (RSVCE)

### The Birth of Ishmael
1 Now Sarʹai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children. She had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar;
2 and Sarʹai said to Abram, “Behold now, theLordhas prevented me from bearing children; go in to my maid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarʹai.
3 So, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarʹai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.
4 And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.
5 And Sarʹai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my maid to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May theLordjudge between you and me!”
6 But Abram said to Sarʹai, “Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarʹai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.
7 The angel of theLordfound her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.
8 And he said, “Hagar, maid of Sarʹai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarʹai.”
9 The angel of theLordsaid to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit to her.”
10 The angel of theLordalso said to her, “I will so greatly multiply your descendants that they cannot be numbered for multitude.”
11 And the angel of theLordsaid to her, “Behold, you are with child, and shall bear a son; you shall call his name Ishʹmael; because theLordhas given heed to your affliction.
12 He shall be a wild ass of a man, his hand against every man and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.”
13 So she called the name of theLordwho spoke to her, “Thou art a God of seeing”; for she said, “Have I really seen God and remained alive after seeing him?”
14 Therefore the well was called Beer-laʹhai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.
15 And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishʹmael.
16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishʹmael to Abram.


# Liber Genesis 16 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Igitur Sarai, uxor Abram, non genuerat liberos: sed habens ancillam ægyptiam nomine Agar,
2 dixit marito suo: Ecce, conclusit me Dominus, ne parerem. Ingredere ad ancillam meam, si forte saltem ex illa suscipiam filios. Cumque ille acquiesceret deprecanti,
3 tulit Agar ægyptiam ancillam suam post annos decem quam habitare cœperant in terra Chanaan: et dedit eam viro suo uxorem.
4 Qui ingressus est ad eam. At illa concepisse se videns, despexit dominam suam.
5 Dixitque Sarai ad Abram: Inique agis contra me: ego dedi ancillam meam in sinum tuum, quæ videns quod conceperit, despectui me habet: judicet Dominus inter me et te.
6 Cui respondens Abram: Ecce, ait, ancilla tua in manu tua est, utere ea ut libet. Affligente igitur eam Sarai, fugam iniit.

7 Cumque invenisset eam angelus Domini juxta fontem aquæ in solitudine, qui est in via Sur in deserto,
8 dixit ad illam: Agar ancilla Sarai, unde venis? et quo vadis? Quæ respondit: A facie Sarai dominæ meæ ego fugio.
9 Dixitque ei angelus Domini: Revertere ad dominam tuam, et humiliare sub manu illius.
10 Et rursum: Multiplicans, inquit, multiplicabo semen tuum, et non numerabitur præ multitudine.
11 Ac deinceps: Ecce, ait, concepisti, et paries filium: vocabisque nomen ejus Ismaël, eo quod audierit Dominus afflictionem tuam.
12 Hic erit ferus homo: manus ejus contra omnes, et manus omnium contra eum: et e regione universorum fratrum suorum figet tabernacula.
13 Vocavit autem nomen Domini qui loquebatur ad eam: Tu Deus qui vidisti me. Dixit enim: Profecto hic vidi posteriora videntis me.
14 Propterea appellavit puteum illum Puteum viventis et videntis me. Ipse est inter Cades et Barad.
15 Peperitque Agar Abræ filium: qui vocavit nomen ejus Ismaël.
16 Octoginta et sex annorum erat Abram quando peperit ei Agar Ismaëlem.

1 Σαρα δὲ ἡ γυνὴ Αβραμ οὐκ ἔτικτεν αὐτῷ ἦν δὲ αὐτῇ παιδίσκη Αἰγυπτία ᾗ ὄνομα Αγαρ
2 εἶπεν δὲ Σαρα πρὸς Αβραμ ἰδοὺ συνέκλεισέν με κύριος τοῦ μὴ τίκτειν εἴσελθε οὖν πρὸς τὴν παιδίσκην μου ἵνα τεκνοποιήσῃς ἐξ αὐτῆς ὑπήκουσεν δὲ Αβραμ τῆς φωνῆς Σαρας
3 καὶ λαβοῦσα Σαρα ἡ γυνὴ Αβραμ Αγαρ τὴν Αἰγυπτίαν τὴν ἑαυτῆς παιδίσκην μετὰ δέκα ἔτη τοῦ οἰκῆσαι Αβραμ ἐν γῇ Χανααν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν Αβραμ τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς αὐτῷ γυναῖκα
4 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς Αγαρ καὶ συνέλαβεν καὶ εἶδεν ὅτι ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχει καὶ ἠτιμάσθη ἡ κυρία ἐναντίον αὐτῆς
5 εἶπεν δὲ Σαρα πρὸς Αβραμ ἀδικοῦμαι ἐκ σοῦ ἐγὼ δέδωκα τὴν παιδίσκην μου εἰς τὸν κόλπον σου ἰδοῦσα δὲ ὅτι ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχει ἠτιμάσθην ἐναντίον αὐτῆς κρίναι ὁ θεὸς ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ
6 εἶπεν δὲ Αβραμ πρὸς Σαραν ἰδοὺ ἡ παιδίσκη σου ἐν ταῖς χερσίν σου χρῶ αὐτῇ ὡς ἄν σοι ἀρεστὸν ᾖ καὶ ἐκάκωσεν αὐτὴν Σαρα καὶ ἀπέδρα ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῆς

7 εὗρεν δὲ αὐτὴν ἄγγελος κυρίου ἐπὶ τῆς πηγῆς τοῦ ὕδατος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐπὶ τῆς πηγῆς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ Σουρ
8 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου Αγαρ παιδίσκη Σαρας πόθεν ἔρχῃ καὶ ποῦ πορεύῃ καὶ εἶπεν ἀπὸ προσώπου Σαρας τῆς κυρίας μου ἐγὼ ἀποδιδράσκω
9 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῇ ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου ἀποστράφητι πρὸς τὴν κυρίαν σου καὶ ταπεινώθητι ὑπὸ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς
10 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου πληθύνων πληθυνῶ τὸ σπέρμα σου καὶ οὐκ ἀριθμηθήσεται ἀπὸ τοῦ πλήθους
11 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου ἰδοὺ σὺ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχεις καὶ τέξῃ υἱὸν καὶ καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ισμαηλ ὅτι ἐπήκουσεν κύριος τῇ ταπεινώσει σου
12 οὗτος ἔσται ἄγροικος ἄνθρωπος αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πάντας καὶ αἱ χεῖρες πάντων ἐ{P'} αὐτόν καὶ κατὰ πρόσωπον πάντων τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ κατοικήσει
13 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Αγαρ τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου τοῦ λαλοῦντος πρὸς αὐτήν σὺ ὁ θεὸς ὁ ἐπιδών με ὅτι εἶπεν καὶ γὰρ ἐνώπιον εἶδον ὀφθέντα μοι
14 ἕνεκεν τούτου ἐκάλεσεν τὸ φρέαρ Φρέαρ οὗ ἐνώπιον εἶδον ἰδοὺ ἀνὰ μέσον Καδης καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Βαραδ
15 καὶ ἔτεκεν Αγαρ τῷ Αβραμ υἱόν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Αβραμ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ ὃν ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ Αγαρ Ισμαηλ
16 Αβραμ δὲ ἦν ὀγδοήκοντα ἓξ ἐτῶν ἡνίκα ἔτεκεν Αγαρ τὸν Ισμαηλ τῷ Αβραμ
