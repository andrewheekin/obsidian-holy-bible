# Book of Genesis 39 (RSVCE)

### Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife
1 Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and Potʹi-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishʹmaelites who had brought him down there.
2 TheLordwas with Joseph, and he became a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian,
3 and his master saw that theLordwas with him, and that theLordcaused all that he did to prosper in his hands.
4 So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had.
5 From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had theLordblessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; the blessing of theLordwas upon all that he had, in house and field.
6 So he left all that he had in Joseph’s charge; and having him he had no concern for anything but the food which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome and good-looking.
7 And after a time his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and said, “Lie with me.”
8 But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Lo, having me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my hand;
9 he is not greater in this house than I am; nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife; how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”
10 And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie with her or to be with her.
11 But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house,
12 she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and got out of the house.
13 And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled out of the house,
14 she called to the men of her household and said to them, “See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to insult us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice;
15 and when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled and got out of the house.”
16 Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home,
17 and she told him the same story, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to insult me;
18 but as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out of the house.”
19 When his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, “This is the way your servant treated me,” his anger was kindled.
20 And Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.
21 But theLordwas with Joseph and showed him steadfast love, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s care all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatever was done there, he was the doer of it;
23 the keeper of the prison paid no heed to anything that was in Joseph’s care, because theLordwas with him; and whatever he did, theLordmade it prosper.


# Liber Genesis 39 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Igitur Joseph ductus est in Ægyptum, emitque eum Putiphar eunuchus Pharaonis, princeps exercitus, vir ægyptius, de manu Ismaëlitarum, a quibus perductus erat.
2 Fuitque Dominus cum eo, et erat vir in cunctis prospere agens: habitavitque in domo domini sui,
3 qui optime noverat Dominum esse cum eo, et omnia, quæ gerebat, ab eo dirigi in manu illius.
4 Invenitque Joseph gratiam coram domino suo, et ministrabat ei: a quo præpositus omnibus gubernabat creditam sibi domum, et universa quæ ei tradita fuerant:
5 benedixitque Dominus domui Ægyptii propter Joseph, et multiplicavit tam in ædibus quam in agris cunctam ejus substantiam:
6 nec quidquam aliud noverat, nisi panem quo vescebatur. Erat autem Joseph pulchra facie, et decorus aspectu.

7 Post multos itaque dies injecit domina sua oculos suos in Joseph, et ait: Dormi mecum.
8 Qui nequaquam acquiescens operi nefario, dixit ad eam: Ecce dominus meus, omnibus mihi traditis, ignorat quid habeat in domo sua:
9 nec quidquam est quod non in mea sit potestate, vel non tradiderit mihi, præter te, quæ uxor ejus es: quomodo ergo possum hoc malum facere, et peccare in Deum meum?
10 Hujuscemodi verbis per singulos dies, et mulier molesta erat adolescenti: et ille recusabat stuprum.
11 Accidit autem quadam die ut intraret Joseph domum, et operis quippiam absque arbitris faceret:
12 et illa, apprehensa lacinia vestimenti ejus, diceret: Dormi mecum. Qui relicto in manu ejus pallio fugit, et egressus est foras.

13 Cumque vidisset mulier vestem in manibus suis, et se esse contemptam,
14 vocavit ad se homines domus suæ, et ait ad eos: En introduxit virum hebræum, ut illuderet nobis: ingressus est ad me, ut coiret mecum: cumque ego succlamassem,
15 et audisset vocem meam, reliquit pallium quod tenebam, et fugit foras.
16 In argumentum ergo fidei retentum pallium ostendit marito revertenti domum,
17 et ait: Ingressus est ad me servus hebræus quem adduxisti, ut illuderet mihi:
18 cumque audisset me clamare, reliquit pallium quod tenebam, et fugit foras.
19 His auditis dominus, et nimium credulus verbis conjugis, iratus est valde:
20 tradiditque Joseph in carcerem, ubi vincti regis custodiebantur, et erat ibi clausus.
21 Fuit autem Dominus cum Joseph, et misertus illius dedit ei gratiam in conspectu principis carceris.
22 Qui tradidit in manu illius universos vinctos qui in custodia tenebantur: et quidquid fiebat, sub ipso erat.
23 Nec noverat aliquid, cunctis ei creditis: Dominus enim erat cum illo, et omnia opera ejus dirigebat.

1 Ιωσηφ δὲ κατήχθη εἰς Αἴγυπτον καὶ ἐκτήσατο αὐτὸν Πετεφρης ὁ εὐνοῦχος Φαραω ἀρχιμάγειρος ἀνὴρ Αἰγύπτιος ἐκ χειρὸς Ισμαηλιτῶν οἳ κατήγαγον αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ
2 καὶ ἦν κύριος μετὰ Ιωσηφ καὶ ἦν ἀνὴρ ἐπιτυγχάνων καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ παρὰ τῷ κυρίῳ τῷ Αἰγυπτίῳ
3 ᾔδει δὲ ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ ὅτι κύριος με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ὅσα ἂν ποιῇ κύριος εὐοδοῖ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ
4 καὶ εὗρεν Ιωσηφ χάριν ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ εὐηρέστει δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτῷ ἔδωκεν διὰ χειρὸς Ιωσηφ
5 ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὸ κατασταθῆναι αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτῷ καὶ ηὐλόγησεν κύριος τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Αἰγυπτίου διὰ Ιωσηφ καὶ ἐγενήθη εὐλογία κυρίου ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς ὑπάρχουσιν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ
6 καὶ ἐπέτρεψεν πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτῷ εἰς χεῖρας Ιωσηφ καὶ οὐκ ᾔδει τῶν κα{Q'} ἑαυτὸν οὐδὲν πλὴν τοῦ ἄρτου οὗ ἤσθιεν αὐτός καὶ ἦν Ιωσηφ καλὸς τῷ εἴδει καὶ ὡραῖος τῇ ὄψει σφόδρα

7 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα καὶ ἐπέβαλεν ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῆς ἐπὶ Ιωσηφ καὶ εἶπεν κοιμήθητι με{T'} ἐμοῦ
8 ὁ δὲ οὐκ ἤθελεν εἶπεν δὲ τῇ γυναικὶ τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ εἰ ὁ κύριός μου οὐ γινώσκει δ{I'} ἐμὲ οὐδὲν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν αὐτῷ ἔδωκεν εἰς τὰς χεῖράς μου
9 καὶ οὐχ ὑπερέχει ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ ταύτῃ οὐθὲν ἐμοῦ οὐδὲ ὑπεξῄρηται ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ οὐδὲν πλὴν σοῦ διὰ τὸ σὲ γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ εἶναι καὶ πῶς ποιήσω τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ πονηρὸν τοῦτο καὶ ἁμαρτήσομαι ἐναντίον τοῦ θεοῦ
10 ἡνίκα δὲ ἐλάλει τῷ Ιωσηφ ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουσεν αὐτῇ καθεύδειν με{T'} αὐτῆς τοῦ συγγενέσθαι αὐτῇ
11 ἐγένετο δὲ τοιαύτη τις ἡμέρα εἰσῆλθεν Ιωσηφ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ποιεῖν τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐθεὶς ἦν τῶν ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ ἔσω
12 καὶ ἐπεσπάσατο αὐτὸν τῶν ἱματίων λέγουσα κοιμήθητι με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ καταλιπὼν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῆς ἔφυγεν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἔξω

13 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδεν ὅτι κατέλιπεν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῆς καὶ ἔφυγεν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἔξω
14 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τοὺς ὄντας ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς λέγουσα ἴδετε εἰσήγαγεν ἡμῖν παῖδα Εβραῖον ἐμπαίζειν ἡμῖν εἰσῆλθεν πρός με λέγων κοιμήθητι με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ ἐβόησα φωνῇ μεγάλῃ
15 ἐν δὲ τῷ ἀκοῦσαι αὐτὸν ὅτι ὕψωσα τὴν φωνήν μου καὶ ἐβόησα καταλιπὼν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ πα{R'} ἐμοὶ ἔφυγεν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἔξω
16 καὶ καταλιμπάνει τὰ ἱμάτια πα{R'} ἑαυτῇ ἕως ἦλθεν ὁ κύριος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα λέγουσα εἰσῆλθεν πρός με ὁ παῖς ὁ Εβραῖος ὃν εἰσήγαγες πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἐμπαῖξαί μοι καὶ εἶπέν μοι κοιμηθήσομαι μετὰ σοῦ
18 ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν ὅτι ὕψωσα τὴν φωνήν μου καὶ ἐβόησα κατέλιπεν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ πα{R'} ἐμοὶ καὶ ἔφυγεν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἔξω
19 ἐγένετο δὲ ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ τὰ ῥήματα τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ ὅσα ἐλάλησεν πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγουσα οὕτως ἐποίησέν μοι ὁ παῖς σου καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ
20 καὶ λαβὼν ὁ κύριος Ιωσηφ ἐνέβαλεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ ὀχύρωμα εἰς τὸν τόπον ἐν ᾧ οἱ δεσμῶται τοῦ βασιλέως κατέχονται ἐκεῖ ἐν τῷ ὀχυρώματι
21 καὶ ἦν κύριος μετὰ Ιωσηφ καὶ κατέχεεν αὐτοῦ ἔλεος καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ χάριν ἐναντίον τοῦ ἀρχιδεσμοφύλακος
22 καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ ἀρχιδεσμοφύλαξ τὸ δεσμωτήριον διὰ χειρὸς Ιωσηφ καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀπηγμένους ὅσοι ἐν τῷ δεσμωτηρίῳ καὶ πάντα ὅσα ποιοῦσιν ἐκεῖ
23 οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀρχιδεσμοφύλαξ τοῦ δεσμωτηρίου γινώσκων δ{I'} αὐτὸν οὐθέν πάντα γὰρ ἦν διὰ χειρὸς Ιωσηφ διὰ τὸ τὸν κύριον με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἶναι καὶ ὅσα αὐτὸς ἐποίει κύριος εὐώδου ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ
