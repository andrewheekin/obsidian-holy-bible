# Book of Genesis 29 (RSVCE)

### Jacob Meets Rachel
1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the people of the east.
2 As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and lo, three flocks of sheep lying beside it; for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well’s mouth was large,
3 and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place upon the mouth of the well.
4 Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where do you come from?” They said, “We are from Haran.”
5 He said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.”
6 He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!”
7 He said, “Behold, it is still high day, it is not time for the animals to be gathered together; water the sheep, and go, pasture them.”
8 But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.”
9 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she kept them.
10 Now when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.
11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and wept aloud.
12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s kinsman, and that he was Rebekah’s son; and she ran and told her father.
13 When Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things,
14 and Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh!” And he stayed with him a month.
### Jacob Marries Laban’s Daughters
15 Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?”
16 Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
17 Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful and lovely.
18 Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”
19 Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.”
20 So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.
21 Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.”
22 So Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
23 But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her.
24 (Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her maid.)
25 And in the morning, behold, it was Leah; and Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”
26 Laban said, “It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born.
27 Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.”
28 Jacob did so, and completed her week; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to wife.
29 (Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her maid.)
30 So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.
31 When theLordsaw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.
32 And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, “Because theLordhas looked upon my affliction; surely now my husband will love me.”
33 She conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Because theLordhas heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also”; and she called his name Simeon.
34 Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons”; therefore his name was called Levi.
35 And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “This time I will praise theLord”; therefore she called his name Judah; then she ceased bearing.


# Liber Genesis 29 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Profectus ergo Jacob venit in terram orientalem.
2 Et vidit puteum in agro, tres quoque greges ovium accubantes juxta eum: nam ex illo adaquabantur pecora, et os ejus grandi lapide claudebatur.
3 Morisque erat ut cunctis ovibus congregatis devolverent lapidem, et refectis gregibus rursum super os putei ponerent.
4 Dixitque ad pastores: Fratres, unde estis? Qui responderunt: De Haran.
5 Quos interrogans, Numquid, ait, nostis Laban filium Nachor? Dixerunt: Novimus.
6 Sanusne est? inquit. Valet, inquiunt: et ecce Rachel filia ejus venit cum grege suo.
7 Dixitque Jacob: Adhuc multum diei superest, nec est tempus ut reducantur ad caulas greges: date ante potum ovibus, et sic eas ad pastum reducite.
8 Qui responderunt: Non possumus, donec omnia pecora congregentur, et amoveamus lapidem de ore putei, ut adaquemus greges.
9 Adhuc loquebantur, et ecce Rachel veniebat cum ovibus patris sui: nam gregem ipsa pascebat.
10 Quam cum vidisset Jacob, et sciret consobrinam suam, ovesque Laban avunculi sui, amovit lapidem quo puteus claudebatur.
11 Et adaquato grege, osculatus est eam: et elevata voce flevit,
12 et indicavit ei quod frater esset patris sui, et filius Rebeccæ: at illa festinans nuntiavit patri suo.

13 Qui cum audisset venisse Jacob filium sororis suæ, cucurrit obviam ei: complexusque eum, et in oscula ruens, duxit in domum suam. Auditis autem causis itineris,
14 respondit: Os meum es, et caro mea. Et postquam impleti sunt dies mensis unius,
15 dixit ei: Num quia frater meus es, gratis servies mihi? dic quid mercedis accipias.
16 Habebat vero duas filias: nomen majoris Lia, minor vero appellabatur Rachel.
17 Sed Lia lippis erat oculis: Rachel decora facie, et venusto aspectu.
18 Quam diligens Jacob, ait: Serviam tibi pro Rachel filia tua minore, septem annis.
19 Respondit Laban: Melius est ut tibi eam dem quam alteri viro: mane apud me.
20 Servivit ergo Jacob pro Rachel septem annis: et videbantur illi pauci dies præ amoris magnitudine.

21 Dixitque ad Laban: Da mihi uxorem meam: quia jam tempus impletum est, ut ingrediar ad illam.
22 Qui vocatis multis amicorum turbis ad convivium, fecit nuptias.
23 Et vespere Liam filiam suam introduxit ad eum,
24 dans ancillam filiæ, Zelpham nomine. Ad quam cum ex more Jacob fuisset ingressus, facto mane vidit Liam:
25 et dixit ad socerum suum: Quid est quod facere voluisti? nonne pro Rachel servivi tibi? quare imposuisti mihi?
26 Respondit Laban: Non est in loco nostro consuetudinis, ut minores ante tradamus ad nuptias.
27 Imple hebdomadam dierum hujus copulæ: et hanc quoque dabo tibi pro opere quo serviturus es mihi septem annis aliis.
28 Acquievit placito: et hebdomada transacta, Rachel duxit uxorem:
29 cui pater servam Balam tradiderat.
30 Tandemque potitus optatis nuptiis, amorem sequentis priori prætulit, serviens apud eum septem annis aliis.

31 Videns autem Dominus quod despiceret Liam, aperuit vulvam ejus, sorore sterili permanente.
32 Quæ conceptum genuit filium, vocavitque nomen ejus Ruben, dicens: Vidit Dominus humilitatem meam: nunc amabit me vir meus.
33 Rursumque concepit et peperit filium, et ait: Quoniam audivit me Dominus haberi contemptui, dedit etiam istum mihi; vocavitque nomen ejus Simeon.
34 Concepitque tertio, et genuit alium filium: dixitque: Nunc quoque copulabitur mihi maritus meus: eo quod pepererim ei tres filios: et idcirco appellavit nomen ejus Levi.
35 Quarto concepit, et peperit filium, et ait: Modo confitebor Domino, et ob hoc vocavit eum Judam: cessavitque parere.


# Γένεσις 29 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐξάρας Ιακωβ τοὺς πόδας ἐπορεύθη εἰς γῆν ἀνατολῶν πρὸς Λαβαν τὸν υἱὸν Βαθουηλ τοῦ Σύρου ἀδελφὸν δὲ Ρεβεκκας μητρὸς Ιακωβ καὶ Ησαυ
2 καὶ ὁρᾷ καὶ ἰδοὺ φρέαρ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἦσαν δὲ ἐκεῖ τρία ποίμνια προβάτων ἀναπαυόμενα ἐ{P'} αὐτοῦ ἐκ γὰρ τοῦ φρέατος ἐκείνου ἐπότιζον τὰ ποίμνια λίθος δὲ ἦν μέγας ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι τοῦ φρέατος
3 καὶ συνήγοντο ἐκεῖ πάντα τὰ ποίμνια καὶ ἀπεκύλιον τὸν λίθον ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ φρέατος καὶ ἐπότιζον τὰ πρόβατα καὶ ἀπεκαθίστων τὸν λίθον ἐπὶ τὸ στόμα τοῦ φρέατος εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ
4 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ιακωβ ἀδελφοί πόθεν ἐστὲ ὑμεῖς οἱ δὲ εἶπαν ἐκ Χαρραν ἐσμέν
5 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς γινώσκετε Λαβαν τὸν υἱὸν Ναχωρ οἱ δὲ εἶπαν γινώσκομεν
6 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς ὑγιαίνει οἱ δὲ εἶπαν ὑγιαίνει καὶ ἰδοὺ Ραχηλ ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτοῦ ἤρχετο μετὰ τῶν προβάτων
7 καὶ εἶπεν Ιακωβ ἔτι ἐστὶν ἡμέρα πολλή οὔπω ὥρα συναχθῆναι τὰ κτήνη ποτίσαντες τὰ πρόβατα ἀπελθόντες βόσκετε
8 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν οὐ δυνησόμεθα ἕως τοῦ συναχθῆναι πάντας τοὺς ποιμένας καὶ ἀποκυλίσωσιν τὸν λίθον ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ φρέατος καὶ ποτιοῦμεν τὰ πρόβατα
9 ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος αὐτοῖς καὶ Ραχηλ ἡ θυγάτηρ Λαβαν ἤρχετο μετὰ τῶν προβάτων τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς αὐτὴ γὰρ ἔβοσκεν τὰ πρόβατα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς
10 ἐγένετο δὲ ὡς εἶδεν Ιακωβ τὴν Ραχηλ θυγατέρα Λαβαν ἀδελφοῦ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ πρόβατα Λαβαν ἀδελφοῦ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ προσελθὼν Ιακωβ ἀπεκύλισεν τὸν λίθον ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ φρέατος καὶ ἐπότισεν τὰ πρόβατα Λαβαν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ
11 καὶ ἐφίλησεν Ιακωβ τὴν Ραχηλ καὶ βοήσας τῇ φωνῇ αὐτοῦ ἔκλαυσεν
12 καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν τῇ Ραχηλ ὅτι ἀδελφὸς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς ἐστιν καὶ ὅτι υἱὸς Ρεβεκκας ἐστίν καὶ δραμοῦσα ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτῆς κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα

13 ἐγένετο δὲ ὡς ἤκουσεν Λαβαν τὸ ὄνομα Ιακωβ τοῦ υἱοῦ τῆς ἀδελφῆς αὐτοῦ ἔδραμεν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ καὶ περιλαβὼν αὐτὸν ἐφίλησεν καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ διηγήσατο τῷ Λαβαν πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους
14 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Λαβαν ἐκ τῶν ὀστῶν μου καὶ ἐκ τῆς σαρκός μου εἶ σύ καὶ ἦν με{T'} αὐτοῦ μῆνα ἡμερῶν
15 εἶπεν δὲ Λαβαν τῷ Ιακωβ ὅτι γὰρ ἀδελφός μου εἶ οὐ δουλεύσεις μοι δωρεάν ἀπάγγειλόν μοι τίς ὁ μισθός σού ἐστιν
16 τῷ δὲ Λαβαν δύο θυγατέρες ὄνομα τῇ μείζονι Λεια καὶ ὄνομα τῇ νεωτέρᾳ Ραχηλ
17 οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ Λειας ἀσθενεῖς Ραχηλ δὲ καλὴ τῷ εἴδει καὶ ὡραία τῇ ὄψει
18 ἠγάπησεν δὲ Ιακωβ τὴν Ραχηλ καὶ εἶπεν δουλεύσω σοι ἑπτὰ ἔτη περὶ Ραχηλ τῆς θυγατρός σου τῆς νεωτέρας
19 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Λαβαν βέλτιον δοῦναί με αὐτὴν σοὶ ἢ δοῦναί με αὐτὴν ἀνδρὶ ἑτέρῳ οἴκησον με{T'} ἐμοῦ
20 καὶ ἐδούλευσεν Ιακωβ περὶ Ραχηλ ἔτη ἑπτά καὶ ἦσαν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ὡς ἡμέραι ὀλίγαι παρὰ τὸ ἀγαπᾶν αὐτὸν αὐτήν

21 εἶπεν δὲ Ιακωβ πρὸς Λαβαν ἀπόδος τὴν γυναῖκά μου πεπλήρωνται γὰρ αἱ ἡμέραι μου ὅπως εἰσέλθω πρὸς αὐτήν
22 συνήγαγεν δὲ Λαβαν πάντας τοὺς ἄνδρας τοῦ τόπου καὶ ἐποίησεν γάμον
23 καὶ ἐγένετο ἑσπέρα καὶ λαβὼν Λαβαν Λειαν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὴν πρὸς Ιακωβ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτὴν Ιακωβ
24 ἔδωκεν δὲ Λαβαν Λεια τῇ θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ Ζελφαν τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ αὐτῇ παιδίσκην
25 ἐγένετο δὲ πρωί καὶ ἰδοὺ ἦν Λεια εἶπεν δὲ Ιακωβ τῷ Λαβαν τί τοῦτο ἐποίησάς μοι οὐ περὶ Ραχηλ ἐδούλευσα παρὰ σοί καὶ ἵνα τί παρελογίσω με
26 εἶπεν δὲ Λαβαν οὐκ ἔστιν οὕτως ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ἡμῶν δοῦναι τὴν νεωτέραν πρὶν ἢ τὴν πρεσβυτέραν
27 συντέλεσον οὖν τὰ ἕβδομα ταύτης καὶ δώσω σοι καὶ ταύτην ἀντὶ τῆς ἐργασίας ἧς ἐργᾷ πα{R'} ἐμοὶ ἔτι ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἕτερα
28 ἐποίησεν δὲ Ιακωβ οὕτως καὶ ἀνεπλήρωσεν τὰ ἕβδομα ταύτης καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ Λαβαν Ραχηλ τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ αὐτῷ γυναῖκα
29 ἔδωκεν δὲ Λαβαν Ραχηλ τῇ θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ Βαλλαν τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ αὐτῇ παιδίσκην
30 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς Ραχηλ ἠγάπησεν δὲ Ραχηλ μᾶλλον ἢ Λειαν καὶ ἐδούλευσεν αὐτῷ ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἕτερα

31 ἰδὼν δὲ κύριος ὅτι μισεῖται Λεια ἤνοιξεν τὴν μήτραν αὐτῆς Ραχηλ δὲ ἦν στεῖρα
32 καὶ συνέλαβεν Λεια καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν τῷ Ιακωβ ἐκάλεσεν δὲ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ρουβην λέγουσα διότι εἶδέν μου κύριος τὴν ταπείνωσιν νῦν με ἀγαπήσει ὁ ἀνήρ μου
33 καὶ συνέλαβεν πάλιν Λεια καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν δεύτερον τῷ Ιακωβ καὶ εἶπεν ὅτι ἤκουσεν κύριος ὅτι μισοῦμαι καὶ προσέδωκέν μοι καὶ τοῦτον ἐκάλεσεν δὲ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Συμεων
34 καὶ συνέλαβεν ἔτι καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν καὶ εἶπεν ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ πρὸς ἐμοῦ ἔσται ὁ ἀνήρ μου ἔτεκον γὰρ αὐτῷ τρεῖς υἱούς διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Λευι
35 καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτι ἔτεκεν υἱὸν καὶ εἶπεν νῦν ἔτι τοῦτο ἐξομολογήσομαι κυρίῳ διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ιουδα καὶ ἔστη τοῦ τίκτειν
