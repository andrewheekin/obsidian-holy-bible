# Book of Genesis 11 (RSVCE)

### The Tower of Babel
1 Now the whole earth had one language and few words.
2 And as men migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
3 And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
4 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.”
5 And theLordcame down to see the city and the tower, which the sons of men had built.
6 And theLordsaid, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; and nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
7 Come, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”
8 So theLordscattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
9 Therefore its name was called Babel, because there theLordconfused the language of all the earth; and from there theLordscattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.
### Descendants of Shem
10 These are the descendants of Shem. When Shem was a hundred years old, he became the father of Arpachʹshad two years after the flood;
11 and Shem lived after the birth of Arpachʹshad five hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
12 When Arpachʹshad had lived thirty-five years, he became the father of Shelah;
13 and Arpachʹshad lived after the birth of Shelah four hundred and three years, and had other sons and daughters.
14 When Shelah had lived thirty years, he became the father of Eber;
15 and Shelah lived after the birth of Eber four hundred and three years, and had other sons and daughters.
16 When Eber had lived thirty-four years, he became the father of Peleg;
17 and Eber lived after the birth of Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
18 When Peleg had lived thirty years, he became the father of Reʹu;
19 and Peleg lived after the birth of Reʹu two hundred and nine years, and had other sons and daughters.
20 When Reʹu had lived thirty-two years, he became the father of Serug;
21 and Reʹu lived after the birth of Serug two hundred and seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
22 When Serug had lived thirty years, he became the father of Nahor;
23 and Serug lived after the birth of Nahor two hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
24 When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he became the father of Terah;
25 and Nahor lived after the birth of Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
26 When Terah had lived seventy years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
### Descendants of Terah
27 Now these are the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.
28 Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chalʹdeans.
29 And Abram and Nahor took wives; the name of Abram’s wife was Sarʹai, and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah.
30 Now Sarʹai was barren; she had no child.
31 Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarʹai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeʹans to go into the land of Canaan; but when they came to Haran, they settled there.
32 The days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.


# Liber Genesis 11 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Erat autem terra labii unius, et sermonum eorumdem.
2 Cumque proficiscerentur de oriente, invenerunt campum in terra Senaar, et habitaverunt in eo.
3 Dixitque alter ad proximum suum: Venite, faciamus lateres, et coquamus eos igni. Habueruntque lateres pro saxis, et bitumen pro cæmento:
4 et dixerunt: Venite, faciamus nobis civitatem et turrim, cujus culmen pertingat ad cælum: et celebremus nomen nostrum antequam dividamur in universas terras.
5 Descendit autem Dominus ut videret civitatem et turrim, quam ædificabant filii Adam,
6 et dixit: Ecce, unus est populus, et unum labium omnibus: cœperuntque hoc facere, nec desistent a cogitationibus suis, donec eas opere compleant.
7 Venite igitur, descendamus, et confundamus ibi linguam eorum, ut non audiat unusquisque vocem proximi sui.
8 Atque ita divisit eos Dominus ex illo loco in universas terras, et cessaverunt ædificare civitatem.
9 Et idcirco vocatum est nomen ejus Babel, quia ibi confusum est labium universæ terræ: et inde dispersit eos Dominus super faciem cunctarum regionum.

10 Hæ sunt generationes Sem: Sem erat centum annorum quando genuit Arphaxad, biennio post diluvium.
11 Vixitque Sem, postquam genuit Arphaxad, quingentis annis: et genuit filios et filias.
12 Porro Arphaxad vixit triginta quinque annis, et genuit Sale.
13 Vixitque Arphaxad, postquam genuit Sale, trecentis tribus annis: et genuit filios et filias.
14 Sale quoque vixit triginta annis, et genuit Heber.
15 Vixitque Sale, postquam genuit Heber, quadringentis tribus annis: et genuit filios et filias.
16 Vixit autem Heber triginta quatuor annis, et genuit Phaleg.
17 Et vixit Heber postquam genuit Phaleg, quadringentis triginta annis: et genuit filios et filias.
18 Vixit quoque Phaleg triginta annis, et genuit Reu.
19 Vixitque Phaleg, postquam genuit Reu, ducentis novem annis: et genuit filios et filias.
20 Vixit autem Reu triginta duobus annis, et genuit Sarug.
21 Vixit quoque Reu, postquam genuit Sarug, ducentis septem annis: et genuit filios et filias.
22 Vixit vero Sarug triginta annis, et genuit Nachor.
23 Vixitque Sarug, postquam genuit Nachor, ducentis annis: et genuit filios et filias.
24 Vixit autem Nachor viginti novem annis, et genuit Thare.
25 Vixitque Nachor, postquam genuit Thare, centum decem et novem annis: et genuit filios et filias.
26 Vixitque Thare septuaginta annis, et genuit Abram, et Nachor, et Aran.

27 Hæ sunt autem generationes Thare: Thare genuit Abram, Nachor et Aran. Porro Aran genuit Lot.
28 Mortuusque est Aran ante Thare patrem suum, in terra nativitatis suæ, in Ur Chaldæorum.
29 Duxerunt autem Abram et Nachor uxores: nomen uxoris Abram, Sarai: et nomen uxoris Nachor, Melcha filia Aran, patris Melchæ, et patris Jeschæ.
30 Erat autem Sarai sterilis, nec habebat liberos.
31 Tulit itaque Thare Abram filium suum, et Lot filium Aran, filium filii sui, et Sarai nurum suam, uxorem Abram filii sui, et eduxit eos de Ur Chaldæorum, ut irent in terram Chanaan: veneruntque usque Haran, et habitaverunt ibi.
32 Et facti sunt dies Thare ducentorum quinque annorum, et mortuus est in Haran.

1 καὶ ἦν πᾶσα ἡ γῆ χεῖλος ἕν καὶ φωνὴ μία πᾶσιν
2 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ κινῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν εὗρον πεδίον ἐν γῇ Σεννααρ καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐκεῖ
3 καὶ εἶπεν ἄνθρωπος τῷ πλησίον δεῦτε πλινθεύσωμεν πλίνθους καὶ ὀπτήσωμεν αὐτὰς πυρί καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς ἡ πλίνθος εἰς λίθον καὶ ἄσφαλτος ἦν αὐτοῖς ὁ πηλός
4 καὶ εἶπαν δεῦτε οἰκοδομήσωμεν ἑαυτοῖς πόλιν καὶ πύργον οὗ ἡ κεφαλὴ ἔσται ἕως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ποιήσωμεν ἑαυτοῖς ὄνομα πρὸ τοῦ διασπαρῆναι ἐπὶ προσώπου πάσης τῆς γῆς
5 καὶ κατέβη κύριος ἰδεῖν τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὸν πύργον ὃν ᾠκοδόμησαν οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων
6 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος ἰδοὺ γένος ἓν καὶ χεῖλος ἓν πάντων καὶ τοῦτο ἤρξαντο ποιῆσαι καὶ νῦν οὐκ ἐκλείψει ἐξ αὐτῶν πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐπιθῶνται ποιεῖν
7 δεῦτε καὶ καταβάντες συγχέωμεν ἐκεῖ αὐτῶν τὴν γλῶσσαν ἵνα μὴ ἀκούσωσιν ἕκαστος τὴν φωνὴν τοῦ πλησίον
8 καὶ διέσπειρεν αὐτοὺς κύριος ἐκεῖθεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐπαύσαντο οἰκοδομοῦντες τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὸν πύργον
9 διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς Σύγχυσις ὅτι ἐκεῖ συνέχεεν κύριος τὰ χείλη πάσης τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐκεῖθεν διέσπειρεν αὐτοὺς κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς
