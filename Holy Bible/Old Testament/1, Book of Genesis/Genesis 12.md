# Book of Genesis 12 (RSVCE)

### The Call of Abram
1 Now theLordsaid to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you.
2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse; and by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves.”
4 So Abram went, as theLordhad told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
5 And Abram took Sarʹai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions which they had gathered, and the persons that they had gotten in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan,
6 Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
7 Then theLordappeared to Abram, and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to theLord, who had appeared to him.
8 Thence he removed to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to theLordand called on the name of theLord.
9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.
### Abram and Sarai in Egypt
10 Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarʹai his wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful to behold;
12 and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife’; then they will kill me, but they will let you live.
13 Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared on your account.”
14 When Abram entered Egypt the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
15 And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
16 And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, he-asses, menservants, maidservants, she-asses, and camels.
17 But theLordafflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarʹai, Abram’s wife.
18 So Pharaoh called Abram, and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her, and be gone.”
20 And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him; and they set him on the way, with his wife and all that he had.


# Liber Genesis 12 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dixit autem Dominus ad Abram: Egredere de terra tua, et de cognatione tua, et de domo patris tui, et veni in terram quam monstrabo tibi.
2 Faciamque te in gentem magnam, et benedicam tibi, et magnificabo nomen tuum, erisque benedictus.
3 Benedicam benedicentibus tibi, et maledicam maledicentibus tibi, atque in te benedicentur universæ cognationes terræ.
4 Egressus est itaque Abram sicut præceperat ei Dominus, et ivit cum eo Lot: septuaginta quinque annorum erat Abram cum egrederetur de Haran.
5 Tulitque Sarai uxorem suam, et Lot filium fratris sui, universamque substantiam quam possederant, et animas quas fecerant in Haran: et egressi sunt ut irent in terram Chanaan. Cumque venissent in eam,
6 pertransivit Abram terram usque ad locum Sichem, usque ad convallem illustrem: Chananæus autem tunc erat in terra.
7 Apparuit autem Dominus Abram, et dixit ei: Semini tuo dabo terram hanc. Qui ædificavit ibi altare Domino, qui apparuerat ei.
8 Et inde transgrediens ad montem, qui erat contra orientem Bethel, tetendit ibi tabernaculum suum, ab occidente habens Bethel, et ab oriente Hai: ædificavit quoque ibi altare Domino, et invocavit nomen ejus.

9 Perrexitque Abram vadens, et ultra progrediens ad meridiem.
10 Facta est autem fames in terra: descenditque Abram in Ægyptum, ut peregrinaretur ibi: prævaluerat enim fames in terra.
11 Cumque prope esset ut ingrederetur Ægyptum, dixit Sarai uxori suæ: Novi quod pulchra sis mulier:
12 et quod cum viderint te Ægyptii, dicturi sunt: Uxor ipsius est: et interficient me, et te reservabunt.
13 Dic ergo, obsecro te, quod soror mea sis: ut bene sit mihi propter te, et vivat anima mea ob gratiam tui.
14 Cum itaque ingressus esset Abram Ægyptum, viderunt Ægyptii mulierem quod esset pulchra nimis.
15 Et nuntiaverunt principes Pharaoni, et laudaverunt eam apud illum: et sublata est mulier in domum Pharaonis.
16 Abram vero bene usi sunt propter illam: fueruntque ei oves et boves et asini, et servi et famulæ, et asinæ et cameli.
17 Flagellavit autem Dominus Pharaonem plagis maximis, et domum ejus, propter Sarai uxorem Abram.
18 Vocavitque Pharao Abram, et dixit ei: Quidnam est hoc quod fecisti mihi? quare non indicasti quod uxor tua esset?
19 quam ob causam dixisti esse sororem tuam, ut tollerem eam mihi in uxorem? Nunc igitur ecce conjux tua, accipe eam, et vade.
20 Præcepitque Pharao super Abram viris: et deduxerunt eum, et uxorem illius, et omnia quæ habebat.


# Γένεσις 12 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος τῷ Αβραμ ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς γῆς σου καὶ ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας σου καὶ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός σου εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ἄν σοι δείξω
2 καὶ ποιήσω σε εἰς ἔθνος μέγα καὶ εὐλογήσω σε καὶ μεγαλυνῶ τὸ ὄνομά σου καὶ ἔσῃ εὐλογητός
3 καὶ εὐλογήσω τοὺς εὐλογοῦντάς σε καὶ τοὺς καταρωμένους σε καταράσομαι καὶ ἐνευλογηθήσονται ἐν σοὶ πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς
4 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Αβραμ καθάπερ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ κύριος καὶ ᾤχετο με{T'} αὐτοῦ Λωτ Αβραμ δὲ ἦν ἐτῶν ἑβδομήκοντα πέντε ὅτε ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ Χαρραν
5 καὶ ἔλαβεν Αβραμ τὴν Σαραν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν Λωτ υἱὸν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῶν ὅσα ἐκτήσαντο καὶ πᾶσαν ψυχήν ἣν ἐκτήσαντο ἐν Χαρραν καὶ ἐξήλθοσαν πορευθῆναι εἰς γῆν Χανααν καὶ ἦλθον εἰς γῆν Χανααν
6 καὶ διώδευσεν Αβραμ τὴν γῆν εἰς τὸ μῆκος αὐτῆς ἕως τοῦ τόπου Συχεμ ἐπὶ τὴν δρῦν τὴν ὑψηλήν οἱ δὲ Χαναναῖοι τότε κατῴκουν τὴν γῆν
7 καὶ ὤφθη κύριος τῷ Αβραμ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τῷ σπέρματί σου δώσω τὴν γῆν ταύτην καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ Αβραμ θυσιαστήριον κυρίῳ τῷ ὀφθέντι αὐτῷ
8 καὶ ἀπέστη ἐκεῖθεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος κα{T'} ἀνατολὰς Βαιθηλ καὶ ἔστησεν ἐκεῖ τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ Βαιθηλ κατὰ θάλασσαν καὶ Αγγαι κα{T'} ἀνατολάς καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι κυρίου

9 καὶ ἀπῆρεν Αβραμ καὶ πορευθεὶς ἐστρατοπέδευσεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ
10 καὶ ἐγένετο λιμὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ κατέβη Αβραμ εἰς Αἴγυπτον παροικῆσαι ἐκεῖ ὅτι ἐνίσχυσεν ὁ λιμὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
11 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἤγγισεν Αβραμ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς Αἴγυπτον εἶπεν Αβραμ Σαρα τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ γινώσκω ἐγὼ ὅτι γυνὴ εὐπρόσωπος εἶ
12 ἔσται οὖν ὡς ἂν ἴδωσίν σε οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ἐροῦσιν ὅτι γυνὴ αὐτοῦ αὕτη καὶ ἀποκτενοῦσίν με σὲ δὲ περιποιήσονται
13 εἰπὸν οὖν ὅτι ἀδελφὴ αὐτοῦ εἰμι ὅπως ἂν εὖ μοι γένηται διὰ σέ καὶ ζήσεται ἡ ψυχή μου ἕνεκεν σοῦ
14 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα εἰσῆλθεν Αβραμ εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἰδόντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τὴν γυναῖκα ὅτι καλὴ ἦν σφόδρα
15 καὶ εἶδον αὐτὴν οἱ ἄρχοντες Φαραω καὶ ἐπῄνεσαν αὐτὴν πρὸς Φαραω καὶ εἰσήγαγον αὐτὴν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φαραω
16 καὶ τῷ Αβραμ εὖ ἐχρήσαντο δ{I'} αὐτήν καὶ ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ πρόβατα καὶ μόσχοι καὶ ὄνοι παῖδες καὶ παιδίσκαι ἡμίονοι καὶ κάμηλοι
17 καὶ ἤτασεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν Φαραω ἐτασμοῖς μεγάλοις καὶ πονηροῖς καὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ περὶ Σαρας τῆς γυναικὸς Αβραμ
18 καλέσας δὲ Φαραω τὸν Αβραμ εἶπεν τί τοῦτο ἐποίησάς μοι ὅτι οὐκ ἀπήγγειλάς μοι ὅτι γυνή σού ἐστιν
19 ἵνα τί εἶπας ὅτι ἀδελφή μού ἐστιν καὶ ἔλαβον αὐτὴν ἐμαυτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἡ γυνή σου ἐναντίον σου λαβὼν ἀπότρεχε
20 καὶ ἐνετείλατο Φαραω ἀνδράσιν περὶ Αβραμ συμπροπέμψαι αὐτὸν καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτῷ καὶ Λωτ με{T'} αὐτοῦ
