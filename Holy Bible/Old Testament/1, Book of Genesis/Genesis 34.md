# Book of Genesis 34 (RSVCE)

### The Rape of Dinah
1 Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land;
2 and when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humbled her.
3 And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob; he loved the maiden and spoke tenderly to her.
4 So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this maiden for my wife.”
5 Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah; but his sons were with his cattle in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came.
6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
7 The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard of it; and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had wrought folly in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done.
8 But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; I pray you, give her to him in marriage.
9 Make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
10 You shall dwell with us; and the land shall be open to you; dwell and trade in it, and get property in it.”
11 Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.
12 Ask of me ever so much as marriage present and gift, and I will give according as you say to me; only give me the maiden to be my wife.”
13 The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.
14 They said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.
15 Only on this condition will we consent to you: that you will become as we are and every male of you be circumcised.
16 Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people.
17 But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.”
18 Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor’s son Shechem.
19 And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his family.
20 So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
21 “These men are friendly with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters in marriage, and let us give them our daughters.
22 Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.
23 Will not their cattle, their property and all their beasts be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us.”
24 And all who went out of the gate of his city hearkened to Hamor and his son Shechem; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
### Dinah’s Brothers Avenge Their Sister
25 On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and came upon the city unawares, and killed all the males.
26 They slew Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.
27 And the sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled;
28 they took their flocks and their herds, their asses, and whatever was in the city and in the field;
29 all their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and made their prey.
30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me odious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perʹizzites; my numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.”
31 But they said, “Should he treat our sister as a harlot?”


# Liber Genesis 34 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Egressa est autem Dina filia Liæ ut videret mulieres regionis illius.
2 Quam cum vidisset Sichem filius Hemor Hevæi, princeps terræ illius, adamavit eam: et rapuit, et dormivit cum illa, vi opprimens virginem.
3 Et conglutinata est anima ejus cum ea, tristemque delinivit blanditiis.
4 Et pergens ad Hemor patrem suum: Accipe, inquit, mihi puellam hanc conjugem.
5 Quod cum audisset Jacob absentibus filiis, et in pastu pecorum occupatis, siluit donec redirent.
6 Egresso autem Hemor patre Sichem ut loqueretur ad Jacob,
7 ecce filii ejus veniebant de agro: auditoque quod acciderat, irati sunt valde, eo quod fœdam rem operatus esset in Israël et, violata filia Jacob, rem illicitam perpetrasset.

8 Locutus est itaque Hemor ad eos: Sichem filii mei adhæsit anima filiæ vestræ: date eam illi uxorem:
9 et jungamus vicissim connubia: filias vestras tradite nobis, et filias nostras accipite,
10 et habitate nobiscum: terra in potestate vestra est: exercete, negotiamini, et possidete eam.
11 Sed et Sichem ad patrem et ad fratres ejus ait: Inveniam gratiam coram vobis: et quæcumque statueritis, dabo:
12 augete dotem, et munera postulate, et libenter tribuam quod petieritis: tantum date mihi puellam hanc uxorem.
13 Responderunt filii Jacob Sichem et patri ejus in dolo, sævientes ob stuprum sororis:
14 Non possumus facere quod petitis, nec dare sororem nostram homini incircumciso: quod illicitum et nefarium est apud nos.
15 Sed in hoc valebimus fœderari, si volueritis esse similes nostri, et circumcidatur in vobis omne masculini sexus;
16 tunc dabimus et accipiemus mutuo filias vestras ac nostras: et habitabimus vobiscum, erimusque unus populus.
17 Si autem circumcidi nolueritis, tollemus filiam nostram, et recedemus.
18 Placuit oblatio eorum Hemor, et Sichem filio ejus,
19 nec distulit adolescens quin statim quod petebatur expleret: amabat enim puellam valde, et ipse erat inclytus in omni domo patris sui.
20 Ingressique portam urbis, locuti sunt ad populum:
21 Viri isti pacifici sunt, et volunt habitare nobiscum: negotientur in terra, et exerceant eam, quæ spatiosa et lata cultoribus indiget: filias eorum accipiemus uxores, et nostras illis dabimus.
22 Unum est quo differtur tantum bonum: si circumcidamus masculos nostros, ritum gentis imitantes.
23 Et substantia eorum, et pecora, et cuncta quæ possident, nostra erunt: tantum in hoc acquiescamus, et habitantes simul, unum efficiemus populum.
24 Assensique sunt omnes, circumcisis cunctis maribus.

25 Et ecce, die tertio, quando gravissimus vulnerum dolor est: arreptis duo filii Jacob, Simeon et Levi fratres Dinæ, gladiis, ingressi sunt urbem confidenter: interfectisque omnibus masculis,
26 Hemor et Sichem pariter necaverunt, tollentes Dinam de domo Sichem sororem suam.
27 Quibus egressis, irruerunt super occisos ceteri filii Jacob: et depopulati sunt urbem in ultionem stupri.
28 Oves eorum, et armenta, et asinos, cunctaque vastantes quæ in domibus et in agris erant,
29 parvulos quoque eorum et uxores duxerunt captivas.
30 Quibus patratis audacter, Jacob dixit ad Simeon et Levi: Turbastis me, et odiosum fecistis me Chananæis, et Pherezæis habitatoribus terræ hujus: nos pauci sumus; illi congregati percutient me, et delebor ego, et domus mea.
31 Responderunt: Numquid ut scorto abuti debuere sorore nostra?

1 ἐξῆλθεν δὲ Δινα ἡ θυγάτηρ Λειας ἣν ἔτεκεν τῷ Ιακωβ καταμαθεῖν τὰς θυγατέρας τῶν ἐγχωρίων
2 καὶ εἶδεν αὐτὴν Συχεμ ὁ υἱὸς Εμμωρ ὁ Χορραῖος ὁ ἄρχων τῆς γῆς καὶ λαβὼν αὐτὴν ἐκοιμήθη με{T'} αὐτῆς καὶ ἐταπείνωσεν αὐτήν
3 καὶ προσέσχεν τῇ ψυχῇ Δινας τῆς θυγατρὸς Ιακωβ καὶ ἠγάπησεν τὴν παρθένον καὶ ἐλάλησεν κατὰ τὴν διάνοιαν τῆς παρθένου αὐτῇ
4 εἶπεν δὲ Συχεμ πρὸς Εμμωρ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ λέγων λαβέ μοι τὴν παιδίσκην ταύτην εἰς γυναῖκα
5 Ιακωβ δὲ ἤκουσεν ὅτι ἐμίανεν ὁ υἱὸς Εμμωρ Διναν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἦσαν μετὰ τῶν κτηνῶν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ παρεσιώπησεν δὲ Ιακωβ ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν αὐτούς
6 ἐξῆλθεν δὲ Εμμωρ ὁ πατὴρ Συχεμ πρὸς Ιακωβ λαλῆσαι αὐτῷ
7 οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ιακωβ ἦλθον ἐκ τοῦ πεδίου ὡς δὲ ἤκουσαν κατενύχθησαν οἱ ἄνδρες καὶ λυπηρὸν ἦν αὐτοῖς σφόδρα ὅτι ἄσχημον ἐποίησεν ἐν Ισραηλ κοιμηθεὶς μετὰ τῆς θυγατρὸς Ιακωβ καὶ οὐχ οὕτως ἔσται

8 καὶ ἐλάλησεν Εμμωρ αὐτοῖς λέγων Συχεμ ὁ υἱός μου προείλατο τῇ ψυχῇ τὴν θυγατέρα ὑμῶν δότε οὖν αὐτὴν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα
9 ἐπιγαμβρεύσασθε ἡμῖν τὰς θυγατέρας ὑμῶν δότε ἡμῖν καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ἡμῶν λάβετε τοῖς υἱοῖς ὑμῶν
10 καὶ ἐν ἡμῖν κατοικεῖτε καὶ ἡ γῆ ἰδοὺ πλατεῖα ἐναντίον ὑμῶν κατοικεῖτε καὶ ἐμπορεύεσθε ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς καὶ ἐγκτήσασθε ἐν αὐτῇ
11 εἶπεν δὲ Συχεμ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτῆς καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῆς εὕροιμι χάριν ἐναντίον ὑμῶν καὶ ὃ ἐὰν εἴπητε δώσομεν
12 πληθύνατε τὴν φερνὴν σφόδρα καὶ δώσω καθότι ἂν εἴπητέ μοι καὶ δώσετέ μοι τὴν παῖδα ταύτην εἰς γυναῖκα
13 ἀπεκρίθησαν δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Ιακωβ τῷ Συχεμ καὶ Εμμωρ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ μετὰ δόλου καὶ ἐλάλησαν αὐτοῖς ὅτι ἐμίαναν Διναν τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῶν
14 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς Συμεων καὶ Λευι οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Δινας υἱοὶ δὲ Λειας οὐ δυνησόμεθα ποιῆσαι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο δοῦναι τὴν ἀδελφὴν ἡμῶν ἀνθρώπῳ ὃς ἔχει ἀκροβυστίαν ἔστιν γὰρ ὄνειδος ἡμῖν
15 ἐν τούτῳ ὁμοιωθησόμεθα ὑμῖν καὶ κατοικήσομεν ἐν ὑμῖν ἐὰν γένησθε ὡς ἡμεῖς καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐν τῷ περιτμηθῆναι ὑμῶν πᾶν ἀρσενικόν
16 καὶ δώσομεν τὰς θυγατέρας ἡμῶν ὑμῖν καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων ὑμῶν λημψόμεθα ἡμῖν γυναῖκας καὶ οἰκήσομεν πα{R'} ὑμῖν καὶ ἐσόμεθα ὡς γένος ἕν
17 ἐὰν δὲ μὴ εἰσακούσητε ἡμῶν τοῦ περιτέμνεσθαι λαβόντες τὰς θυγατέρας ἡμῶν ἀπελευσόμεθα
18 καὶ ἤρεσαν οἱ λόγοι ἐναντίον Εμμωρ καὶ ἐναντίον Συχεμ τοῦ υἱοῦ Εμμωρ
19 καὶ οὐκ ἐχρόνισεν ὁ νεανίσκος τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ἐνέκειτο γὰρ τῇ θυγατρὶ Ιακωβ αὐτὸς δὲ ἦν ἐνδοξότατος πάντων τῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ
20 ἦλθεν δὲ Εμμωρ καὶ Συχεμ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν καὶ ἐλάλησαν πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν λέγοντες
21 οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὗτοι εἰρηνικοί εἰσιν με{Q'} ἡμῶν οἰκείτωσαν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐμπορευέσθωσαν αὐτήν ἡ δὲ γῆ ἰδοὺ πλατεῖα ἐναντίον αὐτῶν τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν λημψόμεθα ἡμῖν γυναῖκας καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ἡμῶν δώσομεν αὐτοῖς
22 μόνον ἐν τούτῳ ὁμοιωθήσονται ἡμῖν οἱ ἄνθρωποι τοῦ κατοικεῖν με{Q'} ἡμῶν ὥστε εἶναι λαὸν ἕνα ἐν τῷ περιτέμνεσθαι ἡμῶν πᾶν ἀρσενικόν καθὰ καὶ αὐτοὶ περιτέτμηνται
23 καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ τετράποδα οὐχ ἡμῶν ἔσται μόνον ἐν τούτῳ ὁμοιωθῶμεν αὐτοῖς καὶ οἰκήσουσιν με{Q'} ἡμῶν
24 καὶ εἰσήκουσαν Εμμωρ καὶ Συχεμ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ πάντες οἱ ἐκπορευόμενοι τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν καὶ περιετέμοντο τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτῶν πᾶς ἄρσην

25 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ ὅτε ἦσαν ἐν τῷ πόνῳ ἔλαβον οἱ δύο υἱοὶ Ιακωβ Συμεων καὶ Λευι οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Δινας ἕκαστος τὴν μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἀσφαλῶς καὶ ἀπέκτειναν πᾶν ἀρσενικόν
26 τόν τε Εμμωρ καὶ Συχεμ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπέκτειναν ἐν στόματι μαχαίρας καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν Διναν ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Συχεμ καὶ ἐξῆλθον
27 οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ιακωβ εἰσῆλθον ἐπὶ τοὺς τραυματίας καὶ διήρπασαν τὴν πόλιν ἐν ᾗ ἐμίαναν Διναν τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῶν
28 καὶ τὰ πρόβατα αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς βόας αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς ὄνους αὐτῶν ὅσα τε ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ ὅσα ἦν ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἔλαβον
29 καὶ πάντα τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀποσκευὴν αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν ᾐχμαλώτευσαν καὶ διήρπασαν ὅσα τε ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ ὅσα ἦν ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις
30 εἶπεν δὲ Ιακωβ Συμεων καὶ Λευι μισητόν με πεποιήκατε ὥστε πονηρόν με εἶναι πᾶσιν τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν τὴν γῆν ἔν τε τοῖς Χαναναίοις καὶ τοῖς Φερεζαίοις ἐγὼ δὲ ὀλιγοστός εἰμι ἐν ἀριθμῷ καὶ συναχθέντες ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ συγκόψουσίν με καὶ ἐκτριβήσομαι ἐγὼ καὶ ὁ οἶκός μου
31 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν ἀλ{L'} ὡσεὶ πόρνῃ χρήσωνται τῇ ἀδελφῇ ἡμῶν
