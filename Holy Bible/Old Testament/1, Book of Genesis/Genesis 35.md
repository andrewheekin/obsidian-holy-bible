# Book of Genesis 35 (RSVCE)

### Jacob Returns to Bethel
1 God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there; and make there an altar to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”
2 So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments;
3 then let us arise and go up to Bethel, that I may make there an altar to the God who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.”
4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem.
5 And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were round about them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
6 And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,
7 and there he built an altar, and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.
8 And Debʹorah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel; so the name of it was called Alʹlon-bacuth.
9 God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
10 And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.” So his name was called Israel.
11 And God said to him, “I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall spring from you.
12 The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your descendants after you.”
13 Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.
14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.
15 So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.
### The Birth of Benjamin and the Death of Rachel
16 Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
17 And when she was in her hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Fear not; for now you will have another son.”
18 And as her soul was departing (for she died), she called his name Ben-oʹni; but his father called his name Benjamin.
19 So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),
20 and Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel’s tomb, which is there to this day.
21 Israel journeyed on, and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
22 While Israel dwelt in that land Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
23 The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob’s first-born), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Isʹsachar, and Zebʹulun.
24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maid: Dan and Naphʹtali.
26 The sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maid: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
### The Death of Isaac
27 And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kirʹiath-arʹba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
28 Now the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.
29 And Isaac breathed his last; and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.


# Liber Genesis 35 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Interea locutus est Deus ad Jacob: Surge, et ascende Bethel, et habita ibi, facque altare Deo qui apparuit tibi quando fugiebas Esau fratrem tuum.
2 Jacob vero convocata omni domo sua, ait: Abjicite deos alienos qui in medio vestri sunt, et mundamini, ac mutate vestimenta vestra.
3 Surgite, et ascendamus in Bethel, ut faciamus ibi altare Deo: qui exaudivit me in die tribulationis meæ, et socius fuit itineris mei.
4 Dederunt ergo ei omnes deos alienos quos habebant, et inaures quæ erant in auribus eorum: at ille infodit ea subter terebinthum, quæ est post urbem Sichem.
5 Cumque profecti essent, terror Dei invasit omnes per circuitum civitates, et non sunt ausi persequi recedentes.

6 Venit igitur Jacob Luzam, quæ est in terra Chanaan, cognomento Bethel: ipse et omnis populus cum eo.
7 Ædificavitque ibi altare, et appellavit nomen loci illius, Domus Dei: ibi enim apparuit ei Deus cum fugeret fratrem suum.
8 Eodem tempore mortua est Debora nutrix Rebeccæ, et sepulta est ad radices Bethel subter quercum: vocatumque est nomen loci illius, Quercus fletus.
9 Apparuit autem iterum Deus Jacob postquam reversus est de Mesopotamia Syriæ, benedixitque ei
10 dicens: Non vocaberis ultra Jacob, sed Israël erit nomen tuum. Et appellavit eum Israël,
11 dixitque ei: Ego Deus omnipotens: cresce, et multiplicare: gentes et populi nationum ex te erunt, reges de lumbis tuis egredientur,
12 terramque quam dedi Abraham et Isaac, dabo tibi et semini tuo post te.
13 Et recessit ab eo.
14 Ille vero erexit titulum lapideum in loco quo locutus fuerat ei Deus: libans super eum libamina, et effundens oleum:
15 vocansque nomen loci illius Bethel.
16 Egressus autem inde, venit verno tempore ad terram quæ ducit Ephratam: in qua cum parturiret Rachel,
17 ob difficultatem partus periclitari cœpit. Dixitque ei obstetrix: Noli timere, quia et hunc habebis filium.
18 Egrediente autem anima præ dolore, et imminente jam morte, vocavit nomen filii sui Benomi, id est, Filius doloris mei: pater vero appellavit eum Benjamin, id est, Filius dextræ.
19 Mortua est ergo Rachel, et sepulta est in via quæ ducit Ephratam, hæc est Bethlehem.
20 Erexitque Jacob titulum super sepulchrum ejus: hic est titulus monumenti Rachel, usque in præsentem diem.
21 Egressus inde, fixit tabernaculum trans Turrem gregis.

22 Cumque habitaret in illa regione, abiit Ruben, et dormivit cum Bala concubina patris sui: quod illum minime latuit. Erant autem filii Jacob duodecim.
23 Filii Liæ: primogenitus Ruben, et Simeon, et Levi, et Judas, et Issachar, et Zabulon.
24 Filii Rachel: Joseph et Benjamin.
25 Filii Balæ ancillæ Rachelis: Dan et Nephthali.
26 Filii Zelphæ ancillæ Liæ: Gad et Aser: hi sunt filii Jacob, qui nati sunt ei in Mesopotamia Syriæ.

27 Venit etiam ad Isaac patrem suum in Mambre, civitatem Arbee, hæc est Hebron, in qua peregrinatus est Abraham et Isaac.
28 Et completi sunt dies Isaac centum octoginta annorum.
29 Consumptusque ætate mortuus est: et appositus est populo suo senex et plenus dierum: et sepelierunt eum Esau et Jacob filii sui.

1 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ θεὸς πρὸς Ιακωβ ἀναστὰς ἀνάβηθι εἰς τὸν τόπον Βαιθηλ καὶ οἴκει ἐκεῖ καὶ ποίησον ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον τῷ θεῷ τῷ ὀφθέντι σοι ἐν τῷ ἀποδιδράσκειν σε ἀπὸ προσώπου Ησαυ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου
2 εἶπεν δὲ Ιακωβ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἄρατε τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους τοὺς με{Q'} ὑμῶν ἐκ μέσου ὑμῶν καὶ καθαρίσασθε καὶ ἀλλάξατε τὰς στολὰς ὑμῶν
3 καὶ ἀναστάντες ἀναβῶμεν εἰς Βαιθηλ καὶ ποιήσωμεν ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον τῷ θεῷ τῷ ἐπακούσαντί μοι ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλίψεως ὃς ἦν με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ διέσωσέν με ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἐπορεύθην
4 καὶ ἔδωκαν τῷ Ιακωβ τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους οἳ ἦσαν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἐνώτια τὰ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν αὐτῶν καὶ κατέκρυψεν αὐτὰ Ιακωβ ὑπὸ τὴν τερέμινθον τὴν ἐν Σικιμοις καὶ ἀπώλεσεν αὐτὰ ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας
5 καὶ ἐξῆρεν Ισραηλ ἐκ Σικιμων καὶ ἐγένετο φόβος θεοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις τὰς κύκλῳ αὐτῶν καὶ οὐ κατεδίωξαν ὀπίσω τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ

12 καὶ τὴν γῆν ἣν δέδωκα Αβρααμ καὶ Ισαακ σοὶ δέδωκα αὐτήν σοὶ ἔσται καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου μετὰ σὲ δώσω τὴν γῆν ταύτην
13 ἀνέβη δὲ ὁ θεὸς ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ ἐκ τοῦ τόπου οὗ ἐλάλησεν με{T'} αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ ἔστησεν Ιακωβ στήλην ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ᾧ ἐλάλησεν με{T'} αὐτοῦ στήλην λιθίνην καὶ ἔσπεισεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὴν σπονδὴν καὶ ἐπέχεεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὴν ἔλαιον
15 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ιακωβ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐν ᾧ ἐλάλησεν με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ ὁ θεός Βαιθηλ
16 ἀπάρας δὲ Ιακωβ ἐκ Βαιθηλ ἔπηξεν τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ ἐπέκεινα τοῦ πύργου Γαδερ ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἤγγισεν Χαβραθα εἰς γῆν ἐλθεῖν Εφραθα ἔτεκεν Ραχηλ καὶ ἐδυστόκησεν ἐν τῷ τοκετῷ
17 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ σκληρῶς αὐτὴν τίκτειν εἶπεν αὐτῇ ἡ μαῖα θάρσει καὶ γὰρ οὗτός σοί ἐστιν υἱός
18 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ ἀφιέναι αὐτὴν τὴν ψυχήν ἀπέθνῃσκεν γάρ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Υἱὸς ὀδύνης μου ὁ δὲ πατὴρ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν Βενιαμιν
19 ἀπέθανεν δὲ Ραχηλ καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ Εφραθα αὕτη ἐστὶν Βηθλεεμ
20 καὶ ἔστησεν Ιακωβ στήλην ἐπὶ τοῦ μνημείου αὐτῆς αὕτη ἐστὶν στήλη μνημείου Ραχηλ ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας
21

22 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα κατῴκησεν Ισραηλ ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐκείνῃ ἐπορεύθη Ρουβην καὶ ἐκοιμήθη μετὰ Βαλλας τῆς παλλακῆς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἤκουσεν Ισραηλ καὶ πονηρὸν ἐφάνη ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ἦσαν δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Ιακωβ δώδεκα
