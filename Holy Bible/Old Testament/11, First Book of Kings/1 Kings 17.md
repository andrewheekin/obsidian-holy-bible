# First Book of Kings 17 (RSVCE)

### Elijah Predicts a Drought
1 Now Eliʹjah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As theLordthe God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word.”
2 And the word of theLordcame to him,
3 “Depart from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is east of the Jordan.
4 You shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.”
5 So he went and did according to the word of theLord; he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith that is east of the Jordan.
6 And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook.
7 And after a while the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
### The Widow of Zarephath
8 Then the word of theLordcame to him,
9 “Arise, go to Zarʹephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you.”
10 So he arose and went to Zarʹephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her and said, “Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.”
11 And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, “Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.”
12 And she said, “As theLordyour God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a cruse; and now, I am gathering a couple of sticks, that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.”
13 And Eliʹjah said to her, “Fear not; go and do as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make for yourself and your son.
14 For thus says theLordthe God of Israel, ‘The jar of meal shall not be spent, and the cruse of oil shall not fail, until the day that theLordsends rain upon the earth.’ ”
15 And she went and did as Eliʹjah said; and she, and he, and her household ate for many days.
16 The jar of meal was not spent, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of theLordwhich he spoke by Eliʹjah.
### Elijah Revives the Widow’s Son
17 After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill; and his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.
18 And she said to Eliʹjah, “What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!”
19 And he said to her, “Give me your son.” And he took him from her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber, where he lodged, and laid him upon his own bed.
20 And he cried to theLord, “OLordmy God, hast thou brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?”
21 Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to theLord, “OLordmy God, let this child’s soul come into him again.”
22 And theLordhearkened to the voice of Eliʹjah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
23 And Eliʹjah took the child, and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Eliʹjah said, “See, your son lives.”
24 And the woman said to Eliʹjah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of theLordin your mouth is truth.”


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 17 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et dixit Elias Thesbites de habitatoribus Galaad ad Achab: Vivit Dominus Deus Israël, in cujus conspectu sto, si erit annis his ros et pluvia, nisi juxta oris mei verba.
2 Et factum est verbum Domini ad eum, dicens:
3 Recede hinc, et vade contra orientem, et abscondere in torrente Carith, qui est contra Jordanem,
4 et ibi de torrente bibes: corvisque præcepi ut pascant te ibi.
5 Abiit ergo, et fecit juxta verbum Domini: cumque abiisset, sedit in torrente Carith, qui est contra Jordanem.
6 Corvi quoque deferebant ei panem et carnes mane, similiter panem et carnes vesperi, et bibebat de torrente.
7 Post dies autem siccatus est torrens: non enim pluerat super terram.

8 Factus est ergo sermo Domini ad eum, dicens:
9 Surge, et vade in Sarephta Sidoniorum, et manebis ibi: præcepi enim ibi mulieri viduæ ut pascat te.
10 Surrexit, et abiit in Sarephta. Cumque venisset ad portam civitatis, apparuit ei mulier vidua colligens ligna, et vocavit eam, dixitque ei: Da mihi paululum aquæ in vase ut bibam.
11 Cumque illa pergeret ut afferret, clamavit post tergum ejus, dicens: Affer mihi, obsecro, et buccellam panis in manu tua.
12 Quæ respondit: Vivit Dominus Deus tuus, quia non habeo panem, nisi quantum pugillus capere potest farinæ in hydria, et paululum olei in lecytho: en colligo duo ligna ut ingrediar et faciam illum mihi et filio meo, ut comedamus, et moriamur.
13 Ad quam Elias ait: Noli timere, sed vade, et fac sicut dixisti: verumtamen mihi primum fac de ipsa farinula subcinericium panem parvulum, et affer ad me: tibi autem et filio tuo facies postea.
14 Hæc autem dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Hydria farinæ non deficiet, nec lecythus olei minuetur, usque ad diem in qua Dominus daturus est pluviam super faciem terræ.
15 Quæ abiit, et fecit juxta verbum Eliæ: et comedit ipse, et illa, et domus ejus: et ex illa die
16 hydria farinæ non defecit, et lecythus olei non est imminutus, juxta verbum Domini quod locutus fuerat in manu Eliæ.

17 Factum est autem post hæc, ægrotavit filius mulieris matrisfamilias, et erat languor fortissimus, ita ut non remaneret in eo halitus.
18 Dixit ergo ad Eliam: Quid mihi et tibi, vir Dei? ingressus es ad me, ut rememorarentur iniquitates meæ, et interficeres filium meum?
19 Et ait ad eam Elias: Da mihi filium tuum. Tulitque eum de sinu ejus, et portavit in cœnaculum ubi ipse manebat, et posuit super lectulum suum.
20 Et clamavit ad Dominum, et dixit: Domine Deus meus, etiam ne viduam apud quam ego utcumque sustentor, afflixisti ut interficeres filium ejus?
21 Et expandit se, atque mensus est super puerum tribus vicibus, et clamavit ad Dominum, et ait: Domine Deus meus, revertatur, obsecro, anima pueri hujus in viscera ejus.
22 Et exaudivit Dominus vocem Eliæ: et reversa est anima pueri intra eum, et revixit.
23 Tulitque Elias puerum, et deposuit eum de cœnaculo in inferiorem domum, et tradidit matri suæ, et ait illi: En vivit filius tuus.
24 Dixitque mulier ad Eliam: Nunc in isto cognovi quoniam vir Dei es tu, et verbum Domini in ore tuo verum est.


# Βασιλειῶν Γʹ 17 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου ὁ προφήτης ὁ Θεσβίτης ἐκ Θεσβων τῆς Γαλααδ πρὸς Αχααβ ζῇ κύριος ὁ θεὸς τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ᾧ παρέστην ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ εἰ ἔσται τὰ ἔτη ταῦτα δρόσος καὶ ὑετὸς ὅτι εἰ μὴ διὰ στόματος λόγου μου
2 καὶ ἐγένετο ῥῆμα κυρίου πρὸς Ηλιου
3 πορεύου ἐντεῦθεν κατὰ ἀνατολὰς καὶ κρύβηθι ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ Χορραθ τοῦ ἐπὶ προσώπου τοῦ Ιορδάνου
4 καὶ ἔσται ἐκ τοῦ χειμάρρου πίεσαι ὕδωρ καὶ τοῖς κόραξιν ἐντελοῦμαι διατρέφειν σε ἐκεῖ
5 καὶ ἐποίησεν Ηλιου κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ Χορραθ ἐπὶ προσώπου τοῦ Ιορδάνου
6 καὶ οἱ κόρακες ἔφερον αὐτῷ ἄρτους τὸ πρωὶ καὶ κρέα τὸ δείλης καὶ ἐκ τοῦ χειμάρρου ἔπινεν ὕδωρ
7 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ἡμέρας καὶ ἐξηράνθη ὁ χειμάρρους ὅτι οὐκ ἐγένετο ὑετὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς

8 καὶ ἐγένετο ῥῆμα κυρίου πρὸς Ηλιου
9 ἀνάστηθι καὶ πορεύου εἰς Σαρεπτα τῆς Σιδωνίας ἰδοὺ ἐντέταλμαι ἐκεῖ γυναικὶ χήρᾳ τοῦ διατρέφειν σε
10 καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Σαρεπτα εἰς τὸν πυλῶνα τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκεῖ γυνὴ χήρα συνέλεγεν ξύλα καὶ ἐβόησεν ὀπίσω αὐτῆς Ηλιου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ λαβὲ δή μοι ὀλίγον ὕδωρ εἰς ἄγγος καὶ πίομαι
11 καὶ ἐπορεύθη λαβεῖν καὶ ἐβόησεν ὀπίσω αὐτῆς Ηλιου καὶ εἶπεν λήμψῃ δή μοι ψωμὸν ἄρτου ἐν τῇ χειρί σου
12 καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνή ζῇ κύριος ὁ θεός σου εἰ ἔστιν μοι ἐγκρυφίας ἀλ{L'} ἢ ὅσον δρὰξ ἀλεύρου ἐν τῇ ὑδρίᾳ καὶ ὀλίγον ἔλαιον ἐν τῷ καψάκῃ καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ συλλέγω δύο ξυλάρια καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι καὶ ποιήσω αὐτὸ ἐμαυτῇ καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις μου καὶ φαγόμεθα καὶ ἀποθανούμεθα
13 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὴν Ηλιου θάρσει εἴσελθε καὶ ποίησον κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου ἀλλὰ ποίησον ἐμοὶ ἐκεῖθεν ἐγκρυφίαν μικρὸν ἐν πρώτοις καὶ ἐξοίσεις μοι σαυτῇ δὲ καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις σου ποιήσεις ἐ{P'} ἐσχάτου
14 ὅτι τάδε λέγει κύριος ἡ ὑδρία τοῦ ἀλεύρου οὐκ ἐκλείψει καὶ ὁ καψάκης τοῦ ἐλαίου οὐκ ἐλαττονήσει ἕως ἡμέρας τοῦ δοῦναι κύριον τὸν ὑετὸν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
15 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἡ γυνὴ καὶ ἐποίησεν καὶ ἤσθιεν αὐτὴ καὶ αὐτὸς καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς
16 καὶ ἡ ὑδρία τοῦ ἀλεύρου οὐκ ἐξέλιπεν καὶ ὁ καψάκης τοῦ ἐλαίου οὐκ ἐλαττονώθη κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ Ηλιου

17 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἠρρώστησεν ὁ υἱὸς τῆς γυναικὸς τῆς κυρίας τοῦ οἴκου καὶ ἦν ἡ ἀρρωστία αὐτοῦ κραταιὰ σφόδρα ἕως οὗ οὐχ ὑπελείφθη ἐν αὐτῷ πνεῦμα
18 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς Ηλιου τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί ἄνθρωπε τοῦ θεοῦ εἰσῆλθες πρός με τοῦ ἀναμνῆσαι τὰς ἀδικίας μου καὶ θανατῶσαι τὸν υἱόν μου
19 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα δός μοι τὸν υἱόν σου καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ κόλπου αὐτῆς καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ ὑπερῷον ἐν ᾧ αὐτὸς ἐκάθητο ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐκοίμισεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης αὐτοῦ
20 καὶ ἀνεβόησεν Ηλιου καὶ εἶπεν οἴμμοι κύριε ὁ μάρτυς τῆς χήρας με{Q'} ἧς ἐγὼ κατοικῶ με{T'} αὐτῆς σὺ κεκάκωκας τοῦ θανατῶσαι τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς
21 καὶ ἐνεφύσησεν τῷ παιδαρίῳ τρὶς καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν κύριον καὶ εἶπεν κύριε ὁ θεός μου ἐπιστραφήτω δὴ ἡ ψυχὴ τοῦ παιδαρίου τούτου εἰς αὐτόν
22 καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως καὶ ἀνεβόησεν τὸ παιδάριον
23 καὶ κατήγαγεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὑπερῴου εἰς τὸν οἶκον καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου βλέπε ζῇ ὁ υἱός σου
24 καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς Ηλιου ἰδοὺ ἔγνωκα ὅτι ἄνθρωπος θεοῦ εἶ σὺ καὶ ῥῆμα κυρίου ἐν στόματί σου ἀληθινόν
