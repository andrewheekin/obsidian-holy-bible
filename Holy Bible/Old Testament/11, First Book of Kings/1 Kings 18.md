# First Book of Kings 18 (RSVCE)

### Elijah’s Message to Ahab
1 After many days the word of theLordcame to Eliʹjah, in the third year, saying, “Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.”
2 So Eliʹjah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samarʹia.
3 And Ahab called Obadiʹah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiʹah revered theLordgreatly;
4 and when Jezʹebel cut off the prophets of theLord, Obadiʹah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
5 And Ahab said to Obadiʹah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys; perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.”
6 So they divided the land between them to pass through it; Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiʹah went in another direction by himself.
7 And as Obadiʹah was on the way, behold, Eliʹjah met him; and Obadiʹah recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, “Is it you, my lord Eliʹjah?”
8 And he answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Eliʹjah is here.’ ”
9 And he said, “Wherein have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?
10 As theLordyour God lives, there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord has not sent to seek you; and when they would say, ‘He is not here,’ he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you.
11 And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Eliʹjah is here.” ’
12 And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of theLordwill carry you whither I know not; and so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have revered theLordfrom my youth.
13 Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezʹebel killed the prophets of theLord, how I hid a hundred men of theLord’s prophets by fifties in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
14 And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Eliʹjah is here” ’; and he will kill me.”
15 And Eliʹjah said, “As theLordof hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.”
16 So Obadiʹah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Eliʹjah.
17 When Ahab saw Eliʹjah, Ahab said to him, “Is it you, you troubler of Israel?”
18 And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel; but you have, and your father’s house, because you have forsaken the commandments of theLordand followed the Baʹals.
19 Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baʹal and the four hundred prophets of Asheʹrah, who eat at Jezʹebel’s table.”
### Elijah’s Triumph over the Priests of Baal
20 So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel, and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
21 And Eliʹjah came near to all the people, and said, “How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If theLordis God, follow him; but if Baʹal, then follow him.” And the people did not answer him a word.
22 Then Eliʹjah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of theLord; but Baʹal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
23 Let two bulls be given to us; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it; and I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood, and put no fire to it.
24 And you call on the name of your god and I will call on the name of theLord; and the God who answers by fire, he is God.” And all the people answered, “It is well spoken.”
25 Then Eliʹjah said to the prophets of Baʹal, “Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire to it.”
26 And they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baʹal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baʹal, answer us!” But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped about the altar which they had made.
27 And at noon Eliʹjah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.”
28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them.
29 And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice; no one answered, no one heeded.
30 Then Eliʹjah said to all the people, “Come near to me”; and all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of theLordthat had been thrown down;
31 Eliʹjah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of theLordcame, saying, “Israel shall be your name”;
32 and with the stones he built an altar in the name of theLord. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, “Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.”
34 And he said, “Do it a second time”; and they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time”; and they did it a third time.
35 And the water ran round about the altar, and filled the trench also with water.
36 And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Eliʹjah the prophet came near and said, “OLord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.
37 Answer me, OLord, answer me, that this people may know that thou, OLord, art God, and that thou hast turned their hearts back.”
38 Then the fire of theLordfell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, “TheLord, he is God; theLord, he is God.”
40 And Eliʹjah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baʹal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them; and Eliʹjah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.
### The Drought Ends
41 And Eliʹjah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of the rushing of rain.”
42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Eliʹjah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.
43 And he said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” And he went up and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” And he said, “Go again seven times.”
44 And at the seventh time he said, “Behold, a little cloud like a man’s hand is rising out of the sea.” And he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.’ ”
45 And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreʹel.
46 And the hand of theLordwas on Eliʹjah; and he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreʹel.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 18 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Post dies multos factum est verbum Domini ad Eliam, in anno tertio, dicens: Vade, et ostende te Achab, ut dem pluviam super faciem terræ.
2 Ivit ergo Elias, ut ostenderet se Achab: erat autem fames vehemens in Samaria.
3 Vocavitque Achab Abdiam dispensatorem domus suæ: Abdias autem timebat Dominum valde.
4 Nam cum interficeret Jezabel prophetas Domini, tulit ille centum prophetas, et abscondit eos quinquagenos et quinquagenos in speluncis, et pavit eos pane et aqua.
5 Dixit ergo Achab ad Abdiam: Vade in terram ad universos fontes aquarum, et in cunctas valles, si forte possimus invenire herbam, et salvare equos et mulos, et non penitus jumenta intereant.
6 Diviseruntque sibi regiones ut circuirent eas: Achab ibat per viam unam, et Abdias per viam alteram seorsum.
7 Cumque esset Abdias in via, Elias occurrit ei: qui cum cognovisset eum, cecidit super faciem suam, et ait: Num tu es, domine mi, Elias?
8 Cui ille respondit: Ego. Vade, et dic domino tuo: Adest Elias.

9 Et ille: Quid peccavi, inquit, quoniam tradis me servum tuum in manu Achab, ut interficiat me?
10 Vivit Dominus Deus tuus, quia non est gens aut regnum quo non miserit dominus meus te requirens: et respondentibus cunctis: Non est hic: adjuravit regna singula et gentes, eo quod minime reperireris.
11 Et nunc tu dicis mihi: Vade, et dic domino tuo: Adest Elias.
12 Cumque recessero a te, spiritus Domini asportabit te in locum quem ego ignoro: et ingressus nuntiabo Achab, et non inveniens te, interficiet me: servus autem tuus timet Dominum ab infantia sua.
13 Numquid non indicatum est tibi domino meo quid fecerim cum interficeret Jezabel prophetas Domini, quod absconderim de prophetis Domini centum viros, quinquagenos et quinquagenos, in speluncis, et paverim eos pane et aqua?
14 et nunc tu dicis: Vade, et dic domino tuo: Adest Elias: ut interficiat me?
15 Et dixit Elias: Vivit Dominus exercituum, ante cujus vultum sto, quia hodie apparebo ei.

16 Abiit ergo Abdias in occursum Achab, et indicavit ei: venitque Achab in occursum Eliæ.
17 Et cum vidisset eum, ait: Tune es ille, qui conturbas Israël?
18 Et ille ait: Non ego turbavi Israël, sed tu, et domus patris tui, qui dereliquistis mandata Domini, et secuti estis Baalim.
19 Verumtamen nunc mitte, et congrega ad me universum Israël in monte Carmeli, et prophetas Baal quadringentos quinquaginta, prophetasque lucorum quadringentos, qui comedunt de mensa Jezabel.
20 Misit Achab ad omnes filios Israël, et congregavit prophetas in monte Carmeli.

21 Accedens autem Elias ad omnem populum, ait: Usquequo claudicatis in duas partes? si Dominus est Deus, sequimini eum: si autem Baal, sequimini illum. Et non respondit ei populus verbum.
22 Et ait rursus Elias ad populum: Ego remansi propheta Domini solus: prophetæ autem Baal quadringenti et quinquaginta viri sunt.
23 Dentur nobis duo boves, et illi eligant sibi bovem unum, et in frusta cædentes ponant super ligna, ignem autem non supponant: et ego faciam bovem alterum, et imponam super ligna, ignem autem non supponam.
24 Invocate nomina deorum vestrorum, et ego invocabo nomen Domini mei: et Deus qui exaudierit per ignem, ipse sit Deus. Respondens omnis populus ait: Optima propositio.

25 Dixit ergo Elias prophetis Baal: Eligite vobis bovem unum, et facite primi, quia vos plures estis: et invocate nomina deorum vestrorum, ignemque non supponatis.
26 Qui cum tulissent bovem quem dederat eis, fecerunt: et invocabant nomen Baal de mane usque ad meridiem, dicentes: Baal, exaudi nos. Et non erat vox, nec qui responderet: transiliebantque altare quod fecerant.
27 Cumque esset jam meridies, illudebat illis Elias, dicens: Clamate voce majore: deus enim est, et forsitan loquitur, aut in diversorio est, aut in itinere, aut certe dormit, ut excitetur.
28 Clamabant ergo voce magna, et incidebant se juxta ritum suum cultris et lanceolis, donec perfunderentur sanguine.
29 Postquam autem transiit meridies, et illis prophetantibus venerat tempus quo sacrificium offerri solet, nec audiebatur vox, nec aliquis respondebat, nec attendebat orantes,

30 dixit Elias omni populo: Venite ad me.Et accedente ad se populo, curavit altare Domini quod destructum fuerat.
31 Et tulit duodecim lapides juxta numerum tribuum filiorum Jacob, ad quem factus est sermo Domini, dicens: Israël erit nomen tuum.
32 Et ædificavit de lapidibus altare in nomine Domini: fecitque aquæductum, quasi per duas aratiunculas in circuitu altaris,
33 et composuit ligna: divisitque per membra bovem, et posuit super ligna,
34 et ait: Implete quatuor hydrias aqua, et fundite super holocaustum et super ligna. Rursumque dixit: Etiam secundo hoc facite. Qui cum fecissent secundo, ait: Etiam tertio idipsum facite. Feceruntque tertio,
35 et currebant aquæ circum altare, et fossa aquæductus repleta est.

36 Cumque jam tempus esset ut offerretur holocaustum, accedens Elias propheta ait: Domine Deus Abraham, et Isaac, et Israël, ostende hodie quia tu es Deus Israël, et ego servus tuus, et juxta præceptum tuum feci omnia verba hæc.
37 Exaudi me, Domine, exaudi me: ut discat populus iste quia tu es Dominus Deus, et tu convertisti cor eorum iterum.
38 Cecidit autem ignis Domini, et voravit holocaustum, et ligna, et lapides, pulverem quoque, et aquam quæ erat in aquæductu lambens.
39 Quod cum vidisset omnis populus, cecidit in faciem suam, et ait: Dominus ipse est Deus, Dominus ipse est Deus.
40 Dixitque Elias ad eos: Apprehendite prophetas Baal, et ne unus quidem effugiat ex eis. Quos cum apprehendissent, duxit eos Elias ad torrentem Cison, et interfecit eos ibi.

41 Et ait Elias ad Achab: Ascende, comede, et bibe, quia sonus multæ pluviæ est.
42 Ascendit Achab ut comederet et biberet: Elias autem ascendit in verticem Carmeli, et pronus in terram posuit faciem suam inter genua sua,
43 et dixit ad puerum suum: Ascende, et prospice contra mare. Qui cum ascendisset, et contemplatus esset, ait: Non est quidquam. Et rursum ait illi: Revertere septem vicibus.
44 In septima autem vice, ecce nubecula parva quasi vestigium hominis ascendebat de mari. Qui ait: Ascende, et dic Achab: Junge currum tuum et descende, ne occupet te pluvia.
45 Cumque se verteret huc atque illuc, ecce cæli contenebrati sunt, et nubes, et ventus, et facta est pluvia grandis. Ascendens itaque Achab, abiit in Jezrahel:
46 et manus Domini facta est super Eliam, accinctisque lumbis currebat ante Achab, donec veniret in Jezrahel.


# Βασιλειῶν Γʹ 18 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο με{Q'} ἡμέρας πολλὰς καὶ ῥῆμα κυρίου ἐγένετο πρὸς Ηλιου ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ τρίτῳ λέγων πορεύθητι καὶ ὄφθητι τῷ Αχααβ καὶ δώσω ὑετὸν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς
2 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ηλιου τοῦ ὀφθῆναι τῷ Αχααβ καὶ ἡ λιμὸς κραταιὰ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ
3 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Αχααβ τὸν Αβδιου τὸν οἰκονόμον καὶ Αβδιου ἦν φοβούμενος τὸν κύριον σφόδρα
4 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ τύπτειν τὴν Ιεζαβελ τοὺς προφήτας κυρίου καὶ ἔλαβεν Αβδιου ἑκατὸν ἄνδρας προφήτας καὶ ἔκρυψεν αὐτοὺς κατὰ πεντήκοντα ἐν σπηλαίῳ καὶ διέτρεφεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἄρτῳ καὶ ὕδατι
5 καὶ εἶπεν Αχααβ πρὸς Αβδιου δεῦρο καὶ διέλθωμεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐπὶ πηγὰς τῶν ὑδάτων καὶ ἐπὶ χειμάρρους ἐάν πως εὕρωμεν βοτάνην καὶ περιποιησώμεθα ἵππους καὶ ἡμιόνους καὶ οὐκ ἐξολοθρευθήσονται ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν
6 καὶ ἐμέρισαν ἑαυτοῖς τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ διελθεῖν αὐτήν Αχααβ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ μιᾷ μόνος καὶ Αβδιου ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ ἄλλῃ μόνος
7 καὶ ἦν Αβδιου ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ μόνος καὶ ἦλθεν Ηλιου εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῦ μόνος καὶ Αβδιου ἔσπευσεν καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν εἰ σὺ εἶ αὐτός κύριέ μου Ηλιου
8 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου αὐτῷ ἐγώ πορεύου λέγε τῷ κυρίῳ σου ἰδοὺ Ηλιου

9 καὶ εἶπεν Αβδιου τί ἡμάρτηκα ὅτι δίδως τὸν δοῦλόν σου εἰς χεῖρα Αχααβ τοῦ θανατῶσαί με
10 ζῇ κύριος ὁ θεός σου εἰ ἔστιν ἔθνος ἢ βασιλεία οὗ οὐκ ἀπέσταλκεν ὁ κύριός μου ζητεῖν σε καὶ εἶπον οὐκ ἔστιν καὶ ἐνέπρησεν τὴν βασιλείαν καὶ τὰς χώρας αὐτῆς ὅτι οὐχ εὕρηκέν σε
11 καὶ νῦν σὺ λέγεις πορεύου ἀνάγγελλε τῷ κυρίῳ σου ἰδοὺ Ηλιου
12 καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν ἐγὼ ἀπέλθω ἀπὸ σοῦ καὶ πνεῦμα κυρίου ἀρεῖ σε εἰς γῆν ἣν οὐκ οἶδα καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι ἀπαγγεῖλαι τῷ Αχααβ καὶ ἀποκτενεῖ με καὶ ὁ δοῦλός σού ἐστιν φοβούμενος τὸν κύριον ἐκ νεότητος αὐτοῦ
13 ἦ οὐκ ἀπηγγέλη σοι τῷ κυρίῳ μου οἷα πεποίηκα ἐν τῷ ἀποκτείνειν Ιεζαβελ τοὺς προφήτας κυρίου καὶ ἔκρυψα ἀπὸ τῶν προφητῶν κυρίου ἑκατὸν ἄνδρας ἀνὰ πεντήκοντα ἐν σπηλαίῳ καὶ ἔθρεψα ἐν ἄρτοις καὶ ὕδατι
14 καὶ νῦν σὺ λέγεις μοι πορεύου λέγε τῷ κυρίῳ σου ἰδοὺ Ηλιου καὶ ἀποκτενεῖ με
15 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου ζῇ κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ᾧ παρέστην ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ὅτι σήμερον ὀφθήσομαι αὐτῷ

16 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Αβδιου εἰς συναντὴν τῷ Αχααβ καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐξέδραμεν Αχααβ καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς συνάντησιν Ηλιου
17 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδεν Αχααβ τὸν Ηλιου καὶ εἶπεν Αχααβ πρὸς Ηλιου εἰ σὺ εἶ αὐτὸς ὁ διαστρέφων τὸν Ισραηλ
18 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου οὐ διαστρέφω τὸν Ισραηλ ὅτι ἀλ{L'} ἢ σὺ καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός σου ἐν τῷ καταλιμπάνειν ὑμᾶς τὸν κύριον θεὸν ὑμῶν καὶ ἐπορεύθης ὀπίσω τῶν Βααλιμ
19 καὶ νῦν ἀπόστειλον συνάθροισον πρός με πάντα Ισραηλ εἰς ὄρος τὸ Καρμήλιον καὶ τοὺς προφήτας τῆς αἰσχύνης τετρακοσίους καὶ πεντήκοντα καὶ τοὺς προφήτας τῶν ἀλσῶν τετρακοσίους ἐσθίοντας τράπεζαν Ιεζαβελ
20 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Αχααβ εἰς πάντα Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπισυνήγαγεν πάντας τοὺς προφήτας εἰς ὄρος τὸ Καρμήλιον

21 καὶ προσήγαγεν Ηλιου πρὸς πάντας καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ηλιου ἕως πότε ὑμεῖς χωλανεῖτε ἐ{P'} ἀμφοτέραις ταῖς ἰγνύαις εἰ ἔστιν κύριος ὁ θεός πορεύεσθε ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ εἰ δὲ ὁ Βααλ αὐτός πορεύεσθε ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ λαὸς λόγον
22 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου πρὸς τὸν λαόν ἐγὼ ὑπολέλειμμαι προφήτης τοῦ κυρίου μονώτατος καὶ οἱ προφῆται τοῦ Βααλ τετρακόσιοι καὶ πεντήκοντα ἄνδρες καὶ οἱ προφῆται τοῦ ἄλσους τετρακόσιοι
23 δότωσαν ἡμῖν δύο βόας καὶ ἐκλεξάσθωσαν ἑαυτοῖς τὸν ἕνα καὶ μελισάτωσαν καὶ ἐπιθέτωσαν ἐπὶ τῶν ξύλων καὶ πῦρ μὴ ἐπιθέτωσαν καὶ ἐγὼ ποιήσω τὸν βοῦν τὸν ἄλλον καὶ πῦρ οὐ μὴ ἐπιθῶ
24 καὶ βοᾶτε ἐν ὀνόματι θεῶν ὑμῶν καὶ ἐγὼ ἐπικαλέσομαι ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ μου καὶ ἔσται ὁ θεός ὃς ἐὰν ἐπακούσῃ ἐν πυρί οὗτος θεός καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς καὶ εἶπον καλὸν τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησας

25 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου τοῖς προφήταις τῆς αἰσχύνης ἐκλέξασθε ἑαυτοῖς τὸν μόσχον τὸν ἕνα καὶ ποιήσατε πρῶτοι ὅτι πολλοὶ ὑμεῖς καὶ ἐπικαλέσασθε ἐν ὀνόματι θεοῦ ὑμῶν καὶ πῦρ μὴ ἐπιθῆτε
26 καὶ ἔλαβον τὸν μόσχον καὶ ἐποίησαν καὶ ἐπεκαλοῦντο ἐν ὀνόματι τοῦ Βααλ ἐκ πρωίθεν ἕως μεσημβρίας καὶ εἶπον ἐπάκουσον ἡμῶν ὁ Βααλ ἐπάκουσον ἡμῶν καὶ οὐκ ἦν φωνὴ καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀκρόασις καὶ διέτρεχον ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου οὗ ἐποίησαν
27 καὶ ἐγένετο μεσημβρίᾳ καὶ ἐμυκτήρισεν αὐτοὺς Ηλιου ὁ Θεσβίτης καὶ εἶπεν ἐπικαλεῖσθε ἐν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ὅτι θεός ἐστιν ὅτι ἀδολεσχία αὐτῷ ἐστιν καὶ ἅμα μήποτε χρηματίζει αὐτός ἢ μήποτε καθεύδει αὐτός καὶ ἐξαναστήσεται
28 καὶ ἐπεκαλοῦντο ἐν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ καὶ κατετέμνοντο κατὰ τὸν ἐθισμὸν αὐτῶν ἐν μαχαίραις καὶ σειρομάσταις ἕως ἐκχύσεως αἵματος ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
29 καὶ ἐπροφήτευον ἕως οὗ παρῆλθεν τὸ δειλινόν καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ὁ καιρὸς τοῦ ἀναβῆναι τὴν θυσίαν καὶ οὐκ ἦν φωνή καὶ ἐλάλησεν Ηλιου ὁ Θεσβίτης πρὸς τοὺς προφήτας τῶν προσοχθισμάτων λέγων μετάστητε ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ ἐγὼ ποιήσω τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμά μου καὶ μετέστησαν καὶ ἀπῆλθον

30 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου πρὸς τὸν λαόν προσαγάγετε πρός με καὶ προσήγαγεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς πρὸς αὐτόν
31 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ηλιου δώδεκα λίθους κα{T'} ἀριθμὸν φυλῶν τοῦ Ισραηλ ὡς ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγων Ισραηλ ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά σου
32 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν τοὺς λίθους ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου καὶ ἰάσατο τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ κατεσκαμμένον καὶ ἐποίησεν θααλα χωροῦσαν δύο μετρητὰς σπέρματος κυκλόθεν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου
33 καὶ ἐστοίβασεν τὰς σχίδακας ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ὃ ἐποίησεν καὶ ἐμέλισεν τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὰς σχίδακας καὶ ἐστοίβασεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον
34 καὶ εἶπεν λάβετέ μοι τέσσαρας ὑδρίας ὕδατος καὶ ἐπιχέετε ἐπὶ τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς σχίδακας καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως καὶ εἶπεν δευτερώσατε καὶ ἐδευτέρωσαν καὶ εἶπεν τρισσώσατε καὶ ἐτρίσσευσαν
35 καὶ διεπορεύετο τὸ ὕδωρ κύκλῳ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ τὴν θααλα ἔπλησαν ὕδατος

36 καὶ ἀνεβόησεν Ηλιου εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ εἶπεν κύριε ὁ θεὸς Αβρααμ καὶ Ισαακ καὶ Ισραηλ ἐπάκουσόν μου κύριε ἐπάκουσόν μου σήμερον ἐν πυρί καὶ γνώτωσαν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς οὗτος ὅτι σὺ εἶ κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ κἀγὼ δοῦλός σου καὶ διὰ σὲ πεποίηκα τὰ ἔργα ταῦτα
37 ἐπάκουσόν μου κύριε ἐπάκουσόν μου ἐν πυρί καὶ γνώτω ὁ λαὸς οὗτος ὅτι σὺ εἶ κύριος ὁ θεὸς καὶ σὺ ἔστρεψας τὴν καρδίαν τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου ὀπίσω
38 καὶ ἔπεσεν πῦρ παρὰ κυρίου ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ κατέφαγεν τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα καὶ τὰς σχίδακας καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἐν τῇ θααλα καὶ τοὺς λίθους καὶ τὸν χοῦν ἐξέλιξεν τὸ πῦρ
39 καὶ ἔπεσεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπον ἀληθῶς κύριός ἐστιν ὁ θεός αὐτὸς ὁ θεός
40 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου πρὸς τὸν λαόν συλλάβετε τοὺς προφήτας τοῦ Βααλ μηθεὶς σωθήτω ἐξ αὐτῶν καὶ συνέλαβον αὐτούς καὶ κατάγει αὐτοὺς Ηλιου εἰς τὸν χειμάρρουν Κισων καὶ ἔσφαξεν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ

41 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου τῷ Αχααβ ἀνάβηθι καὶ φάγε καὶ πίε ὅτι φωνὴ τῶν ποδῶν τοῦ ὑετοῦ
42 καὶ ἀνέβη Αχααβ τοῦ φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν καὶ Ηλιου ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὸν Κάρμηλον καὶ ἔκυψεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ ἔθηκεν τὸ πρόσωπον ἑαυτοῦ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν γονάτων ἑαυτοῦ
43 καὶ εἶπεν τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὑτοῦ ἀνάβηθι καὶ ἐπίβλεψον ὁδὸν τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν τὸ παιδάριον καὶ εἶπεν οὐκ ἔστιν οὐθέν καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου καὶ σὺ ἐπίστρεψον ἑπτάκι καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν τὸ παιδάριον ἑπτάκι
44 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἑβδόμῳ καὶ ἰδοὺ νεφέλη μικρὰ ὡς ἴχνος ἀνδρὸς ἀνάγουσα ὕδωρ καὶ εἶπεν ἀνάβηθι καὶ εἰπὸν τῷ Αχααβ ζεῦξον τὸ ἅρμα σου καὶ κατάβηθι μὴ καταλάβῃ σε ὁ ὑετός
45 καὶ ἐγένετο ἕως ὧδε καὶ ὧδε καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς συνεσκότασεν νεφέλαις καὶ πνεύματι καὶ ἐγένετο ὑετὸς μέγας καὶ ἔκλαιεν καὶ ἐπορεύετο Αχααβ εἰς Ιεζραελ
46 καὶ χεὶρ κυρίου ἐπὶ τὸν Ηλιου καὶ συνέσφιγξεν τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔτρεχεν ἔμπροσθεν Αχααβ ἕως Ιεζραελ
