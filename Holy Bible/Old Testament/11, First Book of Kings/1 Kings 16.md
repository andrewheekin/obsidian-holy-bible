# First Book of Kings 16 (RSVCE)

1 And the word of theLordcame to Jehu the son of Hanaʹni against Baʹasha, saying,
2 “Since I exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboʹam, and have made my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins,
3 behold, I will utterly sweep away Baʹasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat.
4 Any one belonging to Baʹasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and any one of his who dies in the field the birds of the air shall eat.”
5 Now the rest of the acts of Baʹasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
6 And Baʹasha slept with his fathers, and was buried at Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
7 Moreover the word of theLordcame by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanaʹni against Baʹasha and his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of theLord, provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboʹam, and also because he destroyed it.
### Elah Reigns over Israel
8 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baʹasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned two years.
9 But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah,
10 Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
11 When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he killed all the house of Baʹasha; he did not leave him a single male of his kinsmen or his friends.
12 Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baʹasha, according to the word of theLord, which he spoke against Baʹasha by Jehu the prophet,
13 for all the sins of Baʹasha and the sins of Elah his son which they sinned, and which they made Israel to sin, provoking theLordGod of Israel to anger with their idols.
14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
### Third Dynasty: Zimri Reigns over Israel
15 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibʹbethon, which belonged to the Philistines,
16 and the troops who were encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king”; therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
17 So Omri went up from Gibʹbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
18 And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king’s house, and burned the king’s house over him with fire, and died,
19 because of his sins which he committed, doing evil in the sight of theLord, walking in the way of Jeroboʹam, and for his sin which he committed, making Israel to sin.
20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy which he made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
### Fourth Dynasty: Omri Reigns over Israel
21 Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts; half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.
22 But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri became king.
23 In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel and he reigned for twelve years; six years he reigned in Tirzah.
24 He bought the hill of Samarʹia from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he fortified the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Samarʹia, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.
25 Omri did what was evil in the sight of theLord, and did more evil than all who were before him.
26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, and in the sins which he made Israel to sin, provoking theLord, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols.
27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
28 And Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samarʹia; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
### Ahab Reigns over Israel
29 In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samarʹia twenty-two years.
30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of theLordmore than all that were before him.
31 And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, he took for wife Jezʹebel the daughter of Ethbaʹal king of the Sidoʹnians, and went and served Baʹal, and worshiped him.
32 He erected an altar for Baʹal in the house of Baʹal, which he built in Samarʹia.
33 And Ahab made an Asheʹrah. Ahab did more to provoke theLord, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
34 In his days Hiʹel of Bethel built Jericho; he laid its foundation at the cost of Abiʹram his first-born, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of theLord, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 16 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factus est autem sermo Domini ad Jehu filium Hanani contra Baasa, dicens:
2 Pro eo quod exaltavi te de pulvere, et posui te ducem super populum meum Israël, tu autem ambulasti in via Jeroboam, et peccare fecisti populum meum Israël, ut me irritares in peccatis eorum:
3 ecce ego demetam posteriora Baasa, et posteriora domus ejus, et faciam domum tuam sicut domum Jeroboam filii Nabat.
4 Qui mortuus fuerit de Baasa in civitate, comedent eum canes: et qui mortuus fuerit ex eo in regione, comedent eum volucres cæli.
5 Reliqua autem sermonum Baasa, et quæcumque fecit, et prælia ejus, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Israël?
6 Dormivit ergo Baasa cum patribus suis, sepultusque est in Thersa: et regnavit Ela filius ejus pro eo.
7 Cum autem in manu Jehu filii Hanani prophetæ verbum Domini factum esset contra Baasa, et contra domum ejus, et contra omne malum quod fecerat coram Domino, ad irritandum eum in operibus manuum suarum, ut fieret sicut domus Jeroboam: ob hanc causam occidit eum, hoc est, Jehu filium Hanani prophetam.

8 Anno vigesimo sexto Asa regis Juda, regnavit Ela filius Baasa super Israël in Thersa, duobus annis.
9 Et rebellavit contra eum servus suus Zambri, dux mediæ partis equitum: erat autem Ela in Thersa bibens, et temulentus in domo Arsa præfecti Thersa.
10 Irruens ergo Zambri, percussit et occidit eum, anno vigesimo septimo Asa regis Juda, et regnavit pro eo.
11 Cumque regnasset, et sedisset super solium ejus, percussit omnem domum Baasa, et non dereliquit ex ea mingentem ad parietem: et propinquos et amicos ejus.
12 Delevitque Zambri omnem domum Baasa, juxta verbum Domini quod locutus fuerat ad Baasa in manu Jehu prophetæ,
13 propter universa peccata Baasa, et peccata Ela filii ejus, qui peccaverunt, et peccare fecerunt Israël, provocantes Dominum Deum Israël in vanitatibus suis.
14 Reliqua autem sermonum Ela, et omnia quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Israël?

15 Anno vigesimo septimo Asa regis Juda, regnavit Zambri septem diebus in Thersa: porro exercitus obsidebat Gebbethon urbem Philisthinorum.
16 Cumque audisset rebellasse Zambri, et occidisse regem, fecit sibi regem omnis Israël Amri, qui erat princeps militiæ super Israël in die illa in castris.
17 Ascendit ergo Amri, et omnis Israël cum eo, de Gebbethon, et obsidebant Thersa.
18 Videns autem Zambri quod expugnanda esset civitas, ingressus est palatium, et succendit se cum domo regia: et mortuus est
19 in peccatis suis quæ peccaverat, faciens malum coram Domino, et ambulans in via Jeroboam, et in peccato ejus, quo fecit peccare Israël.
20 Reliqua autem sermonum Zambri, et insidiarum ejus, et tyrannidis, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Israël?

21 Tunc divisus est populus Israël in duas partes: media pars populi sequebatur Thebni filium Gineth, ut constitueret eum regem: et media pars Amri.
22 Prævaluit autem populus qui erat cum Amri, populo qui sequebatur Thebni filium Gineth: mortuusque est Thebni, et regnavit Amri.
23 Anno trigesimo primo Asa regis Juda, regnavit Amri super Israël, duodecim annis: in Thersa regnavit sex annis.
24 Emitque montem Samariæ a Somer duobus talentis argenti: et ædificavit eum, et vocavit nomen civitatis quam exstruxerat, nomine Semer domini montis, Samariam.
25 Fecit autem Amri malum in conspectu Domini, et operatus est nequiter, super omnes qui fuerunt ante eum.
26 Ambulavitque in omni via Jeroboam filii Nabat, et in peccatis ejus quibus peccare fecerat Israël, ut irritaret Dominum Deum Israël in vanitatibus suis.
27 Reliqua autem sermonum Amri, et prælia ejus quæ gessit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Israël?
28 Dormivitque Amri cum patribus suis, et sepultus est in Samaria: regnavitque Achab filius ejus pro eo.

29 Achab vero filius Amri regnavit super Israël anno trigesimo octavo Asa regis Juda. Et regnavit Achab filius Amri super Israël in Samaria viginti et duobus annis.
30 Et fecit Achab filius Amri malum in conspectu Domini super omnes qui fuerunt ante eum.
31 Nec suffecit ei ut ambularet in peccatis Jeroboam filii Nabat: insuper duxit uxorem Jezabel filiam Ethbaal regis Sidoniorum. Et abiit, et servivit Baal, et adoravit eum.
32 Et posuit aram Baal in templo Baal, quod ædificaverat in Samaria,
33 et plantavit lucum: et addidit Achab in opere suo, irritans Dominum Deum Israël super omnes reges Israël qui fuerunt ante eum.

34 In diebus ejus ædificavit Hiel de Bethel Jericho: in Abiram primitivo suo fundavit eam, et in Segub novissimo suo posuit portas ejus, juxta verbum Domini quod locutus fuerat in manu Josue filii Nun.

7 καὶ ἐν χειρὶ Ιου υἱοῦ Ανανι ἐλάλησεν κύριος ἐπὶ Βαασα καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ πᾶσαν τὴν κακίαν ἣν ἐποίησεν ἐνώπιον κυρίου τοῦ παροργίσαι αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ τοῦ εἶναι κατὰ τὸν οἶκον Ιεροβοαμ καὶ ὑπὲρ τοῦ πατάξαι αὐτόν

8 καὶ Ηλα υἱὸς Βαασα ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ Ισραηλ δύο ἔτη ἐν Θερσα

12 κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησεν κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Βαασα πρὸς Ιου τὸν προφήτην
13 περὶ πασῶν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν Βαασα καὶ Ηλα τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ ὡς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ τοῦ παροργίσαι κύριον τὸν θεὸν Ισραηλ ἐν τοῖς ματαίοις αὐτῶν
14 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ηλα καὶ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τῶν βασιλέων Ισραηλ

15 καὶ Ζαμβρι ἐβασίλευσεν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἐν Θερσα καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ Ισραηλ ἐπὶ Γαβαθων τὴν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων
16 καὶ ἤκουσεν ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ λεγόντων συνεστράφη Ζαμβρι καὶ ἔπαισεν τὸν βασιλέα καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν ἐν Ισραηλ τὸν Αμβρι τὸν ἡγούμενον τῆς στρατιᾶς ἐπὶ Ισραηλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ
17 καὶ ἀνέβη Αμβρι καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐκ Γαβαθων καὶ περιεκάθισαν ἐπὶ Θερσα
18 καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς εἶδεν Ζαμβρι ὅτι προκατείλημπται αὐτοῦ ἡ πόλις καὶ εἰσπορεύεται εἰς ἄντρον τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν πυρὶ καὶ ἀπέθανεν
19 ὑπὲρ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτοῦ ὧν ἐποίησεν τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον κυρίου πορευθῆναι ἐν ὁδῷ Ιεροβοαμ υἱοῦ Ναβατ καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ ὡς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ
