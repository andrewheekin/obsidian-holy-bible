# First Book of Kings 11 (RSVCE)

### Solomon’s Errors
1 Now King Solomon loved many foreign women: the daughter of Pharaoh, and Moabite, Ammonite, Eʹdomite, Sidoʹnian, and Hittite women,
2 from the nations concerning which theLordhad said to the people of Israel, “You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods”; Solomon clung to these in love.
3 He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
4 For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not wholly true to theLordhis God, as was the heart of David his father.
5 For Solomon went after Ashʹtoreth the goddess of the Sidoʹnians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
6 So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of theLord, and did not wholly follow theLord, as David his father had done.
7 Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem.
8 And so he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
9 And theLordwas angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from theLord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
10 and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not keep what theLordcommanded.
11 Therefore theLordsaid to Solomon, “Since this has been your mind and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant.
12 Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
13 However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.”
### Adversaries of Solomon
14 And theLordraised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Eʹdomite; he was of the royal house in Edom.
15 For when David was in Edom, and Joʹab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, he slew every male in Edom
16 (for Joʹab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);
17 but Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain Eʹdomites of his father’s servants, Hadad being yet a little child.
18 They set out from Midʹian and came to Paran, and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and assigned him an allowance of food, and gave him land.
19 And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahʹpenes the queen.
20 And the sister of Tahʹpenes bore him Genuʹbath his son, whom Tahʹpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genuʹbath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.
21 But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joʹab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.”
22 But Pharaoh said to him, “What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country?” And he said to him, “Only let me go.”
23 God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliʹada, who had fled from his master Hadadeʹzer king of Zobah.
24 And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, after the slaughter by David; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and made him king in Damascus.
25 He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing mischief as Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
### Jeroboam’s Rebellion
26 Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, an Eʹphraimite of Zerʹedah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruʹah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king.
27 And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father.
28 The man Jeroboʹam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.
29 And at that time, when Jeroboʹam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahiʹjah the Shiʹlonite found him on the road. Now Ahiʹjah had clad himself with a new garment; and the two of them were alone in the open country.
30 Then Ahiʹjah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces.
31 And he said to Jeroboʹam, “Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says theLord, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give you ten tribes
32 (but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),
33 because he has forsaken me, and worshiped Ashʹtoreth the goddess of the Sidoʹnians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and has not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, as David his father did.
34 Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;
35 but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it to you, ten tribes.
36 Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name.
37 And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.
38 And if you will hearken to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.
39 And I will for this afflict the descendants of David, but not for ever.’ ”
40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboʹam; but Jeroboʹam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
### Death of Solomon
41 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
42 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father; and Rehoboʹam his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 11 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Rex autem Salomon adamavit mulieres alienigenas multas, filiam quoque Pharaonis, et Moabitidas, et Ammonitidas, Idumæas, et Sidonias, et Hethæas:
2 de gentibus super quibus dixit Dominus filiis Israël: Non ingrediemini ad eas, neque de illis ingredientur ad vestras: certissime enim avertent corda vestra ut sequamini deos earum. His itaque copulatus est Salomon ardentissimo amore.
3 Fueruntque ei uxores quasi reginæ septingentæ, et concubinæ trecentæ: et averterunt mulieres cor ejus.
4 Cumque jam esset senex, depravatum est cor ejus per mulieres, ut sequeretur deos alienos: nec erat cor ejus perfectum cum Domino Deo suo, sicut cor David patris ejus.
5 Sed colebat Salomon Astarthen deam Sidoniorum, et Moloch idolum Ammonitarum.
6 Fecitque Salomon quod non placuerat coram Domino, et non adimplevit ut sequeretur Dominum sicut David pater ejus.
7 Tunc ædificavit Salomon fanum Chamos idolo Moab in monte qui est contra Jerusalem, et Moloch idolo filiorum Ammon.
8 Atque in hunc modum fecit universis uxoribus suis alienigenis, quæ adolebant thura, et immolabant diis suis.

9 Igitur iratus est Dominus Salomoni, quod aversa esset mens ejus a Domino Deo Israël, qui apparuerat ei secundo,
10 et præceperat de verbo hoc ne sequeretur deos alienos: et non custodivit quæ mandavit ei Dominus.
11 Dixit itaque Dominus Salomoni: Quia habuisti hoc apud te, et non custodisti pactum meum, et præcepta mea quæ mandavi tibi, disrumpens scindam regnum tuum, et dabo illud servo tuo.
12 Verumtamen in diebus tuis non faciam propter David patrem tuum: de manu filii tui scindam illud,
13 nec totum regnum auferam, sed tribum unam dabo filio tuo propter David servum meum, et Jerusalem, quam elegi.

14 Suscitavit autem Dominus adversarium Salomoni Adad Idumæum de semine regio, qui erat in Edom.
15 Cum enim esset David in Idumæa, et ascendisset Joab princeps militiæ ad sepeliendum eos qui fuerant interfecti, et occidisset omnem masculinum in Idumæa
16 (sex enim mensibus ibi moratus est Joab, et omnis Israël, donec interimeret omne masculinum in Idumæa),
17 fugit Adad ipse, et viri Idumæi de servis patris ejus cum eo, ut ingrederetur Ægyptum: erat autem Adad puer parvulus.
18 Cumque surrexissent de Madian, venerunt in Pharan, tuleruntque secum viros de Pharan, et introierunt Ægyptum ad Pharaonem regem Ægypti: qui dedit ei domum, et cibos constituit, et terram delegavit.
19 Et invenit Adad gratiam coram Pharaone valde, in tantum ut daret ei uxorem sororem uxoris suæ germanam Taphnes reginæ.
20 Genuitque ei soror Taphnes Genubath filium, et nutrivit eum Taphnes in domo Pharaonis: eratque Genubath habitans apud Pharaonem cum filiis ejus.

21 Cumque audisset Adad in Ægypto dormisse David cum patribus suis, et mortuum esse Joab principem militiæ, dixit Pharaoni: Dimitte me, ut vadam in terram meam.
22 Dixitque ei Pharao: Qua enim re apud me indiges, ut quæras ire ad terram tuam? At ille respondit: Nulla: sed obsecro te ut dimittas me.
23 Suscitavit quoque ei Deus adversarium Razon filium Eliada, qui fugerat Adarezer regem Soba dominum suum:
24 et congregavit contra eum viros, et factus est princeps latronum cum interficeret eos David: abieruntque Damascum, et habitaverunt ibi, et constituerunt eum regem in Damasco:
25 eratque adversarius Israëli cunctis diebus Salomonis: et hoc est malum Adad, et odium contra Israël: regnavitque in Syria.

26 Jeroboam quoque filius Nabat, Ephrathæus, de Sareda, servus Salomonis, cujus mater erat nomine Sarva, mulier vidua, levavit manum contra regem.
27 Et hæc est causa rebellionis adversus eum, quia Salomon ædificavit Mello, et coæquavit voraginem civitatis David patris sui.
28 Erat autem Jeroboam vir fortis et potens: vidensque Salomon adolescentem bonæ indolis et industrium, constituerat eum præfectum super tributa universæ domus Joseph.
29 Factum est igitur in tempore illo, ut Jeroboam egrederetur de Jerusalem, et inveniret eum Ahias Silonites propheta in via, opertus pallio novo: erant autem duo tantum in agro.
30 Apprehendensque Ahias pallium suum novum quo coopertus erat, scidit in duodecim partes.
31 Et ait ad Jeroboam: Tolle tibi decem scissuras: hæc enim dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Ecce ego scindam regnum de manu Salomonis, et dabo tibi decem tribus.
32 Porro una tribus remanebit ei propter servum meum David, et Jerusalem civitatem, quam elegi ex omnibus tribubus Israël:
33 eo quod dereliquerit me, et adoraverit Astarthen deam Sidoniorum, et Chamos deum Moab, et Moloch deum filiorum Ammon: et non ambulaverit in viis meis, ut faceret justitiam coram me, et præcepta mea et judicia, sicut David pater ejus.
34 Nec auferam omne regnum de manu ejus, sed ducem ponam eum cunctis diebus vitæ suæ, propter David servum meum quem elegi, qui custodivit mandata mea et præcepta mea.
35 Auferam autem regnum de manu filii ejus, et dabo tibi decem tribus:
36 filio autem ejus dabo tribum unam, ut remaneat lucerna David servo meo cunctis diebus coram me in Jerusalem civitate, quam elegi ut esset nomen meum ibi.
37 Te autem assumam, et regnabis super omnia quæ desiderat anima tua, erisque rex super Israël.
38 Si igitur audieris omnia quæ præcepero tibi, et ambulaveris in viis meis, et feceris quod rectum est coram me, custodiens mandata mea et præcepta mea, sicut fecit David servus meus: ero tecum, et ædificabo tibi domum fidelem, quomodo ædificavi David domum: et tradam tibi Israël:
39 et affligam semen David super hoc, verumtamen non cunctis diebus.

40 Voluit ergo Salomon interficere Jeroboam: qui surrexit, et aufugit in Ægyptum ad Sesac regem Ægypti, et fuit in Ægypto usque ad mortem Salomonis.
41 Reliquum autem verborum Salomonis, et omnia quæ fecit, et sapientia ejus, ecce universa scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum Salomonis.
42 Dies autem quos regnavit Salomon in Jerusalem super omnem Israël, quadraginta anni sunt.
43 Dormivitque Salomon cum patribus suis, et sepultus est in civitate David patris sui: regnavitque Roboam filius ejus pro eo.


# Βασιλειῶν Γʹ 11 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμων ἦν φιλογύναιος καὶ ἦσαν αὐτῷ ἄρχουσαι ἑπτακόσιαι καὶ παλλακαὶ τριακόσιαι καὶ ἔλαβεν γυναῖκας ἀλλοτρίας καὶ τὴν θυγατέρα Φαραω Μωαβίτιδας Αμμανίτιδας Σύρας καὶ Ιδουμαίας Χετταίας καὶ Αμορραίας
2 ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν ἀπεῖπεν κύριος τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ οὐκ εἰσελεύσεσθε εἰς αὐτούς καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐκ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς ὑμᾶς μὴ ἐκκλίνωσιν τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν ὀπίσω εἰδώλων αὐτῶν εἰς αὐτοὺς ἐκολλήθη Σαλωμων τοῦ ἀγαπῆσαι
3 
4 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν καιρῷ γήρους Σαλωμων καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ τελεία μετὰ κυρίου θεοῦ αὐτοῦ καθὼς ἡ καρδία Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξέκλιναν αἱ γυναῖκες αἱ ἀλλότριαι τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ὀπίσω θεῶν αὐτῶν
5 τότε ᾠκοδόμησεν Σαλωμων ὑψηλὸν τῷ Χαμως εἰδώλῳ Μωαβ καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῶν εἰδώλῳ υἱῶν Αμμων
6 καὶ τῇ Ἀστάρτῃ βδελύγματι Σιδωνίων
7 καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησεν πάσαις ταῖς γυναιξὶν αὐτοῦ ταῖς ἀλλοτρίαις ἐθυμίων καὶ ἔθυον τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν
8 καὶ ἐποίησεν Σαλωμων τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον κυρίου οὐκ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω κυρίου ὡς Δαυιδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ

9 καὶ ὠργίσθη κύριος ἐπὶ Σαλωμων ὅτι ἐξέκλινεν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ τοῦ ὀφθέντος αὐτῷ δὶς
10 καὶ ἐντειλαμένου αὐτῷ ὑπὲρ τοῦ λόγου τούτου τὸ παράπαν μὴ πορευθῆναι ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων καὶ φυλάξασθαι ποιῆσαι ἃ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ κύριος ὁ θεός
11 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Σαλωμων ἀν{Q'} ὧν ἐγένετο ταῦτα μετὰ σοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐφύλαξας τὰς ἐντολάς μου καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου ἃ ἐνετειλάμην σοι διαρρήσσων διαρρήξω τὴν βασιλείαν σου ἐκ χειρός σου καὶ δώσω αὐτὴν τῷ δούλῳ σου
12 πλὴν ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις σου οὐ ποιήσω αὐτὰ διὰ Δαυιδ τὸν πατέρα σου ἐκ χειρὸς υἱοῦ σου λήμψομαι αὐτήν
13 πλὴν ὅλην τὴν βασιλείαν οὐ μὴ λάβω σκῆπτρον ἓν δώσω τῷ υἱῷ σου διὰ Δαυιδ τὸν δοῦλόν μου καὶ διὰ Ιερουσαλημ τὴν πόλιν ἣν ἐξελεξάμην

14 καὶ ἤγειρεν κύριος σαταν τῷ Σαλωμων τὸν Αδερ τὸν Ιδουμαῖον καὶ τὸν Εσρωμ υἱὸν Ελιαδαε τὸν ἐν Ραεμμαθ Αδραζαρ βασιλέα Σουβα κύριον αὐτοῦ καὶ συνηθροίσθησαν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν ἄνδρες καὶ ἦν ἄρχων συστρέμματος καὶ προκατελάβετο τὴν Δαμασεκ καὶ ἦσαν σαταν τῷ Ισραηλ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Σαλωμων καὶ Αδερ ὁ Ιδουμαῖος ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος τῆς βασιλείας ἐν Ιδουμαίᾳ
15 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι Δαυιδ τὸν Εδωμ ἐν τῷ πορευθῆναι Ιωαβ ἄρχοντα τῆς στρατιᾶς θάπτειν τοὺς τραυματίας ἔκοψαν πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν ἐν τῇ Ιδουμαίᾳ
16 ὅτι ἓξ μῆνας ἐνεκάθητο ἐκεῖ Ιωαβ καὶ πᾶς Ισραηλ ἐν τῇ Ιδουμαίᾳ ἕως ὅτου ἐξωλέθρευσεν πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν ἐκ τῆς Ιδουμαίας
17 καὶ ἀπέδρα Αδερ αὐτὸς καὶ πάντες ἄνδρες Ιδουμαῖοι τῶν παίδων τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς Αἴγυπτον καὶ Αδερ παιδάριον μικρόν
18 καὶ ἀνίστανται ἄνδρες ἐκ τῆς πόλεως Μαδιαμ καὶ ἔρχονται εἰς Φαραν καὶ λαμβάνουσιν ἄνδρας με{T'} αὐτῶν καὶ ἔρχονται πρὸς Φαραω βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Αδερ πρὸς Φαραω καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ οἶκον καὶ ἄρτους διέταξεν αὐτῷ
19 καὶ εὗρεν Αδερ χάριν ἐναντίον Φαραω σφόδρα καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα ἀδελφὴν τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ ἀδελφὴν Θεκεμινας τὴν μείζω
20 καὶ ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ ἡ ἀδελφὴ Θεκεμινας τῷ Αδερ τὸν Γανηβαθ υἱὸν αὐτῆς καὶ ἐξέθρεψεν αὐτὸν Θεκεμινα ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν Φαραω καὶ ἦν Γανηβαθ ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν Φαραω

21 καὶ Αδερ ἤκουσεν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ὅτι κεκοίμηται Δαυιδ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ὅτι τέθνηκεν Ιωαβ ὁ ἄρχων τῆς στρατιᾶς καὶ εἶπεν Αδερ πρὸς Φαραω ἐξαπόστειλόν με καὶ ἀποστρέψω εἰς τὴν γῆν μου
22 καὶ εἶπεν Φαραω τῷ Αδερ τίνι σὺ ἐλαττονῇ με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ ἰδοὺ σὺ ζητεῖς ἀπελθεῖν εἰς τὴν γῆν σου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Αδερ ὅτι ἐξαποστέλλων ἐξαποστελεῖς με καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν Αδερ εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ
23 
24 
25 αὕτη ἡ κακία ἣν ἐποίησεν Αδερ καὶ ἐβαρυθύμησεν ἐν Ισραηλ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν γῇ Εδωμ

26 καὶ Ιεροβοαμ υἱὸς Ναβατ ὁ Εφραθι ἐκ τῆς Σαριρα υἱὸς γυναικὸς χήρας δοῦλος Σαλωμων
27 καὶ τοῦτο τὸ πρᾶγμα ὡς ἐπήρατο χεῖρας ἐπὶ βασιλέα Σαλωμων ᾠκοδόμησεν τὴν ἄκραν συνέκλεισεν τὸν φραγμὸν τῆς πόλεως Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ
28 καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος Ιεροβοαμ ἰσχυρὸς δυνάμει καὶ εἶδεν Σαλωμων τὸ παιδάριον ὅτι ἀνὴρ ἔργων ἐστίν καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὰς ἄρσεις οἴκου Ιωσηφ
29 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ καὶ Ιεροβοαμ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ εὗρεν αὐτὸν Αχιας ὁ Σηλωνίτης ὁ προφήτης ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ἀπέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ καὶ ὁ Αχιας περιβεβλημένος ἱματίῳ καινῷ καὶ ἀμφότεροι ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ
30 καὶ ἐπελάβετο Αχια τοῦ ἱματίου αὐτοῦ τοῦ καινοῦ τοῦ ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ καὶ διέρρηξεν αὐτὸ δώδεκα ῥήγματα
31 καὶ εἶπεν τῷ Ιεροβοαμ λαβὲ σεαυτῷ δέκα ῥήγματα ὅτι τάδε λέγει κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ῥήσσω τὴν βασιλείαν ἐκ χειρὸς Σαλωμων καὶ δώσω σοι δέκα σκῆπτρα
32 καὶ δύο σκῆπτρα ἔσονται αὐτῷ διὰ τὸν δοῦλόν μου Δαυιδ καὶ διὰ Ιερουσαλημ τὴν πόλιν ἣν ἐξελεξάμην ἐν αὐτῇ ἐκ πασῶν φυλῶν Ισραηλ
33 ἀν{Q'} ὧν κατέλιπέν με καὶ ἐποίησεν τῇ Ἀστάρτῃ βδελύγματι Σιδωνίων καὶ τῷ Χαμως καὶ τοῖς εἰδώλοις Μωαβ καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῶν προσοχθίσματι υἱῶν Αμμων καὶ οὐκ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς μου τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ ὡς Δαυιδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ
34 καὶ οὐ μὴ λάβω ὅλην τὴν βασιλείαν ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ διότι ἀντιτασσόμενος ἀντιτάξομαι αὐτῷ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ διὰ Δαυιδ τὸν δοῦλόν μου ὃν ἐξελεξάμην αὐτόν
35 καὶ λήμψομαι τὴν βασιλείαν ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ δώσω σοι τὰ δέκα σκῆπτρα
36 τῷ δὲ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ δώσω τὰ δύο σκῆπτρα ὅπως ᾖ θέσις τῷ δούλῳ μου Δαυιδ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τῇ πόλει ἣν ἐξελεξάμην ἐμαυτῷ τοῦ θέσθαι ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ
37 καὶ σὲ λήμψομαι καὶ βασιλεύσεις ἐν οἷς ἐπιθυμεῖ ἡ ψυχή σου καὶ σὺ ἔσῃ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τὸν Ισραηλ
38 καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν φυλάξῃς πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐντείλωμαί σοι καὶ πορευθῇς ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς μου καὶ ποιήσῃς τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ τοῦ φυλάξασθαι τὰς ἐντολάς μου καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου καθὼς ἐποίησεν Δαυιδ ὁ δοῦλός μου καὶ ἔσομαι μετὰ σοῦ καὶ οἰκοδομήσω σοι οἶκον πιστόν καθὼς ᾠκοδόμησα τῷ Δαυιδ
39

40 καὶ ἐζήτησεν Σαλωμων θανατῶσαι τὸν Ιεροβοαμ καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἀπέδρα εἰς Αἴγυπτον πρὸς Σουσακιμ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἦν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ἕως οὗ ἀπέθανεν Σαλωμων
41 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν ῥημάτων Σαλωμων καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν φρόνησιν αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γέγραπται ἐν βιβλίῳ ῥημάτων Σαλωμων
42 καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι ἃς ἐβασίλευσεν Σαλωμων ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη
43 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Σαλωμων μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς ἤκουσεν Ιεροβοαμ υἱὸς Ναβατ καὶ αὐτοῦ ἔτι ὄντος ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ὡς ἔφυγεν ἐκ προσώπου Σαλωμων καὶ ἐκάθητο ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ κατευθύνει καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν γῆν Σαριρα τὴν ἐν ὄρει Εφραιμ καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμων ἐκοιμήθη μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ροβοαμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
