# First Book of Kings 14 (RSVCE)

### Judgment on the House of Jeroboam
1 At that time Abiʹjah the son of Jeroboʹam fell sick.
2 And Jeroboʹam said to his wife, “Arise, and disguise yourself, that it be not known that you are the wife of Jeroboʹam, and go to Shiloh; behold, Ahiʹjah the prophet is there, who said of me that I should be king over this people.
3 Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will tell you what shall happen to the child.”
4 Jeroboʹam’s wife did so; she arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahiʹjah. Now Ahiʹjah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.
5 And theLordsaid to Ahiʹjah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboʹam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick. Thus and thus shall you say to her.” When she came, she pretended to be another woman.
6 But when Ahiʹjah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboʹam; why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with heavy tidings for you.
7 Go, tell Jeroboʹam, ‘Thus says theLord, the God of Israel: “Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you leader over my people Israel,
8 and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you; and yet you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments, and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my eyes,
9 but you have done evil above all that were before you and have gone and made for yourself other gods, and molten images, provoking me to anger, and have cast me behind your back;
10 therefore behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboʹam, and will cut off from Jeroboʹam every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will utterly consume the house of Jeroboʹam, as a man burns up dung until it is all gone.
11 Any one belonging to Jeroboʹam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and any one who dies in the open country the birds of the air shall eat; for theLordhas spoken it.” ’
12 Arise therefore, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.
13 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboʹam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something pleasing to theLord, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboʹam.
14 Moreover theLordwill raise up for himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboʹam today. And henceforth
15 theLordwill smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and scatter them beyond the Euphraʹtes, because they have made their Asheʹrim, provoking theLordto anger.
16 And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboʹam, which he sinned and which he made Israel to sin.”
### Death of Jeroboam
17 Then Jeroboʹam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. And as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
18 And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of theLord, which he spoke by his servant Ahiʹjah the prophet.
19 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboʹam, how he warred and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
20 And the time that Jeroboʹam reigned was twenty-two years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
### Rehoboam Reigns over Judah
21 Now Rehoboʹam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboʹam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which theLordhad chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. His mother’s name was Naʹamah the Ammonitess.
22 And Judah did what was evil in the sight of theLord, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done.
23 For they also built for themselves high places, and pillars, and Asheʹrim on every high hill and under every green tree;
24 and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which theLorddrove out before the people of Israel.
25 In the fifth year of King Rehoboʹam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
26 he took away the treasures of the house of theLordand the treasures of the king’s house; he took away everything. He also took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made;
27 and King Rehoboʹam made in their stead shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.
28 And as often as the king went into the house of theLord, the guard bore them and brought them back to the guardroom.
29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboʹam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
30 And there was war between Rehoboʹam and Jeroboʹam continually.
31 And Rehoboʹam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His mother’s name was Naʹamah the Ammonitess. And Abiʹjam his son reigned in his stead.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In tempore illo ægrotavit Abia filius Jeroboam.
2 Dixitque Jeroboam uxori suæ: Surge, et commuta habitum, ne cognoscaris quod sis uxor Jeroboam, et vade in Silo, ubi est Ahias propheta, qui locutus est mihi quod regnaturus essem super populum hunc.
3 Tolle quoque in manu tua decem panes, et crustulam, et vas mellis, et vade ad illum: ipse enim indicabit tibi quid eventurum sit puero huic.
4 Fecit ut dixerat, uxor Jeroboam: et consurgens abiit in Silo, et venit in domum Ahiæ: at ille non poterat videre, quia caligaverant oculi ejus præ senectute.
5 Dixit autem Dominus ad Ahiam: Ecce uxor Jeroboam ingreditur ut consulat te super filio suo qui ægrotat: hæc et hæc loqueris ei. Cum ergo illa intraret, et dissimularet se esse quæ erat,
6 audivit Ahias sonitum pedum ejus introëuntis per ostium, et ait: Ingredere, uxor Jeroboam: quare aliam te esse simulas? ego autem missus sum ad te durus nuntius.

7 Vade, et dic Jeroboam: Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Quia exaltavi te de medio populi, et dedi te ducem super populum meum Israël,
8 et scidi regnum domus David, et dedi illud tibi, et non fuisti sicut servus meus David, qui custodivit mandata mea, et secutus est me in toto corde suo, faciens quod placitum esset in conspectu meo:
9 sed operatus es mala super omnes qui fuerunt ante te, et fecisti tibi deos alienos et conflatiles, ut me ad iracundiam provocares, me autem projecisti post corpus tuum:
10 idcirco ecce ego inducam mala super domum Jeroboam, et percutiam de Jeroboam mingentem ad parietem, et clausum, et novissimum in Israël: et mundabo reliquias domus Jeroboam, sicut mundari solet fimus usque ad purum.
11 Qui mortui fuerint de Jeroboam in civitate, comedent eos canes: qui autem mortui fuerint in agro, vorabunt eos aves cæli: quia Dominus locutus est.
12 Tu igitur surge, et vade in domum tuam: et in ipso introitu pedum tuorum in urbem, morietur puer,
13 et planget eum omnis Israël, et sepeliet: iste enim solus inferetur de Jeroboam in sepulchrum, quia inventus est super eo sermo bonus a Domino Deo Israël in domo Jeroboam.
14 Constituet autem sibi Dominus regem super Israël, qui percutiet domum Jeroboam in hac die, et in hoc tempore:
15 et percutiet Dominus Deus Israël, sicut moveri solet arundo in aqua: et evellet Israël de terra bona hac, quam dedit patribus eorum, et ventilabit eos trans flumen: quia fecerunt sibi lucos, ut irritarent Dominum.
16 Et tradet Dominus Israël propter peccata Jeroboam, qui peccavit, et peccare fecit Israël.

17 Surrexit itaque uxor Jeroboam, et abiit, et venit in Thersa: cumque illa ingrederetur limen domus, puer mortuus est,
18 et sepelierunt eum. Et planxit eum omnis Israël juxta sermonem Domini, quem locutus est in manu servi sui Ahiæ prophetæ.
19 Reliqua autem verborum Jeroboam, quomodo pugnaverit, et quomodo regnaverit, ecce scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Israël.
20 Dies autem quibus regnavit Jeroboam, viginti duo anni sunt: et dormivit cum patribus suis, regnavitque Nadab filius ejus pro eo.

21 Porro Roboam filius Salomonis regnavit in Juda. Quadraginta et unius anni erat Roboam cum regnare cœpisset: decem et septem annos regnavit in Jerusalem civitate, quam elegit Dominus ut poneret nomen suum ibi, ex omnibus tribubus Israël. Nomen autem matris ejus Naama Ammanitis.
22 Et fecit Judas malum coram Domino, et irritaverunt eum super omnibus quæ fecerant patres eorum in peccatis suis quæ peccaverunt.
23 Ædificaverunt enim et ipsi sibi aras, et statuas, et lucos super omnem collem excelsum, et subter omnem arborem frondosam:
24 sed et effeminati fuerunt in terra, feceruntque omnes abominationes gentium quas attrivit Dominus ante faciem filiorum Israël.
25 In quinto autem anno regni Roboam, ascendit Sesac rex Ægypti in Jerusalem,
26 et tulit thesauros domus Domini, et thesauros regios, et universa diripuit: scuta quoque aurea, quæ fecerat Salomon:
27 pro quibus fecit rex Roboam scuta ærea, et tradidit ea in manum ducum scutariorum, et eorum qui excubabant ante ostium domus regis.
28 Cumque ingrederetur rex in domum Domini, portabant ea qui præeundi habebant officium: et postea reportabant ad armamentarium scutariorum.
29 Reliqua autem sermonum Roboam, et omnia quæ fecit, ecce scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Juda.
30 Fuitque bellum inter Roboam et Jeroboam cunctis diebus.
31 Dormivitque Roboam cum patribus suis, et sepultus est cum eis in civitate David: nomen autem matris ejus Naama Ammanitis: et regnavit Abiam filius ejus pro eo.

29 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ροβοαμ καὶ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ιουδα
30 καὶ πόλεμος ἦν ἀνὰ μέσον Ροβοαμ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Ιεροβοαμ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
31 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ροβοαμ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ θάπτεται μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Αβιου υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
