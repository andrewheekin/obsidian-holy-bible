# First Book of Kings 19 (RSVCE)

### Elijah Flees from Jezebel
1 Ahab told Jezʹebel all that Eliʹjah had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
2 Then Jezʹebel sent a messenger to Eliʹjah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.”
3 Then he was afraid, and he arose and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
4 But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree; and he asked that he might die, saying, “It is enough; now, OLord, take away my life; for I am no better than my fathers.”
5 And he lay down and slept under a broom tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise and eat.”
6 And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank, and lay down again.
7 And the angel of theLordcame again a second time, and touched him, and said, “Arise and eat, else the journey will be too great for you.”
8 And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.
### Elijah Meets God at Horeb
9 And there he came to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of theLordcame to him, and he said to him, “What are you doing here, Eliʹjah?”
10 He said, “I have been very jealous for theLord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.”
11 And he said, “Go forth, and stand upon the mount before theLord.” And behold, theLordpassed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before theLord, but theLordwas not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but theLordwas not in the earthquake;
12 and after the earthquake a fire, but theLordwas not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.
13 And when Eliʹjah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him, and said, “What are you doing here, Eliʹjah?”
14 He said, “I have been very jealous for theLord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.”
15 And theLordsaid to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazʹael to be king over Syria;
16 and Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel; and Eliʹsha the son of Shaphat of Aʹbel-mehoʹlah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.
17 And him who escapes from the sword of Hazʹael shall Jehu slay; and him who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Eliʹsha slay.
18 Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baʹal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.”
### Elisha Becomes Elijah’s Disciple
19 So he departed from there, and found Eliʹsha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. Eliʹjah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him.
20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Eliʹjah, and said, “Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back again; for what have I done to you?”
21 And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Eliʹjah, and ministered to him.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 19 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Nuntiavit autem Achab Jezabel omnia quæ fecerat Elias, et quomodo occidisset universos prophetas gladio.
2 Misitque Jezabel nuntium ad Eliam, dicens: Hæc mihi faciant dii, et hæc addant, nisi hac hora cras posuero animam tuam sicut animam unius ex illis.
3 Timuit ergo Elias, et surgens abiit quocumque eum ferebat voluntas: venitque in Bersabee Juda, et dimisit ibi puerum suum,
4 et perrexit in desertum, viam unius diei. Cumque venisset, et sederet subter unam juniperum, petivit animæ suæ ut moreretur, et ait: Sufficit mihi, Domine: tolle animam meam: neque enim melior sum quam patres mei.
5 Projecitque se, et obdormivit in umbra juniperi: et ecce angelus Domini tetigit eum, et dixit illi: Surge, et comede.
6 Respexit, et ecce ad caput suum subcinericius panis, et vas aquæ: comedit ergo, et bibit, et rursum obdormivit.
7 Reversusque est angelus Domini secundo, et tetigit eum, dixitque illi: Surge, comede: grandis enim tibi restat via.
8 Qui cum surrexisset, comedit et bibit, et ambulavit in fortitudine cibi illius quadraginta diebus et quadraginta noctibus usque ad montem Dei Horeb.

9 Cumque venisset illuc, mansit in spelunca: et ecce sermo Domini ad eum, dixitque illi: Quid hic agis, Elia?
10 At ille respondit: Zelo zelatus sum pro Domino Deo exercituum, quia dereliquerunt pactum tuum filii Israël: altaria tua destruxerunt, prophetas tuos occiderunt gladio, derelictus sum ego solus, et quærunt animam meam ut auferant eam.
11 Et ait ei: Egredere, et sta in monte coram Domino: et ecce Dominus transit. Et spiritus grandis et fortis subvertens montes, et conterens petras, ante Dominum: non in spiritu Dominus. Et post spiritum commotio: non in commotione Dominus.
12 Et post commotionem ignis: non in igne Dominus. Et post ignem sibilus auræ tenuis.
13 Quod cum audisset Elias, operuit vultum suum pallio, et egressus stetit in ostio speluncæ. Et ecce vox ad eum dicens: Quid hic agis, Elia? Et ille respondit:
14 Zelo zelatus sum pro Domino Deo exercituum, quia dereliquerunt pactum tuum filii Israël: altaria tua destruxerunt, prophetas tuos occiderunt gladio, derelictus sum ego solus, et quærunt animam meam ut auferant eam.

15 Et ait Dominus ad eum: Vade, et revertere in viam tuam per desertum in Damascum: cumque perveneris illuc, unges Hazaël regem super Syriam,
16 et Jehu filium Namsi unges regem super Israël: Eliseum autem filium Saphat, qui est de Abelmehula, unges prophetam pro te.
17 Et erit: quicumque fugerit gladium Hazaël, occidet eum Jehu: et quicumque fugerit gladium Jehu, interficiet eum Eliseus.
18 Et derelinquam mihi in Israël septem millia virorum, quorum genua non sunt incurvata ante Baal, et omne os quod non adoravit eum osculans manus.

19 Profectus ergo inde Elias, reperit Eliseum filium Saphat, arantem in duodecim jugis boum. Et ipse in duodecim jugis boum arantibus unus erat: cumque venisset Elias ad eum, misit pallium suum super illum.
20 Qui statim relictis bobus cucurrit post Eliam, et ait: Osculer, oro, patrem meum, et matrem meam, et sic sequar te. Dixitque ei: Vade, et revertere: quod enim meum erat, feci tibi.
21 Reversus autem ab eo, tulit par boum, et mactavit illud, et in aratro boum coxit carnes, et dedit populo, et comederunt: consurgensque abiit, et secutus est Eliam, et ministrabat ei.


# Βασιλειῶν Γʹ 19 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν Αχααβ τῇ Ιεζαβελ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησεν Ηλιου καὶ ὡς ἀπέκτεινεν τοὺς προφήτας ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ
2 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ιεζαβελ πρὸς Ηλιου καὶ εἶπεν εἰ σὺ εἶ Ηλιου καὶ ἐγὼ Ιεζαβελ τάδε ποιήσαι μοι ὁ θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη ὅτι ταύτην τὴν ὥραν αὔριον θήσομαι τὴν ψυχήν σου καθὼς ψυχὴν ἑνὸς ἐξ αὐτῶν
3 καὶ ἐφοβήθη Ηλιου καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἀπῆλθεν κατὰ τὴν ψυχὴν ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς Βηρσαβεε τὴν Ιουδα καὶ ἀφῆκεν τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ
4 καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπορεύθη ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ὁδὸν ἡμέρας καὶ ἦλθεν καὶ ἐκάθισεν ὑπὸ ραθμ ἓν καὶ ᾐτήσατο τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖν καὶ εἶπεν ἱκανούσθω νῦν λαβὲ δὴ τὴν ψυχήν μου ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ κύριε ὅτι οὐ κρείσσων ἐγώ εἰμι ὑπὲρ τοὺς πατέρας μου
5 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη καὶ ὕπνωσεν ἐκεῖ ὑπὸ φυτόν καὶ ἰδού τις ἥψατο αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἀνάστηθι καὶ φάγε
6 καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν Ηλιου καὶ ἰδοὺ πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἐγκρυφίας ὀλυρίτης καὶ καψάκης ὕδατος καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἔφαγεν καὶ ἔπιεν καὶ ἐπιστρέψας ἐκοιμήθη
7 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ὁ ἄγγελος κυρίου ἐκ δευτέρου καὶ ἥψατο αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἀνάστα φάγε ὅτι πολλὴ ἀπὸ σοῦ ἡ ὁδός
8 καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἔφαγεν καὶ ἔπιεν καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν τῇ ἰσχύι τῆς βρώσεως ἐκείνης τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας καὶ τεσσαράκοντα νύκτας ἕως ὄρους Χωρηβ

9 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἐκεῖ εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον καὶ κατέλυσεν ἐκεῖ καὶ ἰδοὺ ῥῆμα κυρίου πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν τί σὺ ἐνταῦθα Ηλιου
10 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου ζηλῶν ἐζήλωκα τῷ κυρίῳ παντοκράτορι ὅτι ἐγκατέλιπόν σε οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τὰ θυσιαστήριά σου κατέσκαψαν καὶ τοὺς προφήτας σου ἀπέκτειναν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ ὑπολέλειμμαι ἐγὼ μονώτατος καὶ ζητοῦσι τὴν ψυχήν μου λαβεῖν αὐτήν
11 καὶ εἶπεν ἐξελεύσῃ αὔριον καὶ στήσῃ ἐνώπιον κυρίου ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἰδοὺ παρελεύσεται κύριος καὶ πνεῦμα μέγα κραταιὸν διαλῦον ὄρη καὶ συντρῖβον πέτρας ἐνώπιον κυρίου οὐκ ἐν τῷ πνεύματι κύριος καὶ μετὰ τὸ πνεῦμα συσσεισμός οὐκ ἐν τῷ συσσεισμῷ κύριος
12 καὶ μετὰ τὸν συσσεισμὸν πῦρ οὐκ ἐν τῷ πυρὶ κύριος καὶ μετὰ τὸ πῦρ φωνὴ αὔρας λεπτῆς κἀκεῖ κύριος
13 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Ηλιου καὶ ἐπεκάλυψεν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ μηλωτῇ ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἐξῆλθεν καὶ ἔστη ὑπὸ τὸ σπήλαιον καὶ ἰδοὺ πρὸς αὐτὸν φωνὴ καὶ εἶπεν τί σὺ ἐνταῦθα Ηλιου
14 καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου ζηλῶν ἐζήλωκα τῷ κυρίῳ παντοκράτορι ὅτι ἐγκατέλιπον τὴν διαθήκην σου οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τὰ θυσιαστήριά σου καθεῖλαν καὶ τοὺς προφήτας σου ἀπέκτειναν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ ὑπολέλειμμαι ἐγὼ μονώτατος καὶ ζητοῦσι τὴν ψυχήν μου λαβεῖν αὐτήν

15 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν πορεύου ἀνάστρεφε εἰς τὴν ὁδόν σου καὶ ἥξεις εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ἐρήμου Δαμασκοῦ καὶ χρίσεις τὸν Αζαηλ εἰς βασιλέα τῆς Συρίας
16 καὶ τὸν Ιου υἱὸν Ναμεσσι χρίσεις εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ισραηλ καὶ τὸν Ελισαιε υἱὸν Σαφατ ἀπὸ Αβελμαουλα χρίσεις εἰς προφήτην ἀντὶ σοῦ
17 καὶ ἔσται τὸν σῳζόμενον ἐκ ῥομφαίας Αζαηλ θανατώσει Ιου καὶ τὸν σῳζόμενον ἐκ ῥομφαίας Ιου θανατώσει Ελισαιε
18 καὶ καταλείψεις ἐν Ισραηλ ἑπτὰ χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν πάντα γόνατα ἃ οὐκ ὤκλασαν γόνυ τῷ Βααλ καὶ πᾶν στόμα ὃ οὐ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ

19 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκεῖθεν καὶ εὑρίσκει τὸν Ελισαιε υἱὸν Σαφατ καὶ αὐτὸς ἠροτρία ἐν βουσίν δώδεκα ζεύγη βοῶν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τοῖς δώδεκα καὶ ἐπῆλθεν ἐ{P'} αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπέρριψε τὴν μηλωτὴν αὐτοῦ ἐ{P'} αὐτόν
20 καὶ κατέλιπεν Ελισαιε τὰς βόας καὶ κατέδραμεν ὀπίσω Ηλιου καὶ εἶπεν καταφιλήσω τὸν πατέρα μου καὶ ἀκολουθήσω ὀπίσω σου καὶ εἶπεν Ηλιου ἀνάστρεφε ὅτι πεποίηκά σοι
21 καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν ἐξόπισθεν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰ ζεύγη τῶν βοῶν καὶ ἔθυσεν καὶ ἥψησεν αὐτὰ ἐν τοῖς σκεύεσι τῶν βοῶν καὶ ἔδωκεν τῷ λαῷ καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω Ηλιου καὶ ἐλειτούργει αὐτῷ
