# First Book of Kings 9 (RSVCE)

### God Appears Again to Solomon
1 When Solomon had finished building the house of theLordand the king’s house and all that Solomon desired to build,
2 theLordappeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
3 And theLordsaid to him, “I have heard your prayer and your supplication, which you have made before me; I have consecrated this house which you have built, and put my name there for ever; my eyes and my heart will be there for all time.
4 And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my ordinances,
5 then I will establish your royal throne over Israel for ever, as I promised David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man upon the throne of Israel.’
6 But if you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,
7 then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and the house which I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
8 And this house will become a heap of ruins; everyone passing by it will be astonished, and will hiss; and they will say, ‘Why has theLorddone thus to this land and to this house?’
9 Then they will say, ‘Because they forsook theLordtheir God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore theLordhas brought all this evil upon them.’ ”
10 At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of theLordand the king’s house,
11 and Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold, as much as he desired, King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
12 But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, they did not please him.
13 Therefore he said, “What kind of cities are these which you have given me, my brother?” So they are called the land of Cabul to this day.
14 Hiram had sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
### Other Acts of Solomon
15 And this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of theLordand his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megidʹdo and Gezer
16 (Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burnt it with fire, and had slain the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it as dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife;
17 so Solomon rebuilt Gezer) and Lower Beth-horʹon
18 and Baʹalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,
19 and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
20 All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perʹizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebʹusites, who were not of the people of Israel—
21 their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel were unable to destroy utterly—these Solomon made a forced levy of slaves, and so they are to this day.
22 But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves; they were the soldiers, they were his officials, his commanders, his captains, his chariot commanders and his horsemen.
23 These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work: five hundred and fifty, who had charge of the people who carried on the work.
24 But Pharaoh’s daughter went up from the city of David to her own house which Solomon had built for her; then he built the Millo.
25 Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built to theLord, burning incense before theLord. So he finished the house.
### Solomon’s Commercial Activity
26 King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Eʹzion-geʹber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
27 And Hiram sent with the fleet his servants, seamen who were familiar with the sea, together with the servants of Solomon;
28 and they went to Ophir, and brought from there gold, to the amount of four hundred and twenty talents; and they brought it to King Solomon.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 9 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem cum perfecisset Salomon ædificium domus Domini, et ædificium regis, et omne quod optaverat et voluerat facere,
2 apparuit ei Dominus secundo, sicut apparuerat ei in Gabaon.
3 Dixitque Dominus ad eum: Exaudivi orationem tuam et deprecationem tuam, quam deprecatus es coram me: sanctificavi domum hanc quam ædificasti, ut ponerem nomen meum ibi in sempiternum, et erunt oculi mei et cor meum ibi cunctis diebus.
4 Tu quoque si ambulaveris coram me sicut ambulavit pater tuus, in simplicitate cordis et in æquitate, et feceris omnia quæ præcepi tibi, et legitima mea et judicia mea servaveris,
5 ponam thronum regni tui super Israël in sempiternum, sicut locutus sum David patri tuo, dicens: Non auferetur vir de genere tuo de solio Israël.
6 Si autem aversione aversi fueritis vos et filii vestri, non sequentes me, nec custodientes mandata mea et cæremonias meas quas proposui vobis, sed abieritis et colueritis deos alienos, et adoraveritis eos:
7 auferam Israël de superficie terræ quam dedi eis, et templum quod sanctificavi nomini meo, projiciam a conspectu meo: eritque Israël in proverbium, et in fabulam cunctis populis.
8 Et domus hæc erit in exemplum: omnis qui transierit per eam, stupebit, et sibilabit, et dicet: Quare fecit Dominus sic terræ huic, et domui huic?
9 Et respondebunt: Quia dereliquerunt Dominum Deum suum, qui eduxit patres eorum de terra Ægypti, et secuti sunt deos alienos, et adoraverunt eos, et coluerunt eos: idcirco induxit Dominus super eos omne malum hoc.

10 Expletis autem annis viginti postquam ædificaverat Salomon duas domos, id est, domum Domini, et domum regis
11 (Hiram rege Tyri præbente Salomoni ligna cedrina et abiegna, et aurum juxta omne quod opus habuerat), tunc dedit Salomon Hiram viginti oppida in terra Galilææ.
12 Et egressus est Hiram de Tyro ut videret oppida quæ dederat ei Salomon, et non placuerunt ei.
13 Et ait: Hæccine sunt civitates quas dedisti mihi, frater? Et appellavit eas terram Chabul, usque in diem hanc.
14 Misit quoque Hiram ad regem Salomonem centum viginti talenta auri.

15 Hæc est summa expensarum quam obtulit rex Salomon ad ædificandam domum Domini et domum suam, et Mello, et murum Jerusalem, et Heser, et Mageddo, et Gazer.
16 Pharao rex Ægypti ascendit, et cepit Gazar, succenditque eam igni, et Chananæum, qui habitabat in civitate, interfecit: et dedit eam in dotem filiæ suæ uxori Salomonis.
17 Ædificavit ergo Salomon Gazer, et Bethoron inferiorem,
18 et Balaath, et Palmiram in terra solitudinis.
19 Et omnes vicos qui ad se pertinebant et erant absque muro, munivit, et civitates curruum et civitates equitum, et quodcumque ei placuit ut ædificaret in Jerusalem, et in Libano, et in omni terra potestatis suæ.
20 Universum populum qui remanserat de Amorrhæis, et Hethæis, et Pherezæis, et Hevæis, et Jebusæis, qui non sunt de filiis Israël:
21 horum filios qui remanserant in terra, quos scilicet non potuerant filii Israël exterminare, fecit Salomon tributarios usque in diem hanc.
22 De filiis autem Israël non constituit Salomon servire quemquam, sed erant viri bellatores, et ministri ejus, et principes, et duces, et præfecti curruum et equorum.
23 Erant autem principes super omnia opera Salomonis præpositi quingenti quinquaginta, qui habebant subjectum populum, et statutis operibus imperabant.
24 Filia autem Pharaonis ascendit de civitate David in domum suam, quam ædificaverat ei Salomon: tunc ædificavit Mello.

25 Offerebat quoque Salomon, tribus vicibus per annos singulos, holocausta et pacificas victimas super altare quod ædificaverat Domino, et adolebat thymiama coram Domino: perfectumque est templum.

26 Classem quoque fecit rex Salomon in Asiongaber, quæ est juxta Ailath in littore maris Rubri, in terra Idumææ.
27 Misitque Hiram in classe illa servos suos viros nauticos et gnaros maris, cum servis Salomonis.
28 Qui cum venissent in Ophir, sumptum inde aurum quadringentorum viginti talentorum, detulerunt ad regem Salomonem.


# Βασιλειῶν Γʹ 9 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς συνετέλεσεν Σαλωμων οἰκοδομεῖν τὸν οἶκον κυρίου καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν πραγματείαν Σαλωμων ὅσα ἠθέλησεν ποιῆσαι
2 καὶ ὤφθη κύριος τῷ Σαλωμων δεύτερον καθὼς ὤφθη ἐν Γαβαων
3 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν κύριος ἤκουσα τῆς φωνῆς τῆς προσευχῆς σου καὶ τῆς δεήσεώς σου ἧς ἐδεήθης ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ πεποίηκά σοι κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν προσευχήν σου ἡγίακα τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ὃν ᾠκοδόμησας τοῦ θέσθαι τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα καὶ ἔσονται οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου ἐκεῖ καὶ ἡ καρδία μου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
4 καὶ σὺ ἐὰν πορευθῇς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ καθὼς ἐπορεύθη Δαυιδ ὁ πατήρ σου ἐν ὁσιότητι καρδίας καὶ ἐν εὐθύτητι καὶ τοῦ ποιεῖν κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἐνετειλάμην αὐτῷ καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου καὶ τὰς ἐντολάς μου φυλάξῃς
5 καὶ ἀναστήσω τὸν θρόνον τῆς βασιλείας σου ἐπὶ Ισραηλ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα καθὼς ἐλάλησα τῷ Δαυιδ πατρί σου λέγων οὐκ ἐξαρθήσεταί σοι ἀνὴρ ἡγούμενος ἐν Ισραηλ
6 ἐὰν δὲ ἀποστραφέντες ἀποστραφῆτε ὑμεῖς καὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ μὴ φυλάξητε τὰς ἐντολάς μου καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου ἃ ἔδωκεν Μωυσῆς ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν καὶ πορευθῆτε καὶ δουλεύσητε θεοῖς ἑτέροις καὶ προσκυνήσητε αὐτοῖς
7 καὶ ἐξαρῶ τὸν Ισραηλ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἧς ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ὃν ἡγίασα τῷ ὀνόματί μου ἀπορρίψω ἐκ προσώπου μου καὶ ἔσται Ισραηλ εἰς ἀφανισμὸν καὶ εἰς λάλημα εἰς πάντας τοὺς λαούς
8 καὶ ὁ οἶκος οὗτος ὁ ὑψηλός πᾶς ὁ διαπορευόμενος δ{I'} αὐτοῦ ἐκστήσεται καὶ συριεῖ καὶ ἐροῦσιν ἕνεκα τίνος ἐποίησεν κύριος οὕτως τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ
9 καὶ ἐροῦσιν ἀν{Q'} ὧν ἐγκατέλιπον κύριον θεὸν αὐτῶν ὃς ἐξήγαγεν τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας καὶ ἀντελάβοντο θεῶν ἀλλοτρίων καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐδούλευσαν αὐτοῖς διὰ τοῦτο ἐπήγαγεν κύριος ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς τὴν κακίαν ταύτην

10 εἴκοσι ἔτη ἐν οἷς ᾠκοδόμησεν Σαλωμων τοὺς δύο οἴκους τὸν οἶκον κυρίου καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως
11 Χιραμ βασιλεὺς Τύρου ἀντελάβετο τοῦ Σαλωμων ἐν ξύλοις κεδρίνοις καὶ ἐν ξύλοις πευκίνοις καὶ ἐν χρυσίῳ καὶ ἐν παντὶ θελήματι αὐτοῦ τότε ἔδωκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Χιραμ εἴκοσι πόλεις ἐν τῇ γῇ τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ
12 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Χιραμ ἐκ Τύρου καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὰς πόλεις ἃς ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ Σαλωμων καὶ οὐκ ἤρεσαν αὐτῷ
13 καὶ εἶπεν τί αἱ πόλεις αὗται ἃς ἔδωκάς μοι ἀδελφέ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτάς ὅριον ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
14 καὶ ἤνεγκεν Χιραμ τῷ Σαλωμων ἑκατὸν καὶ εἴκοσι τάλαντα χρυσίου

27 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Χιραμ ἐν τῇ νηὶ τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ ἄνδρας ναυτικοὺς ἐλαύνειν εἰδότας θάλασσαν μετὰ τῶν παίδων Σαλωμων
