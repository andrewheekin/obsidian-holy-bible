# First Book of Kings 2 (RSVCE)

### David’s Instruction to Solomon
1 When David’s time to die drew near, he charged Solomon his son, saying,
2 “I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong, and show yourself a man,
3 and keep the charge of theLordyour God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn;
4 that theLordmay establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.’
5 “Moreover you know also what Joʹab the son of Zeruʹiah did to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, Abner the son of Ner, and Amaʹsa the son of Jether, whom he murdered, avenging in time of peace blood which had been shed in war, and putting innocent blood upon the girdle about my loins, and upon the sandals on my feet.
6 Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.
7 But deal loyally with the sons of Barzilʹlai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for with such loyalty they met me when I fled from Abʹsalom your brother.
8 And there is also with you Shimʹe-i the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahuʹrim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahanaʹim; but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by theLord, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’
9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for you are a wise man; you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol.”
### Death of David
10 Then David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
11 And the time that David reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
12 So Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was firmly established.
### Solomon Consolidates His Reign
13 Then Adoniʹjah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheʹba the mother of Solomon. And she said, “Do you come peaceably?” He said, “Peaceably.”
14 Then he said, “I have something to say to you.” She said, “Say on.”
15 He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully expected me to reign; however the kingdom has turned about and become my brother’s, for it was his from theLord.
16 And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me.” She said to him, “Say on.”
17 And he said, “Pray ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abʹishag the Shuʹnammite as my wife.”
18 Bathsheʹba said, “Very well; I will speak for you to the king.”
19 So Bathsheʹba went to King Solomon, to speak to him on behalf of Adoniʹjah. And the king rose to meet her, and bowed down to her; then he sat on his throne, and had a seat brought for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right.
20 Then she said, “I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Make your request, my mother; for I will not refuse you.”
21 She said, “Let Abʹishag the Shuʹnammite be given to Adoniʹjah your brother as his wife.”
22 King Solomon answered his mother, “And why do you ask Abʹishag the Shuʹnammite for Adoniʹjah? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother, and on his side are Abiʹathar the priest and Joʹab the son of Zeruʹiah.”
23 Then King Solomon swore by theLord, saying, “God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adoniʹjah his life!
24 Now therefore as theLordlives, who has established me, and placed me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adoniʹjah shall be put to death this day.”
25 So King Solomon sent Benaiʹah the son of Jehoiʹada; and he struck him down, and he died.
26 And to Abiʹathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anʹathoth, to your estate; for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the LordGodbefore David my father, and because you shared in all the affliction of my father.”
27 So Solomon expelled Abiʹathar from being priest to theLord, thus fulfilling the word of theLordwhich he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
28 When the news came to Joʹab—for Joʹab had supported Adoniʹjah although he had not supported Abʹsalom—Joʹab fled to the tent of theLordand caught hold of the horns of the altar.
29 And when it was told King Solomon, “Joʹab has fled to the tent of theLord, and behold, he is beside the altar,” Solomon sent Benaiʹah the son of Jehoiʹada, saying, “Go, strike him down.”
30 So Benaiʹah came to the tent of theLord, and said to him, “The king commands, ‘Come forth.’ ” But he said, “No, I will die here.” Then Benaiʹah brought the king word again, saying, “Thus said Joʹab, and thus he answered me.”
31 The king replied to him, “Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him; and thus take away from me and from my father’s house the guilt for the blood which Joʹab shed without cause.
32 TheLordwill bring back his bloody deeds upon his own head, because, without the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and slew with the sword two men more righteous and better than himself, Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amaʹsa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.
33 So shall their blood come back upon the head of Joʹab and upon the head of his descendants for ever; but to David, and to his descendants, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace from theLordfor evermore.”
34 Then Benaiʹah the son of Jehoiʹada went up, and struck him down and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
35 The king put Benaiʹah the son of Jehoiʹada over the army in place of Joʹab, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiʹathar.
36 Then the king sent and summoned Shimʹe-i, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and do not go forth from there to any place whatever.
37 For on the day you go forth, and cross the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall die; your blood shall be upon your own head.”
38 And Shimʹe-i said to the king, “What you say is good; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” So Shimʹe-i dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
39 But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shimʹe-i’s slaves ran away to Achish, son of Maʹacah, king of Gath. And when it was told Shimʹe-i, “Behold, your slaves are in Gath,”
40 Shimʹe-i arose and saddled an ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his slaves; Shimʹe-i went and brought his slaves from Gath.
41 And when Solomon was told that Shimʹe-i had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned,
42 the king sent and summoned Shimʹe-i, and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by theLord, and solemnly admonish you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you go forth and go to any place whatever, you shall die’? And you said to me, ‘What you say is good; I obey.’
43 Why then have you not kept your oath to theLordand the commandment with which I charged you?”
44 The king also said to Shimʹe-i, “You know in your own heart all the evil that you did to David my father; so theLordwill bring back your evil upon your own head.
45 But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before theLordfor ever.”
46 Then the king commanded Benaiʹah the son of Jehoiʹada; and he went out and struck him down, and he died. So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Appropinquaverunt autem dies David ut moreretur: præcepitque Salomoni filio suo, dicens:
2 Ego ingredior viam universæ terræ: confortare, et esto vir.
3 Et observa custodias Domini Dei tui, ut ambules in viis ejus: ut custodias cæremonias ejus, et præcepta ejus, et judicia, et testimonia, sicut scriptum est in lege Moysi: ut intelligas universa quæ facis, et quocumque te verteris:
4 ut confirmet Dominus sermones suos quos locutus est de me, dicens: Si custodierint filii tui vias suas, et ambulaverint coram me in veritate, in omni corde suo et in omni anima sua, non auferetur tibi vir de solio Israël.

5 Tu quoque nosti quæ fecerit mihi Joab filius Sarviæ, quæ fecerit duobus principibus exercitus Israël, Abner filio Ner, et Amasæ filio Jether: quos occidit, et effudit sanguinem belli in pace, et posuit cruorem prælii in balteo suo qui erat circa lumbos ejus, et in calceamento suo quod erat in pedibus ejus.
6 Facies ergo juxta sapientiam tuam, et non deduces canitiem ejus pacifice ad inferos.
7 Sed et filiis Berzellai Galaaditis reddes gratiam, eruntque comedentes in mensa tua: occurrerunt enim mihi quando fugiebam a facie Absalom fratris tui.
8 Habes quoque apud te Semei filium Gera filii Jemini de Bahurim, qui maledixit mihi maledictione pessima quando ibam ad castra: sed quia descendit mihi in occursum cum transirem Jordanem, et juravi ei per Dominum, dicens: Non te interficiam gladio:
9 tu noli pati eum esse innoxium. Vir autem sapiens es, ut scias quæ facies ei: deducesque canos ejus cum sanguine ad inferos.

10 Dormivit igitur David cum patribus suis, et sepultus est in civitate David.
11 Dies autem quibus regnavit David super Israël, quadraginta anni sunt: in Hebron regnavit septem annis; in Jerusalem, triginta tribus.
12 Salomon autem sedit super thronum David patris sui, et firmatum est regnum ejus nimis.

13 Et ingressus est Adonias filius Haggith ad Bethsabee matrem Salomonis. Quæ dixit ei: Pacificusne est ingressus tuus? Qui respondit: Pacificus.
14 Addiditque: Sermo mihi est ad te. Cui ait: Loquere. Et ille:
15 Tu, inquit, nosti, quia meum erat regnum, et me præposuerat omnis Israël sibi in regem: sed translatum est regnum, et factum est fratris mei: a Domino enim constitutum est ei.
16 Nunc ergo petitionem unam precor a te: ne confundas faciem meam. Quæ dixit ad eum: Loquere.
17 Et ille ait: Precor ut dicas Salomoni regi (neque enim negare tibi quidquam potest) ut det mihi Abisag Sunamitidem uxorem.
18 Et ait Bethsabee: Bene: ego loquar pro te regi.
19 Venit ergo Bethsabee ad regem Salomonem ut loqueretur ei pro Adonia: et surrexit rex in occursum ejus, adoravitque eam, et sedit super thronum suum: positusque est thronus matri regis, quæ sedit ad dexteram ejus.
20 Dixitque ei: Petitionem unam parvulam ego deprecor a te: ne confundas faciem meam. Et dixit ei rex: Pete, mater mea: neque enim fas est ut avertam faciem tuam.
21 Quæ ait: Detur Abisag Sunamitis Adoniæ fratri tuo uxor.
22 Responditque rex Salomon, et dixit matri suæ: Quare postulas Abisag Sunamitidem Adoniæ? postula ei et regnum: ipse est enim frater meus major me, et habet Abiathar sacerdotem, et Joab filium Sarviæ.

23 Juravit itaque rex Salomon per Dominum, dicens: Hæc faciat mihi Deus, et hæc addat, quia contra animam suam locutus est Adonias verbum hoc.
24 Et nunc vivit Dominus, qui firmavit me, et collocavit me super solium David patris mei, et qui fecit mihi domum, sicut locutus est, quia hodie occidetur Adonias.
25 Misitque rex Salomon per manum Banaiæ filii Jojadæ, qui interfecit eum, et mortuus est.
26 Abiathar quoque sacerdoti dixit rex: Vade in Anathoth ad agrum tuum: equidem vir mortis es: sed hodie te non interficiam, quia portasti arcam Domini Dei coram David patre meo, et sustinuisti laborem in omnibus in quibus laboravit pater meus.
27 Ejecit ergo Salomon Abiathar ut non esset sacerdos Domini, ut impleretur sermo Domini quem locutus est super domum Heli in Silo.

28 Venit autem nuntius ad Joab, quod Joab declinasset post Adoniam, et post Salomonem non declinasset: fugit ergo Joab in tabernaculum Domini, et apprehendit cornu altaris.
29 Nuntiatumque est regi Salomoni quod fugisset Joab in tabernaculum Domini, et esset juxta altare: misitque Salomon Banaiam filium Jojadæ, dicens: Vade, interfice eum.
30 Et venit Banaias ad tabernaculum Domini, et dixit ei: Hæc dicit rex: Egredere. Qui ait: Non egrediar, sed hic moriar. Renuntiavit Banaias regi sermonem, dicens: Hæc locutus est Joab, et hæc respondit mihi.
31 Dixitque ei rex: Fac sicut locutus est, et interfice eum, et sepeli: et amovebis sanguinem innocentem qui effusus est a Joab, a me, et a domo patris mei.
32 Et reddet Dominus sanguinem ejus super caput ejus, quia interfecit duos viros justos, melioresque se: et occidit eos gladio, patre meo David ignorante, Abner filium Ner principem militiæ Israël, et Amasam filium Jether principem exercitus Juda:
33 et revertetur sanguis illorum in caput Joab, et in caput seminis ejus in sempiternum. David autem et semini ejus, et domui, et throno illius, sit pax usque in æternum a Domino.
34 Ascendit itaque Banaias filius Jojadæ, et aggressus eum interfecit: sepultusque est in domo sua in deserto.
35 Et constituit rex Banaiam filium Jojadæ pro eo super exercitum, et Sadoc sacerdotem posuit pro Abiathar.

36 Misit quoque rex, et vocavit Semei: dixitque ei: Ædifica tibi domum in Jerusalem, et habita ibi: et non egredieris inde huc atque illuc.
37 Quacumque autem die egressus fueris, et transieris torrentem Cedron, scito te interficiendum: sanguis tuus erit super caput tuum.
38 Dixitque Semei regi: Bonus sermo: sicut locutus est dominus meus rex, sic faciet servus tuus. Habitavit itaque Semei in Jerusalem diebus multis.
39 Factum est autem post annos tres ut fugerent servi Semei ad Achis filium Maacha regem Geth: nuntiatumque est Semei quod servi ejus issent in Geth.
40 Et surrexit Semei, et stravit asinum suum, ivitque ad Achis in Geth ad requirendum servos suos, et adduxit eos de Geth.
41 Nuntiatum est autem Salomoni quod isset Semei in Geth de Jerusalem, et rediisset.
42 Et mittens vocavit eum, dixitque illi: Nonne testificatus sum tibi per Dominum, et prædixi tibi: Quacumque die egressus ieris huc et illuc, scito te esse moriturum: et respondisti mihi: Bonus sermo, quem audivi?
43 quare ergo non custodisti jusjurandum Domini, et præceptum quod præceperam tibi?
44 Dixitque rex ad Semei: Tu nosti omne malum cujus tibi conscium est cor tuum, quod fecisti David patri meo: reddidit Dominus malitiam tuam in caput tuum:
45 et rex Salomon benedictus, et thronus David erit stabilis coram Domino usque in sempiternum.
46 Jussit itaque rex Banaiæ filio Jojadæ, qui egressus, percussit eum, et mortuus est.


# Βασιλειῶν Γʹ 2 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἤγγισαν αἱ ἡμέραι Δαυιδ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτόν καὶ ἐνετείλατο τῷ Σαλωμων υἱῷ αὐτοῦ λέγων
2 ἐγώ εἰμι πορεύομαι ἐν ὁδῷ πάσης τῆς γῆς καὶ ἰσχύσεις καὶ ἔσῃ εἰς ἄνδρα
3 καὶ φυλάξεις τὴν φυλακὴν κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ σου τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ φυλάσσειν τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα καὶ τὰ κρίματα τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν νόμῳ Μωυσέως ἵνα συνίῃς ἃ ποιήσεις κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐντείλωμαί σοι
4 ἵνα στήσῃ κύριος τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ ὃν ἐλάλησεν λέγων ἐὰν φυλάξωσιν οἱ υἱοί σου τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῶν πορεύεσθαι ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν λέγων οὐκ ἐξολεθρευθήσεταί σοι ἀνὴρ ἐπάνωθεν θρόνου Ισραηλ

5 καί γε σὺ ἔγνως ὅσα ἐποίησέν μοι Ιωαβ υἱὸς Σαρουιας ὅσα ἐποίησεν τοῖς δυσὶν ἄρχουσιν τῶν δυνάμεων Ισραηλ τῷ Αβεννηρ υἱῷ Νηρ καὶ τῷ Αμεσσαϊ υἱῷ Ιεθερ καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἔταξεν τὰ αἵματα πολέμου ἐν εἰρήνῃ καὶ ἔδωκεν αἷμα ἀθῷον ἐν τῇ ζώνῃ αὐτοῦ τῇ ἐν τῇ ὀσφύι αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τῷ ὑποδήματι αὐτοῦ τῷ ἐν τῷ ποδὶ αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ ποιήσεις κατὰ τὴν σοφίαν σου καὶ οὐ κατάξεις τὴν πολιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐν εἰρήνῃ εἰς ᾅδου
7 καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Βερζελλι τοῦ Γαλααδίτου ποιήσεις ἔλεος καὶ ἔσονται ἐν τοῖς ἐσθίουσιν τὴν τράπεζάν σου ὅτι οὕτως ἤγγισάν μοι ἐν τῷ με ἀποδιδράσκειν ἀπὸ προσώπου Αβεσσαλωμ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου
8 καὶ ἰδοὺ μετὰ σοῦ Σεμεϊ υἱὸς Γηρα υἱὸς τοῦ Ιεμενι ἐκ Βαουριμ καὶ αὐτὸς κατηράσατό με κατάραν ὀδυνηρὰν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐπορευόμην εἰς παρεμβολάς καὶ αὐτὸς κατέβη εἰς ἀπαντήν μου εἰς τὸν Ιορδάνην καὶ ὤμοσα αὐτῷ ἐν κυρίῳ λέγων εἰ θανατώσω σε ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ
9 καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀθῳώσῃς αὐτόν ὅτι ἀνὴρ σοφὸς εἶ σὺ καὶ γνώσῃ ἃ ποιήσεις αὐτῷ καὶ κατάξεις τὴν πολιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐν αἵματι εἰς ᾅδου

10 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Δαυιδ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ
11 καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι ἃς ἐβασίλευσεν Δαυιδ ἐπὶ τὸν Ισραηλ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη ἐν Χεβρων ἐβασίλευσεν ἔτη ἑπτὰ καὶ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τριάκοντα τρία ἔτη
12 καὶ Σαλωμων ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ υἱὸς ἐτῶν δώδεκα καὶ ἡτοιμάσθη ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ σφόδρα

13 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Αδωνιας υἱὸς Αγγιθ πρὸς Βηρσαβεε μητέρα Σαλωμων καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῇ ἡ δὲ εἶπεν εἰρήνη ἡ εἴσοδός σου καὶ εἶπεν εἰρήνη
14 λόγος μοι πρὸς σέ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ λάλησον
15 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ σὺ οἶδας ὅτι ἐμοὶ ἦν ἡ βασιλεία καὶ ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ ἔθετο πᾶς Ισραηλ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰς βασιλέα καὶ ἐστράφη ἡ βασιλεία καὶ ἐγενήθη τῷ ἀδελφῷ μου ὅτι παρὰ κυρίου ἐγένετο αὐτῷ
16 καὶ νῦν αἴτησιν μίαν ἐγὼ αἰτοῦμαι παρὰ σοῦ μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς τὸ πρόσωπόν σου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Βηρσαβεε λάλει
17 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ εἰπὸν δὴ πρὸς Σαλωμων τὸν βασιλέα ὅτι οὐκ ἀποστρέψει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ σοῦ καὶ δώσει μοι τὴν Αβισακ τὴν Σωμανῖτιν εἰς γυναῖκα
18 καὶ εἶπεν Βηρσαβεε καλῶς ἐγὼ λαλήσω περὶ σοῦ τῷ βασιλεῖ
19 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Βηρσαβεε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Σαλωμων λαλῆσαι αὐτῷ περὶ Αδωνιου καὶ ἐξανέστη ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτῇ καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτὴν καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐτέθη θρόνος τῇ μητρὶ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ
20 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ αἴτησιν μίαν μικρὰν ἐγὼ αἰτοῦμαι παρὰ σοῦ μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς τὸ πρόσωπόν σου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ βασιλεύς αἴτησαι μῆτερ ἐμή ὅτι οὐκ ἀποστρέψω σε
21 καὶ εἶπεν δοθήτω δὲ Αβισακ ἡ Σωμανῖτις τῷ Αδωνια τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου εἰς γυναῖκα
22 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Σαλωμων ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ εἶπεν τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἵνα τί σὺ ᾔτησαι τὴν Αβισακ τῷ Αδωνια καὶ αἴτησαι αὐτῷ τὴν βασιλείαν ὅτι οὗτος ἀδελφός μου ὁ μέγας ὑπὲρ ἐμέ καὶ αὐτῷ Αβιαθαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ αὐτῷ Ιωαβ ὁ υἱὸς Σαρουιας ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος ἑταῖρος

23 καὶ ὤμοσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμων κατὰ τοῦ κυρίου λέγων τάδε ποιήσαι μοι ὁ θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη ὅτι κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ ἐλάλησεν Αδωνιας τὸν λόγον τοῦτον
24 καὶ νῦν ζῇ κύριος ὃς ἡτοίμασέν με καὶ ἔθετό με ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρός μου καὶ αὐτὸς ἐποίησέν μοι οἶκον καθὼς ἐλάλησεν κύριος ὅτι σήμερον θανατωθήσεται Αδωνιας
25 καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν Σαλωμων ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν χειρὶ Βαναιου υἱοῦ Ιωδαε καὶ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτόν καὶ ἀπέθανεν Αδωνιας ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ
26 καὶ τῷ Αβιαθαρ τῷ ἱερεῖ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς ἀπότρεχε σὺ εἰς Αναθωθ εἰς ἀγρόν σου ὅτι ἀνὴρ θανάτου εἶ σὺ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ καὶ οὐ θανατώσω σε ὅτι ἦρας τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης κυρίου ἐνώπιον τοῦ πατρός μου καὶ ὅτι ἐκακουχήθης ἐν ἅπασιν οἷς ἐκακουχήθη ὁ πατήρ μου
27 καὶ ἐξέβαλεν Σαλωμων τὸν Αβιαθαρ τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ἱερέα τοῦ κυρίου πληρωθῆναι τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ηλι ἐν Σηλωμ

28 καὶ ἡ ἀκοὴ ἦλθεν ἕως Ιωαβ τοῦ υἱοῦ Σαρουιας ὅτι Ιωαβ ἦν κεκλικὼς ὀπίσω Αδωνιου καὶ ὀπίσω Σαλωμων οὐκ ἔκλινεν καὶ ἔφυγεν Ιωαβ εἰς τὸ σκήνωμα τοῦ κυρίου καὶ κατέσχεν τῶν κεράτων τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου
29 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαλωμων λέγοντες ὅτι ἔφυγεν Ιωαβ εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ἰδοὺ κατέχει τῶν κεράτων τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σαλωμων πρὸς Ιωαβ λέγων τί γέγονέν σοι ὅτι πέφευγας εἰς τὸ θυσιαστήριον καὶ εἶπεν Ιωαβ ὅτι ἐφοβήθην ἀπὸ προσώπου σου καὶ ἔφυγον πρὸς κύριον καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σαλωμων ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Βαναιου υἱὸν Ιωδαε λέγων πορεύου καὶ ἄνελε αὐτὸν καὶ θάψον αὐτόν
30 καὶ ἦλθεν Βαναιου υἱὸς Ιωδαε πρὸς Ιωαβ εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ κυρίου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεύς ἔξελθε καὶ εἶπεν Ιωαβ οὐκ ἐκπορεύομαι ὅτι ὧδε ἀποθανοῦμαι καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Βαναιας υἱὸς Ιωδαε καὶ εἶπεν τῷ βασιλεῖ λέγων τάδε λελάληκεν Ιωαβ καὶ τάδε ἀποκέκριταί μοι
31 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς πορεύου καὶ ποίησον αὐτῷ καθὼς εἴρηκεν καὶ ἄνελε αὐτὸν καὶ θάψεις αὐτὸν καὶ ἐξαρεῖς σήμερον τὸ αἷμα ὃ δωρεὰν ἐξέχεεν Ιωαβ ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός μου
32 καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν κύριος τὸ αἷμα τῆς ἀδικίας αὐτοῦ εἰς κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ὡς ἀπήντησεν τοῖς δυσὶν ἀνθρώποις τοῖς δικαίοις καὶ ἀγαθοῖς ὑπὲρ αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ ὁ πατήρ μου Δαυιδ οὐκ ἔγνω τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν τὸν Αβεννηρ υἱὸν Νηρ ἀρχιστράτηγον Ισραηλ καὶ τὸν Αμεσσα υἱὸν Ιεθερ ἀρχιστράτηγον Ιουδα
33 καὶ ἐπεστράφη τὰ αἵματα αὐτῶν εἰς κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς κεφαλὴν τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα καὶ τῷ Δαυιδ καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ τῷ θρόνῳ αὐτοῦ γένοιτο εἰρήνη ἕως αἰῶνος παρὰ κυρίου
34 καὶ ἀπήντησεν Βαναιου υἱὸς Ιωδαε τῷ Ιωαβ καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἔθαψεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ
35 καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Βαναιου υἱὸν Ιωδαε ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν στρατηγίαν καὶ ἡ βασιλεία κατωρθοῦτο ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τὸν Σαδωκ τὸν ἱερέα ἔδωκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς ἱερέα πρῶτον ἀντὶ Αβιαθαρ

36 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Σεμεϊ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ οἰκοδόμησον σεαυτῷ οἶκον ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ κάθου ἐκεῖ καὶ οὐκ ἐξελεύσῃ ἐκεῖθεν οὐδαμοῦ
37 καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς ἐξόδου σου καὶ διαβήσῃ τὸν χειμάρρουν Κεδρων γινώσκων γνώσῃ ὅτι θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ τὸ αἷμά σου ἔσται ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλήν σου καὶ ὥρκισεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ
38 καὶ εἶπεν Σεμεϊ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἀγαθὸν τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησας κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ οὕτω ποιήσει ὁ δοῦλός σου καὶ ἐκάθισεν Σεμεϊ ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τρία ἔτη
39 καὶ ἐγενήθη μετὰ τρία ἔτη καὶ ἀπέδρασαν δύο δοῦλοι τοῦ Σεμεϊ πρὸς Αγχους υἱὸν Μααχα βασιλέα Γεθ καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σεμεϊ λέγοντες ἰδοὺ οἱ δοῦλοί σου ἐν Γεθ
40 καὶ ἀνέστη Σεμεϊ καὶ ἐπέσαξε τὴν ὄνον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Γεθ πρὸς Αγχους τοῦ ἐκζητῆσαι τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπορεύθη Σεμεϊ καὶ ἤγαγεν τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ ἐκ Γεθ
41 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαλωμων λέγοντες ὅτι ἐπορεύθη Σεμεϊ ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ εἰς Γεθ καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ
42 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸν Σεμεϊ καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν οὐχὶ ὥρκισά σε κατὰ τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ἐπεμαρτυράμην σοι λέγων ἐν ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἐξέλθῃς ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ πορευθῇς εἰς δεξιὰ ἢ εἰς ἀριστερά γινώσκων γνώσῃ ὅτι θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ
43 καὶ τί ὅτι οὐκ ἐφύλαξας τὸν ὅρκον κυρίου καὶ τὴν ἐντολήν ἣν ἐνετειλάμην κατὰ σοῦ
44 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Σεμεϊ σὺ οἶδας πᾶσαν τὴν κακίαν σου ἣν ἔγνω ἡ καρδία σου ἃ ἐποίησας τῷ Δαυιδ τῷ πατρί μου καὶ ἀνταπέδωκεν κύριος τὴν κακίαν σου εἰς κεφαλήν σου
45 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμων ηὐλογημένος καὶ ὁ θρόνος Δαυιδ ἔσται ἕτοιμος ἐνώπιον κυρίου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
46 καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμων τῷ Βαναια υἱῷ Ιωδαε καὶ ἐξῆλθεν καὶ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτόν καὶ ἀπέθανεν
