# First Book of Kings 13 (RSVCE)

### A Man of God from Judah
1 And behold, a man of God came out of Judah by the word of theLordto Bethel. Jeroboʹam was standing by the altar to burn incense.
2 And the man cried against the altar by the word of theLord, and said, “O altar, altar, thus says theLord: ‘Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiʹah by name; and he shall sacrifice upon you the priests of the high places who burn incense upon you, and men’s bones shall be burned upon you.’ ”
3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign that theLordhas spoken: ‘Behold, the altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.’ ”
4 And when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboʹam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Lay hold of him.” And his hand, which he stretched out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself.
5 The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of theLord.
6 And the king said to the man of God, “Entreat now the favor of theLordyour God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.” And the man of God entreated theLord; and the king’s hand was restored to him, and became as it was before.
7 And the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”
8 And the man of God said to the king, “If you give me half your house, I will not go in with you. And I will not eat bread or drink water in this place;
9 for so was it commanded me by the word of theLord, saying, ‘You shall neither eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way that you came.’ ”
10 So he went another way, and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.
11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel. And his sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words also which he had spoken to the king, they told to their father.
12 And their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” And his sons showed him the way which the man of God who came from Judah had gone.
13 And he said to his sons, “Saddle the ass for me.” So they saddled the ass for him and he mounted it.
14 And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.”
15 Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.”
16 And he said, “I may not return with you, or go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place;
17 for it was said to me by the word of theLord, ‘You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came.’ ”
18 And he said to him, “I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of theLord, saying, ‘Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water.’ ” But he lied to him.
19 So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
20 And as they sat at the table, the word of theLordcame to the prophet who had brought him back;
21 and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, “Thus says theLord, ‘Because you have disobeyed the word of theLord, and have not kept the commandment which theLordyour God commanded you,
22 but have come back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, “Eat no bread, and drink no water”; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.’ ”
23 And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the ass for the prophet whom he had brought back.
24 And as he went away a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his body was thrown in the road, and the ass stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body.
25 And behold, men passed by, and saw the body thrown in the road, and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
26 And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God, who disobeyed the word of theLord; therefore theLordhas given him to the lion, which has torn him and slain him, according to the word which theLordspoke to him.”
27 And he said to his sons, “Saddle the ass for me.” And they saddled it.
28 And he went and found his body thrown in the road, and the ass and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or torn the ass.
29 And the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
30 And he laid the body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”
31 And after he had buried him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
32 For the saying which he cried by the word of theLordagainst the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samarʹia, shall surely come to pass.”
33 After this thing Jeroboʹam did not turn from his evil way, but made priests for the high places again from among all the people; any who would, he consecrated to be priests of the high places.
34 And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboʹam, so as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et ecce vir Dei venit de Juda in sermone Domini in Bethel, Jeroboam stante super altare, et thus jaciente.
2 Et exclamavit contra altare in sermone Domini, et ait: Altare, altare, hæc dicit Dominus: Ecce filius nascetur domui David, Josias nomine, et immolabit super te sacerdotes excelsorum, qui nunc in te thura succendunt: et ossa hominum super te incendet.
3 Deditque in illa die signum, dicens: Hoc erit signum quod locutus est Dominus: ecce altare scindetur, et effundetur cinis qui in eo est.
4 Cumque audisset rex sermonem hominis Dei quem inclamaverat contra altare in Bethel, extendit manum suam de altari, dicens: Apprehendite eum. Et exaruit manus ejus quam extenderat contra eum, nec valuit retrahere eam ad se.
5 Altare quoque scissum est, et effusus est cinis de altari, juxta signum quod prædixerat vir Dei in sermone Domini.
6 Et ait rex ad virum Dei: Deprecare faciem Domini Dei tui, et ora pro me, ut restituatur manus mea mihi. Oravitque vir Dei faciem Domini, et reversa est manus regis ad eum, et facta est sicut prius fuerat.
7 Locutus est autem rex ad virum Dei: Veni mecum domum ut prandeas, et dabo tibi munera.
8 Responditque vir Dei ad regem: Si dederis mihi mediam partem domus tuæ, non veniam tecum, nec comedam panem, neque bibam aquam in loco isto:
9 sic enim mandatum est mihi in sermone Domini præcipientis: Non comedes panem, neque bibes aquam, nec reverteris per viam qua venisti.
10 Abiit ergo per aliam viam, et non est reversus per iter quo venerat in Bethel.

11 Prophetes autem quidam senex habitabat in Bethel: ad quem venerunt filii sui, et narraverunt ei omnia opera quæ fecerat vir Dei illa die in Bethel: et verba quæ locutus fuerat ad regem, narraverunt patri suo.
12 Et dixit eis pater eorum: Per quam viam abiit? Ostenderunt ei filii sui viam per quam abierat vir Dei, qui venerat de Juda.
13 Et ait filiis suis: Sternite mihi asinum. Qui cum stravissent, ascendit,
14 et abiit post virum Dei, et invenit eum sedentem subtus terebinthum: et ait illi: Tune es vir Dei qui venisti de Juda? Respondit ille: Ego sum.
15 Dixitque ad eum: Veni mecum domum, ut comedas panem.
16 Qui ait: Non possum reverti, neque venire tecum: nec comedam panem, neque bibam aquam in loco isto,
17 quia locutus est Dominus ad me in sermone Domini, dicens: Non comedes panem, et non bibes aquam ibi, nec reverteris per viam qua ieris.
18 Qui ait illi: Et ego propheta sum similis tui: et angelus locutus est mihi in sermone Domini, dicens: Reduc eum tecum in domum tuam, ut comedat panem, et bibat aquam. Fefellit eum,
19 et reduxit secum: comedit ergo panem in domo ejus, et bibit aquam.

20 Cumque sederent ad mensam, factus est sermo Domini ad prophetam qui reduxerat eum.
21 Et exclamavit ad virum Dei qui venerat de Juda, dicens: Hæc dicit Dominus: Quia non obediens fuisti ori Domini, et non custodisti mandatum quod præcepit tibi Dominus Deus tuus,
22 et reversus es, et comedisti panem, et bibisti aquam in loco in quo præcepit tibi ne comederes panem neque biberes aquam, non inferetur cadaver tuum in sepulchrum patrum tuorum.

23 Cumque comedisset et bibisset, stravit asinum suum prophetæ quem reduxerat.
24 Qui cum abiisset, invenit eum leo in via, et occidit, et erat cadaver ejus projectum in itinere: asinus autem stabat juxta illum, et leo stabat juxta cadaver.
25 Et ecce viri transeuntes viderunt cadaver projectum in via, et leonem stantem juxta cadaver. Et venerunt, et divulgaverunt in civitate in qua prophetes ille senex habitabat.
26 Quod cum audisset propheta ille qui reduxerat eum de via, ait: Vir Dei est, qui inobediens fuit ori Domini, et tradidit eum Dominus leoni, et confregit eum, et occidit juxta verbum Domini quod locutus est ei.
27 Dixitque ad filios suos: Sternite mihi asinum. Qui cum stravissent,
28 et ille abiisset, invenit cadaver ejus projectum in via, et asinum et leonem stantes juxta cadaver: non comedit leo de cadavere, nec læsit asinum.
29 Tulit ergo prophetes cadaver viri Dei, et posuit illud super asinum, et reversus intulit in civitatem prophetæ senis ut plangeret eum.
30 Et posuit cadaver ejus in sepulchro suo, et planxerunt eum: Heu, heu mi frater!
31 Cumque planxissent eum, dixit ad filios suos: Cum mortuus fuero, sepelite me in sepulchro in quo vir Dei sepultus est: juxta ossa ejus ponite ossa mea.
32 Profecto enim veniet sermo quem prædixit in sermone Domini contra altare quod est in Bethel, et contra omnia fana excelsorum quæ sunt in urbibus Samariæ.

33 Post verba hæc non est reversus Jeroboam de via sua pessima, sed e contrario fecit de novissimis populi sacerdotes excelsorum: quicumque volebat, implebat manum suam, et fiebat sacerdos excelsorum.
34 Et propter hanc causam peccavit domus Jeroboam, et eversa est, et deleta de superficie terræ.

1 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐξ Ιουδα παρεγένετο ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου εἰς Βαιθηλ καὶ Ιεροβοαμ εἱστήκει ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ ἐπιθῦσαι
2 καὶ ἐπεκάλεσεν πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου καὶ εἶπεν θυσιαστήριον θυσιαστήριον τάδε λέγει κύριος ἰδοὺ υἱὸς τίκτεται τῷ οἴκῳ Δαυιδ Ιωσιας ὄνομα αὐτῷ καὶ θύσει ἐπὶ σὲ τοὺς ἱερεῖς τῶν ὑψηλῶν τοὺς ἐπιθύοντας ἐπὶ σὲ καὶ ὀστᾶ ἀνθρώπων καύσει ἐπὶ σέ
3 καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τέρας λέγων τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησεν κύριος λέγων ἰδοὺ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ῥήγνυται καὶ ἐκχυθήσεται ἡ πιότης ἡ ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ
4 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ιεροβοαμ τῶν λόγων τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἐπικαλεσαμένου ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ ἐν Βαιθηλ καὶ ἐξέτεινεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου λέγων συλλάβετε αὐτόν καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐξηράνθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἣν ἐξέτεινεν ἐ{P'} αὐτόν καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνήθη ἐπιστρέψαι αὐτὴν πρὸς ἑαυτόν
5 καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐρράγη καὶ ἐξεχύθη ἡ πιότης ἀπὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου κατὰ τὸ τέρας ὃ ἔδωκεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου
6 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ιεροβοαμ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ θεοῦ δεήθητι τοῦ προσώπου κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ σου καὶ ἐπιστρεψάτω ἡ χείρ μου πρός με καὶ ἐδεήθη ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ προσώπου κυρίου καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν τὴν χεῖρα τοῦ βασιλέως πρὸς αὐτόν καὶ ἐγένετο καθὼς τὸ πρότερον
7 καὶ ἐλάλησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦ θεοῦ εἴσελθε με{T'} ἐμοῦ εἰς οἶκον καὶ ἀρίστησον καὶ δώσω σοι δόμα
8 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἐάν μοι δῷς τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ οἴκου σου οὐκ εἰσελεύσομαι μετὰ σοῦ οὐδὲ μὴ φάγω ἄρτον οὐδὲ μὴ πίω ὕδωρ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ
9 ὅτι οὕτως ἐνετείλατό μοι ἐν λόγῳ κύριος λέγων μὴ φάγῃς ἄρτον καὶ μὴ πίῃς ὕδωρ καὶ μὴ ἐπιστρέψῃς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἐπορεύθης ἐν αὐτῇ
10 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐν ὁδῷ ἄλλῃ καὶ οὐκ ἀνέστρεψεν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἦλθεν ἐν αὐτῇ εἰς Βαιθηλ

11 καὶ προφήτης εἷς πρεσβύτης κατῴκει ἐν Βαιθηλ καὶ ἔρχονται οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐτῷ ἅπαντα τὰ ἔργα ἃ ἐποίησεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐν Βαιθηλ καὶ τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἐλάλησεν τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν
12 καὶ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν λέγων ποίᾳ ὁδῷ πεπόρευται καὶ δεικνύουσιν αὐτῷ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ τὴν ὁδὸν ἐν ᾗ ἀνῆλθεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ὁ ἐλθὼν ἐξ Ιουδα
13 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ ἐπισάξατέ μοι τὸν ὄνον καὶ ἐπέσαξαν αὐτῷ τὸν ὄνον καὶ ἐπέβη ἐ{P'} αὐτόν
14 καὶ ἐπορεύθη κατόπισθεν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ εὗρεν αὐτὸν καθήμενον ὑπὸ δρῦν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ ὁ ἐληλυθὼς ἐξ Ιουδα καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἐγώ
15 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ δεῦρο με{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ φάγε ἄρτον
16 καὶ εἶπεν οὐ μὴ δύνωμαι τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι μετὰ σοῦ οὐδὲ μὴ φάγομαι ἄρτον οὐδὲ πίομαι ὕδωρ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ
17 ὅτι οὕτως ἐντέταλταί μοι ἐν λόγῳ κύριος λέγων μὴ φάγῃς ἄρτον ἐκεῖ καὶ μὴ πίῃς ὕδωρ ἐκεῖ καὶ μὴ ἐπιστρέψῃς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἐπορεύθης ἐν αὐτῇ
18 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν κἀγὼ προφήτης εἰμὶ καθὼς σύ καὶ ἄγγελος λελάληκεν πρός με ἐν ῥήματι κυρίου λέγων ἐπίστρεψον αὐτὸν πρὸς σεαυτὸν εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου καὶ φαγέτω ἄρτον καὶ πιέτω ὕδωρ καὶ ἐψεύσατο αὐτῷ
19 καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτόν καὶ ἔφαγεν ἄρτον καὶ ἔπιεν ὕδωρ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ

20 καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῶν καθημένων ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος κυρίου πρὸς τὸν προφήτην τὸν ἐπιστρέψαντα αὐτὸν
21 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦ θεοῦ τὸν ἥκοντα ἐξ Ιουδα λέγων τάδε λέγει κύριος ἀν{Q'} ὧν παρεπίκρανας τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου καὶ οὐκ ἐφύλαξας τὴν ἐντολήν ἣν ἐνετείλατό σοι κύριος ὁ θεός σου
22 καὶ ἐπέστρεψας καὶ ἔφαγες ἄρτον καὶ ἔπιες ὕδωρ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ ᾧ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς σὲ λέγων μὴ φάγῃς ἄρτον καὶ μὴ πίῃς ὕδωρ οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ τὸ σῶμά σου εἰς τὸν τάφον τῶν πατέρων σου

23 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ φαγεῖν ἄρτον καὶ πιεῖν ὕδωρ καὶ ἐπέσαξεν αὐτῷ τὸν ὄνον καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν
24 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν καὶ εὗρεν αὐτὸν λέων ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτόν καὶ ἦν τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐρριμμένον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ὁ ὄνος εἱστήκει πα{R'} αὐτό καὶ ὁ λέων εἱστήκει παρὰ τὸ σῶμα
25 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄνδρες παραπορευόμενοι καὶ εἶδον τὸ θνησιμαῖον ἐρριμμένον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ὁ λέων εἱστήκει ἐχόμενα τοῦ θνησιμαίου καὶ εἰσῆλθον καὶ ἐλάλησαν ἐν τῇ πόλει οὗ ὁ προφήτης ὁ πρεσβύτης κατῴκει ἐν αὐτῇ
26 καὶ ἤκουσεν ὁ ἐπιστρέψας αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ οὗτός ἐστιν ὃς παρεπίκρανε τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου
27 
28 καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ εὗρεν τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐρριμμένον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ καὶ ὁ ὄνος καὶ ὁ λέων εἱστήκεισαν παρὰ τὸ σῶμα καὶ οὐκ ἔφαγεν ὁ λέων τὸ σῶμα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ οὐ συνέτριψεν τὸν ὄνον
29 καὶ ἦρεν ὁ προφήτης τὸ σῶμα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐπέθηκεν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τὸν ὄνον καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν πόλιν ὁ προφήτης τοῦ θάψαι αὐτὸν
30 ἐν τῷ τάφῳ ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἐκόψαντο αὐτόν οὐαὶ ἀδελφέ
31 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ κόψασθαι αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ λέγων ἐὰν ἀποθάνω θάψατέ με ἐν τῷ τάφῳ τούτῳ οὗ ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ τέθαπται ἐν αὐτῷ παρὰ τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτοῦ θέτε με ἵνα σωθῶσι τὰ ὀστᾶ μου μετὰ τῶν ὀστῶν αὐτοῦ
32 ὅτι γινόμενον ἔσται τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τοῦ ἐν Βαιθηλ καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς οἴκους τοὺς ὑψηλοὺς τοὺς ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ

33 καὶ μετὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο οὐκ ἐπέστρεψεν Ιεροβοαμ ἀπὸ τῆς κακίας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐκ μέρους τοῦ λαοῦ ἱερεῖς ὑψηλῶν ὁ βουλόμενος ἐπλήρου τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγίνετο ἱερεὺς εἰς τὰ ὑψηλά
34 καὶ ἐγένετο τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο εἰς ἁμαρτίαν τῷ οἴκῳ Ιεροβοαμ καὶ εἰς ὄλεθρον καὶ εἰς ἀφανισμὸν ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς
