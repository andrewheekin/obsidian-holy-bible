# First Book of Kings 20 (RSVCE)

### Ahab’s Wars with the Arameans
1 Ben-haʹdad the king of Syria gathered all his army together; thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samarʹia, and fought against it.
2 And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, and said to him, “Thus says Ben-haʹdad:
3 ‘Your silver and your gold are mine; your fairest wives and children also are mine.’ ”
4 And the king of Israel answered, “As you say, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have.”
5 The messengers came again, and said, “Thus says Ben-haʹdad: ‘I sent to you, saying, “Deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children”;
6 nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants, and lay hands on whatever pleases them, and take it away.’ ”
7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, “Mark, now, and see how this man is seeking trouble; for he sent to me for my wives and my children, and for my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him.”
8 And all the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not heed or consent.”
9 So he said to the messengers of Ben-haʹdad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you first demanded of your servant I will do; but this thing I cannot do.’ ” And the messengers departed and brought him word again.
10 Ben-haʹdad sent to him and said, “The gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samarʹia shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.”
11 And the king of Israel answered, “Tell him, ‘Let not him that girds on his armor boast himself as he that puts it off.’ ”
12 When Ben-haʹdad heard this message as he was drinking with the kings in the booths, he said to his men, “Take your positions.” And they took their positions against the city.
### Prophetic Opposition to Ahab
13 And behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says theLord, Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will give it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am theLord.”
14 And Ahab said, “By whom?” He said, “Thus says theLord, By the servants of the governors of the districts.” Then he said, “Who shall begin the battle?” He answered, “You.”
15 Then he mustered the servants of the governors of the districts, and they were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he mustered all the people of Israel, seven thousand.
16 And they went out at noon, while Ben-haʹdad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the thirty-two kings who helped him.
17 The servants of the governors of the districts went out first. And Ben-haʹdad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, “Men are coming out from Samarʹia.”
18 He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.”
19 So these went out of the city, the servants of the governors of the districts, and the army which followed them.
20 And each killed his man; the Syrians fled and Israel pursued them, but Ben-haʹdad king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.
21 And the king of Israel went out, and captured the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.
22 Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, “Come, strengthen yourself, and consider well what you have to do; for in the spring the king of Syria will come up against you.”
### The Arameans Are Defeated
23 And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hills, and so they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
24 And do this: remove the kings, each from his post, and put commanders in their places;
25 and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.” And he hearkened to their voice, and did so.
26 In the spring Ben-haʹdad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
27 And the people of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and went against them; the people of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the country.
28 And a man of God came near and said to the king of Israel, “Thus says theLord, ‘Because the Syrians have said, “TheLordis a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys,” therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am theLord.’ ”
29 And they encamped opposite one another seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the people of Israel smote of the Syrians a hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day.
30 And the rest fled into the city of Aphek; and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men that were left. Ben-haʹdad also fled, and entered an inner chamber in the city.
31 And his servants said to him, “Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will spare your life.”
32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-haʹdad says, ‘Pray, let me live.’ ” And he said, “Does he still live? He is my brother.”
33 Now the men were watching for an omen, and they quickly took it up from him and said, “Yes, your brother Ben-haʹdad.” Then he said, “Go and bring him.” Then Ben-haʹdad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
34 And Ben-haʹdad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you may establish bazaars for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samarʹia.” And Ahab said, “I will let you go on these terms.” So he made a covenant with him and let him go.
### A Prophet Condemns Ahab
35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow at the command of theLord, “Strike me, I pray.” But the man refused to strike him.
36 Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of theLord, behold, as soon as you have gone from me, a lion shall kill you.” And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion met him and killed him.
37 Then he found another man, and said, “Strike me, I pray.” And the man struck him, smiting and wounding him.
38 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.
39 And as the king passed, he cried to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a soldier turned and brought a man to me, and said, ‘Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’
40 And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” The king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.”
41 Then he made haste to take the bandage away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
42 And he said to him, “Thus says theLord, ‘Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.’ ”
43 And the king of Israel went to his house resentful and sullen, and came to Samarʹia.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 20 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Porro Benadad rex Syriæ congregavit omnem exercitum suum, et triginta duos reges secum, et equos, et currus: et ascendens pugnabat contra Samariam, et obsidebat eam.
2 Mittensque nuntios ad Achab regem Israël in civitatem,
3 ait: Hæc dicit Benadad: Argentum tuum, et aurum tuum meum est: et uxores tuæ, et filii tui optimi, mei sunt.
4 Responditque rex Israël: Juxta verbum tuum, domine mi rex, tuus sum ego, et omnia mea.
5 Revertentesque nuntii, dixerunt: Hæc dicit Benadad, qui misit nos ad te: Argentum tuum, et aurum tuum, et uxores tuas, et filios tuos, dabis mihi.
6 Cras igitur hac eadem hora mittam servos meos ad te, et scrutabuntur domum tuam, et domum servorum tuorum: et omne quod eis placuerit, ponent in manibus suis, et auferent.

7 Vocavit autem rex Israël omnes seniores terræ, et ait: Animadvertite, et videte quoniam insidietur nobis: misit enim ad me pro uxoribus meis, et filiis, et pro argento et auro: et non abnui.
8 Dixeruntque omnes majores natu, et universus populus, ad eum: Non audias, neque acquiescas illi.
9 Respondit itaque nuntiis Benadad: Dicite domino meo regi: Omnia propter quæ misisti ad me servum tuum in initio, faciam: hanc autem rem facere non possum.
10 Reversique nuntii retulerunt ei. Qui remisit, et ait: Hæc faciant mihi dii, et hæc addant, si suffecerit pulvis Samariæ pugillis omnis populi qui sequitur me.
11 Et respondens rex Israël, ait: Dicite ei: Ne glorietur, accinctus æque ut discinctus.
12 Factum est autem cum audisset Benadad verbum istud, bibebat ipse et reges in umbraculis: et ait servis suis: Circumdate civitatem. Et circumdederunt eam.

13 Et ecce propheta unus accedens ad Achab regem Israël, ait ei: Hæc dicit Dominus: Certe vidisti omnem multitudinem hanc nimiam? ecce ego tradam eam in manu tua hodie, ut scias quia ego sum Dominus.
14 Et ait Achab: Per quem? Dixitque ei: Hæc dicit Dominus: Per pedissequos principum provinciarum. Et ait: Quis incipiet præliari? Et ille dixit: Tu.
15 Recensuit ergo pueros principum provinciarum, et reperit numerum ducentorum triginta duorum: et recensuit post eos populum, omnes filios Israël, septem millia.
16 Et egressi sunt meridie. Benadad autem bibebat temulentus in umbraculo suo, et reges triginta duo cum eo, qui ad auxilium ejus venerant.
17 Egressi sunt autem pueri principum provinciarum in prima fronte. Misit itaque Benadad: qui nuntiaverunt ei, dicentes: Viri egressi sunt de Samaria.
18 Et ille ait: Sive pro pace veniunt, apprehendite eos vivos: sive ut prælientur, vivos eos capite.
19 Egressi sunt ergo pueri principum provinciarum, ac reliquus exercitus sequebatur:
20 et percussit unusquisque virum qui contra se veniebat: fugeruntque Syri, et persecutus est eos Israël. Fugit quoque Benadad rex Syriæ in equo cum equitibus suis.
21 Necnon egressus rex Israël percussit equos et currus, et percussit Syriam plaga magna.
22 Accedens autem propheta ad regem Israël, dixit ei: Vade, et confortare, et scito, et vide quid facias: sequenti enim anno rex Syriæ ascendet contra te.

23 Servi vero regis Syriæ dixerunt ei: Dii montium sunt dii eorum, ideo superaverunt nos: sed melius est ut pugnemus contra eos in campestribus, et obtinebimus eos.
24 Tu ergo verbum hoc fac: amove reges singulos ab exercitu tuo, et pone principes pro eis:
25 et instaura numerum militum qui ceciderunt de tuis, et equos secundum equos pristinos, et currus secundum currus quos ante habuisti: et pugnabimus contra eos in campestribus, et videbis quod obtinebimus eos. Credidit consilio eorum, et fecit ita.
26 Igitur postquam annus transierat, recensuit Benadad Syros, et ascendit in Aphec ut pugnaret contra Israël.
27 Porro filii Israël recensiti sunt, et acceptis cibariis profecti ex adverso, castraque metati sunt contra eos, quasi duo parvi greges caprarum: Syri autem repleverunt terram.

28 (Et accedens unus vir Dei, dixit ad regem Israël: Hæc dicit Dominus: Quia dixerunt Syri: Deus montium est Dominus, et non est Deus vallium: dabo omnem multitudinem hanc grandem in manu tua, et scietis quia ego sum Dominus.)
29 Dirigebantque septem diebus ex adverso hi atque illi acies, septima autem die commissum est bellum: percusseruntque filii Israël de Syris centum millia peditum in die una.
30 Fugerunt autem qui remanserant in Aphec, in civitatem: et cecidit murus super viginti septem millia hominum qui remanserant. Porro Benadad fugiens ingressus est civitatem, in cubiculum quod erat intra cubiculum.
31 Dixeruntque ei servi sui: Ecce, audivimus quod reges domus Israël clementes sint: ponamus itaque saccos in lumbis nostris, et funiculos in capitibus nostris, et egrediamur ad regem Israël: forsitan salvabit animas nostras.
32 Accinxerunt saccis lumbos suos, et posuerunt funiculos in capitibus suis, veneruntque ad regem Israël, et dixerunt ei: Servus tuus Benadad dicit: Vivat, oro te, anima mea. Et ille ait: Si adhuc vivit, frater meus est.
33 Quod acceperunt viri pro omine: et festinantes rapuerunt verbum ex ore ejus, atque dixerunt: Frater tuus Benadad. Et dixit eis: Ite, et adducite eum ad me. Egressus est ergo ad eum Benadad, et levavit eum in currum suum.
34 Qui dixit ei: Civitates quas tulit pater meus a patre tuo, reddam: et plateas fac tibi in Damasco, sicut fecit pater meus in Samaria, et ego fœderatus recedam a te. Pepigit ergo fœdus, et dimisit eum.

35 Tunc vir quidam de filiis prophetarum dixit ad socium suum in sermone Domini: Percute me. At ille noluit percutere.
36 Cui ait: Quia noluisti audire vocem Domini, ecce recedes a me, et percutiet te leo. Cumque paululum recessisset ab eo, invenit eum leo, atque percussit.
37 Sed et alterum inveniens virum, dixit ad eum: Percute me. Qui percussit eum, et vulneravit.
38 Abiit ergo propheta, et occurrit regi in via, et mutavit aspersione pulveris os et oculos suos.
39 Cumque rex transisset, clamavit ad regem, et ait: Servus tuus egressus est ad præliandum cominus: cumque fugisset vir unus, adduxit eum quidam ad me, et ait: Custodi virum istum: qui si lapsus fuerit, erit anima tua pro anima ejus, aut talentum argenti appendes.
40 Dum autem ego turbatus huc illucque me verterem, subito non comparuit. Et ait rex Israël ad eum: Hoc est judicium tuum, quod ipse decrevisti.
41 At ille statim abstersit pulverem de facie sua, et cognovit eum rex Israël, quod esset de prophetis.
42 Qui ait ad eum: Hæc dicit Dominus: Quia dimisisti virum dignum morte de manu tua, erit anima tua pro anima ejus, et populus tuus pro populo ejus.
43 Reversus est igitur rex Israël in domum suam, audire contemnens, et furibundus venit in Samariam.


# Βασιλειῶν Γʹ 20 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ συνήθροισεν υἱὸς Αδερ πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέβη καὶ περιεκάθισεν ἐπὶ Σαμάρειαν καὶ τριάκοντα καὶ δύο βασιλεῖς με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶς ἵππος καὶ ἅρμα καὶ ἀνέβησαν καὶ περιεκάθισαν ἐπὶ Σαμάρειαν καὶ ἐπολέμησαν ἐ{P'} αὐτήν
2 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς Αχααβ βασιλέα Ισραηλ εἰς τὴν πόλιν
3 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν τάδε λέγει υἱὸς Αδερ τὸ ἀργύριόν σου καὶ τὸ χρυσίον σου ἐμόν ἐστιν καὶ αἱ γυναῖκές σου καὶ τὰ τέκνα σου ἐμά ἐστιν
4 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν καθὼς ἐλάλησας κύριε βασιλεῦ σὸς ἐγώ εἰμι καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐμά
5 καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν οἱ ἄγγελοι καὶ εἶπον τάδε λέγει υἱὸς Αδερ ἐγὼ ἀπέσταλκα πρὸς σὲ λέγων τὸ ἀργύριόν σου καὶ τὸ χρυσίον σου καὶ τὰς γυναῖκάς σου καὶ τὰ τέκνα σου δώσεις ἐμοί
6 ὅτι ταύτην τὴν ὥραν αὔριον ἀποστελῶ τοὺς παῖδάς μου πρὸς σέ καὶ ἐρευνήσουσιν τὸν οἶκόν σου καὶ τοὺς οἴκους τῶν παίδων σου καὶ ἔσται τὰ ἐπιθυμήματα ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῶν ἐ{F'} ἃ ἂν ἐπιβάλωσι τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν καὶ λήμψονται

7 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ πάντας τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους καὶ εἶπεν γνῶτε δὴ καὶ ἴδετε ὅτι κακίαν οὗτος ζητεῖ ὅτι ἀπέσταλκεν πρός με περὶ τῶν γυναικῶν μου καὶ περὶ τῶν υἱῶν μου καὶ περὶ τῶν θυγατέρων μου τὸ ἀργύριόν μου καὶ τὸ χρυσίον μου οὐκ ἀπεκώλυσα ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
8 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαός μὴ ἀκούσῃς καὶ μὴ θελήσῃς
9 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς ἀγγέλοις υἱοῦ Αδερ λέγετε τῷ κυρίῳ ὑμῶν πάντα ὅσα ἀπέσταλκας πρὸς τὸν δοῦλόν σου ἐν πρώτοις ποιήσω τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα τοῦτο οὐ δυνήσομαι ποιῆσαι καὶ ἀπῆραν οἱ ἄνδρες καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν αὐτῷ λόγον
10 καὶ ἀνταπέστειλεν πρὸς αὐτὸν υἱὸς Αδερ λέγων τάδε ποιήσαι μοι ὁ θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη εἰ ἐκποιήσει ὁ χοῦς Σαμαρείας ταῖς ἀλώπεξιν παντὶ τῷ λαῷ τοῖς πεζοῖς μου
11 καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν ἱκανούσθω μὴ καυχάσθω ὁ κυρτὸς ὡς ὁ ὀρθός
12 καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ τὸν λόγον τοῦτον πίνων ἦν αὐτὸς καὶ πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς με{T'} αὐτοῦ ἐν σκηναῖς καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ οἰκοδομήσατε χάρακα καὶ ἔθεντο χάρακα ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν

13 καὶ ἰδοὺ προφήτης εἷς προσῆλθεν τῷ βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν τάδε λέγει κύριος εἰ ἑόρακας πάντα τὸν ὄχλον τὸν μέγαν τοῦτον ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δίδωμι αὐτὸν σήμερον εἰς χεῖρας σάς καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ κύριος
14 καὶ εἶπεν Αχααβ ἐν τίνι καὶ εἶπεν τάδε λέγει κύριος ἐν τοῖς παιδαρίοις τῶν ἀρχόντων τῶν χωρῶν καὶ εἶπεν Αχααβ τίς συνάψει τὸν πόλεμον καὶ εἶπεν σύ
15 καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο Αχααβ τὰ παιδάρια τῶν ἀρχόντων τῶν χωρῶν καὶ ἐγένοντο διακόσιοι καὶ τριάκοντα καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐπεσκέψατο τὸν λαόν πᾶν υἱὸν δυνάμεως ἑξήκοντα χιλιάδας
16 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν μεσημβρίας καὶ υἱὸς Αδερ πίνων μεθύων ἐν Σοκχωθ αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς τριάκοντα καὶ δύο βασιλεῖς συμβοηθοὶ με{T'} αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ ἐξῆλθον παιδάρια ἀρχόντων τῶν χωρῶν ἐν πρώτοις καὶ ἀποστέλλουσιν καὶ ἀπαγγέλλουσιν τῷ βασιλεῖ Συρίας λέγοντες ἄνδρες ἐξεληλύθασιν ἐκ Σαμαρείας
18 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς εἰ εἰς εἰρήνην οὗτοι ἐκπορεύονται συλλάβετε αὐτοὺς ζῶντας καὶ εἰ εἰς πόλεμον ζῶντας συλλάβετε αὐτούς
19 καὶ μὴ ἐξελθάτωσαν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως τὰ παιδάρια ἀρχόντων τῶν χωρῶν καὶ ἡ δύναμις ὀπίσω αὐτῶν
20 ἐπάταξεν ἕκαστος τὸν πα{R'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐδευτέρωσεν ἕκαστος τὸν πα{R'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔφυγεν Συρία καὶ κατεδίωξεν αὐτοὺς Ισραηλ καὶ σῴζεται υἱὸς Αδερ βασιλεὺς Συρίας ἐ{F'} ἵππου ἱππέως
21 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ ἔλαβεν πάντας τοὺς ἵππους καὶ τὰ ἅρματα καὶ ἐπάταξεν πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐν Συρίᾳ
22 καὶ προσῆλθεν ὁ προφήτης πρὸς βασιλέα Ισραηλ καὶ εἶπεν κραταιοῦ καὶ γνῶθι καὶ ἰδὲ τί ποιήσεις ὅτι ἐπιστρέφοντος τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ υἱὸς Αδερ βασιλεὺς Συρίας ἀναβαίνει ἐπὶ σέ

23 καὶ οἱ παῖδες βασιλέως Συρίας εἶπον θεὸς ὀρέων θεὸς Ισραηλ καὶ οὐ θεὸς κοιλάδων διὰ τοῦτο ἐκραταίωσεν ὑπὲρ ἡμᾶς ἐὰν δὲ πολεμήσωμεν αὐτοὺς κα{T'} εὐθύ εἰ μὴ κραταιώσομεν ὑπὲρ αὐτούς
24 καὶ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ποίησον ἀπόστησον τοὺς βασιλεῖς ἕκαστον εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῶν καὶ θοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτῶν σατράπας
25 καὶ ἀλλάξομέν σοι δύναμιν κατὰ τὴν δύναμιν τὴν πεσοῦσαν ἀπὸ σοῦ καὶ ἵππον κατὰ τὴν ἵππον καὶ ἅρματα κατὰ τὰ ἅρματα καὶ πολεμήσομεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς κα{T'} εὐθὺ καὶ κραταιώσομεν ὑπὲρ αὐτούς καὶ ἤκουσεν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν καὶ ἐποίησεν οὕτως
26 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπιστρέψαντος τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο υἱὸς Αδερ τὴν Συρίαν καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς Αφεκα εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ Ισραηλ
27 καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἐπεσκέπησαν καὶ παρεγένοντο εἰς ἀπαντὴν αὐτῶν καὶ παρενέβαλεν Ισραηλ ἐξ ἐναντίας αὐτῶν ὡσεὶ δύο ποίμνια αἰγῶν καὶ Συρία ἔπλησεν τὴν γῆν

28 καὶ προσῆλθεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ εἶπεν τῷ βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ τάδε λέγει κύριος ἀν{Q'} ὧν εἶπεν Συρία θεὸς ὀρέων κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ καὶ οὐ θεὸς κοιλάδων αὐτός καὶ δώσω τὴν δύναμιν τὴν μεγάλην ταύτην εἰς χεῖρα σήν καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ κύριος
29 καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν οὗτοι ἀπέναντι τούτων ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ καὶ προσήγαγεν ὁ πόλεμος καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ισραηλ τὴν Συρίαν ἑκατὸν χιλιάδας πεζῶν μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ
30 καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ κατάλοιποι εἰς Αφεκα εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἔπεσεν τὸ τεῖχος ἐπὶ εἴκοσι καὶ ἑπτὰ χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν τῶν καταλοίπων καὶ υἱὸς Αδερ ἔφυγεν καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ κοιτῶνος εἰς τὸ ταμίειον
31 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ οἶδα ὅτι βασιλεῖς Ισραηλ βασιλεῖς ἐλέους εἰσίν ἐπιθώμεθα δὴ σάκκους ἐπὶ τὰς ὀσφύας ἡμῶν καὶ σχοινία ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς ἡμῶν καὶ ἐξέλθωμεν πρὸς βασιλέα Ισραηλ εἴ πως ζωογονήσει τὰς ψυχὰς ἡμῶν
32 καὶ περιεζώσαντο σάκκους ἐπὶ τὰς ὀσφύας αὐτῶν καὶ ἔθεσαν σχοινία ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν καὶ εἶπον τῷ βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ δοῦλός σου υἱὸς Αδερ λέγει ζησάτω δὴ ἡ ψυχή μου καὶ εἶπεν εἰ ἔτι ζῇ ἀδελφός μού ἐστιν
33 καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἰωνίσαντο καὶ ἔσπευσαν καὶ ἀνέλεξαν τὸν λόγον ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπον ἀδελφός σου υἱὸς Αδερ καὶ εἶπεν εἰσέλθατε καὶ λάβετε αὐτόν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτὸν υἱὸς Αδερ καὶ ἀναβιβάζουσιν αὐτὸν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα
34 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν τὰς πόλεις ἃς ἔλαβεν ὁ πατήρ μου παρὰ τοῦ πατρός σου ἀποδώσω σοι καὶ ἐξόδους θήσεις σαυτῷ ἐν Δαμασκῷ καθὼς ἔθετο ὁ πατήρ μου ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ ἐγὼ ἐν διαθήκῃ ἐξαποστελῶ σε καὶ διέθετο αὐτῷ διαθήκην καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτόν

35 καὶ ἄνθρωπος εἷς ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν τῶν προφητῶν εἶπεν πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου πάταξον δή με καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος πατάξαι αὐτόν
36 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν ἀν{Q'} ὧν οὐκ ἤκουσας τῆς φωνῆς κυρίου ἰδοὺ σὺ ἀποτρέχεις ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ πατάξει σε λέων καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ καὶ εὑρίσκει αὐτὸν λέων καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτόν
37 καὶ εὑρίσκει ἄνθρωπον ἄλλον καὶ εἶπεν πάταξόν με δή καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ὁ ἄνθρωπος πατάξας καὶ συνέτριψεν
38 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ προφήτης καὶ ἔστη τῷ βασιλεῖ Ισραηλ ἐπὶ τῆς ὁδοῦ καὶ κατεδήσατο τελαμῶνι τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ
39 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ὁ βασιλεὺς παρεπορεύετο καὶ οὗτος ἐβόα πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ εἶπεν ὁ δοῦλός σου ἐξῆλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν στρατιὰν τοῦ πολέμου καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ εἰσήγαγεν πρός με ἄνδρα καὶ εἶπεν πρός με φύλαξον τοῦτον τὸν ἄνδρα ἐὰν δὲ ἐκπηδῶν ἐκπηδήσῃ καὶ ἔσται ἡ ψυχή σου ἀντὶ τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ ἢ τάλαντον ἀργυρίου στήσεις
40 καὶ ἐγενήθη περιεβλέψατο ὁ δοῦλός σου ὧδε καὶ ὧδε καὶ οὗτος οὐκ ἦν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ ἰδοὺ καὶ τὰ ἔνεδρα πα{R'} ἐμοὶ ἐφόνευσας
41 καὶ ἔσπευσεν καὶ ἀφεῖλεν τὸν τελαμῶνα ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπέγνω αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ ὅτι ἐκ τῶν προφητῶν οὗτος
42 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν τάδε λέγει κύριος διότι ἐξήνεγκας σὺ ἄνδρα ὀλέθριον ἐκ χειρός σου καὶ ἔσται ἡ ψυχή σου ἀντὶ τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ λαός σου ἀντὶ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ
43 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ συγκεχυμένος καὶ ἐκλελυμένος καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς Σαμάρειαν
