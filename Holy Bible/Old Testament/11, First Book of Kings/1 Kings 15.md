# First Book of Kings 15 (RSVCE)

### Abijam Reigns over Judah: Idolatry and War
1 Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, Abiʹjam began to reign over Judah.
2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maʹacah the daughter of Abishʹalom.
3 And he walked in all the sins which his father did before him; and his heart was not wholly true to theLordhis God, as the heart of David his father.
4 Nevertheless for David’s sake theLordhis God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem;
5 because David did what was right in the eyes of theLord, and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriʹah the Hittite.
6 Now there was war between Rehoboʹam and Jeroboʹam all the days of his life.
7 The rest of the acts of Abiʹjam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abiʹjam and Jeroboʹam.
8 And Abiʹjam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his stead.
### Asa Reigns over Judah
9 In the twentieth year of Jeroboʹam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah,
10 and he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maʹacah the daughter of Abishʹalom.
11 And Asa did what was right in the eyes of theLord, as David his father had done.
12 He put away the male cult prostitutes out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
13 He also removed Maʹacah his mother from being queen mother because she had an abominable image made for Asheʹrah; and Asa cut down her image and burned it at the brook Kidron.
14 But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was wholly true to theLordall his days.
15 And he brought into the house of theLordthe votive gifts of his father and his own votive gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels.
### Alliance with Aram against Israel
16 And there was war between Asa and Baʹasha king of Israel all their days.
17 Baʹasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of theLordand the treasures of the king’s house, and gave them into the hands of his servants; and King Asa sent them to Ben-haʹdad the son of Tabrimʹmon, the son of Heʹzi-on, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,
19 “Let there be a league between me and you, as between my father and your father: behold, I am sending to you a present of silver and gold; go, break your league with Baʹasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.”
20 And Ben-haʹdad hearkened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Aʹbel-beth-maʹacah, and all Chinʹneroth, with all the land of Naphʹtali.
21 And when Baʹasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and he dwelt in Tirzah.
22 Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah, none was exempt, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baʹasha had been building; and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.
23 Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet.
24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshʹaphat his son reigned in his stead.
### Nadab Reigns over Israel
25 Nadab the son of Jeroboʹam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.
26 He did what was evil in the sight of theLord, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin which he made Israel to sin.
27 Baʹasha the son of Ahiʹjah, of the house of Isʹsachar, conspired against him; and Baʹasha struck him down at Gibʹbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibʹbethon.
28 So Baʹasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
29 And as soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jeroboʹam; he left to the house of Jeroboʹam not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of theLordwhich he spoke by his servant Ahiʹjah the Shiʹlonite;
30 it was for the sins of Jeroboʹam which he sinned and which he made Israel to sin, and because of the anger to which he provoked theLord, the God of Israel.
31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
32 And there was war between Asa and Baʹasha king of Israel all their days.
### Second Dynasty: Baasha Reigns over Israel
33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baʹasha the son of Ahiʹjah began to reign over all Israel at Tirzah, and he reigned twenty-four years.
34 He did what was evil in the sight of theLord, and walked in the way of Jeroboʹam and in his sin which he made Israel to sin.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 15 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Igitur in octavodecimo anno regni Jeroboam filii Nabat, regnavit Abiam super Judam.
2 Tribus annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Maacha filia Abessalom.
3 Ambulavitque in omnibus peccatis patris sui, quæ fecerat ante eum: nec erat cor ejus perfectum cum Domino Deo suo, sicut cor David patris ejus.
4 Sed propter David dedit ei Dominus Deus suus lucernam in Jerusalem, ut suscitaret filium ejus post eum, et statueret Jerusalem:
5 eo quod fecisset David rectum in oculis Domini, et non declinasset ab omnibus quæ præceperat ei cunctis diebus vitæ suæ, excepto sermone Uriæ Hethæi.
6 Attamen bellum fuit inter Roboam et Jeroboam omni tempore vitæ ejus.
7 Reliqua autem sermonum Abiam, et omnia quæ fecit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Juda? Fuitque prælium inter Abiam et inter Jeroboam.
8 Et dormivit Abiam cum patribus suis, et sepelierunt eum in civitate David, regnavitque Asa filius ejus pro eo.

9 In anno ergo vigesimo Jeroboam regis Israël regnavit Asa rex Juda,
10 et quadraginta et uno anno regnavit in Jerusalem. Nomen matris ejus Maacha filia Abessalom.
11 Et fecit Asa rectum ante conspectum Domini, sicut David pater ejus:
12 et abstulit effeminatos de terra, purgavitque universas sordes idolorum quæ fecerant patres ejus.
13 Insuper et Maacham matrem suam amovit, ne esset princeps in sacris Priapi, et in luco ejus quem consecraverat: subvertitque specum ejus, et confregit simulacrum turpissimum, et combussit in torrente Cedron:
14 excelsa autem non abstulit. Verumtamen cor Asa perfectum erat cum Domino cunctis diebus suis:
15 et intulit ea quæ sanctificaverat pater suus, et voverat, in domum Domini, argentum, et aurum, et vasa.

16 Bellum autem erat inter Asa, et Baasa regem Israël cunctis diebus eorum.
17 Ascendit quoque Baasa rex Israël in Judam, et ædificavit Rama, ut non posset quispiam egredi vel ingredi de parte Asa regis Juda.
18 Tollens itaque Asa omne argentum et aurum quod remanserat in thesauris domus Domini, et in thesauris domus regiæ, et dedit illud in manus servorum suorum: et misit ad Benadad filium Tabremon filii Hezion, regem Syriæ, qui habitabat in Damasco, dicens:
19 Fœdus est inter me et te, et inter patrem meum et patrem tuum: ideo misi tibi munera, argentum et aurum: et peto ut venias, et irritum facias fœdus quod habes cum Baasa rege Israël, et recedat a me.
20 Acquiescens Benadad regi Asa, misit principes exercitus sui in civitates Israël, et percusserunt Ahion, et Dan, et Abeldomum Maacha, et universam Cenneroth, omnem scilicet terram Nephthali.
21 Quod cum audisset Baasa, intermisit ædificare Rama, et reversus est in Thersa.
22 Rex autem Asa nuntium misit in omnem Judam, dicens: Nemo sit excusatus. Et tulerunt lapides de Rama, et ligna ejus, quibus ædificaverat Baasa, et exstruxit de eis rex Asa Gabaa Benjamin, et Maspha.
23 Reliqua autem omnium sermonum Asa, et universæ fortitudines ejus, et cuncta quæ fecit, et civitates quas exstruxit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Juda? Verumtamen in tempore senectutis suæ doluit pedes.
24 Et dormivit cum patribus suis, et sepultus est cum eis in civitate David patris sui. Regnavitque Josaphat filius ejus pro eo.

25 Nadab vero filius Jeroboam regnavit super Israël anno secundo Asa regis Juda: regnavitque super Israël duobus annis.
26 Et fecit quod malum est in conspectu Domini, et ambulavit in viis patris sui, et in peccatis ejus quibus peccare fecit Israël.
27 Insidiatus est autem ei Baasa filius Ahiæ de domo Issachar, et percussit eum in Gebbethon, quæ est urbs Philisthinorum: siquidem Nadab et omnis Israël obsidebant Gebbethon.
28 Interfecit ergo illum Baasa in anno tertio Asa regis Juda, et regnavit pro eo.
29 Cumque regnasset, percussit omnem domum Jeroboam: non dimisit ne unam quidem animam de semine ejus donec deleret eum, juxta verbum Domini quod locutus fuerat in manu servi sui Ahiæ Silonitis,
30 propter peccata Jeroboam, quæ peccaverat, et quibus peccare fecerat Israël: et propter delictum quo irritaverat Dominum Deum Israël.
31 Reliqua autem sermonum Nadab, et omnia quæ operatus est, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Israël?

32 Fuitque bellum inter Asa, et Baasa regem Israël, cunctis diebus eorum.
33 Anno tertio Asa regis Juda, regnavit Baasa filius Ahiæ super omnem Israël in Thersa, viginti quatuor annis.
34 Et fecit malum coram Domino, ambulavitque in via Jeroboam, et in peccatis ejus quibus peccare fecit Israël.

18 καὶ ἔλαβεν Ασα τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ εἰς χεῖρας παίδων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς ὁ βασιλεὺς Ασα πρὸς υἱὸν Αδερ υἱὸν Ταβερεμμαν υἱοῦ Αζιν βασιλέως Συρίας τοῦ κατοικοῦντος ἐν Δαμασκῷ λέγων
