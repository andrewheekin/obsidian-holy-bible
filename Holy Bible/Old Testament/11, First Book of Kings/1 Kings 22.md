# First Book of Kings 22 (RSVCE)

### Joint Campaign with Judah against Aram
1 For three years Syria and Israel continued without war.
2 But in the third year Jehoshʹaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
3 And the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Raʹmoth-gilʹead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?”
4 And he said to Jehoshʹaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Raʹmoth-gilʹead?” And Jehoshʹaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
5 And Jehoshʹaphat said to the king of Israel, “Inquire first for the word of theLord.”
6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go to battle against Raʹmoth-gilʹead, or shall I forbear?” And they said, “Go up; for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.”
7 But Jehoshʹaphat said, “Is there not here another prophet of theLordof whom we may inquire?”
8 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshʹaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of theLord, Micaiʹah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil.” And Jehoshʹaphat said, “Let not the king say so.”
9 Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiʹah the son of Imlah.”
10 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshʹaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samarʹia; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
11 And Zedekiʹah the son of Chenaʹanah made for himself horns of iron, and said, “Thus says theLord, ‘With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.’ ”
12 And all the prophets prophesied so, and said, “Go up to Raʹmoth-gilʹead and triumph; theLordwill give it into the hand of the king.”
### Micaiah Predicts Failure
13 And the messenger who went to summon Micaiʹah said to him, “Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.”
14 But Micaiʹah said, “As theLordlives, what theLordsays to me, that I will speak.”
15 And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiʹah, shall we go to Raʹmoth-gilʹead to battle, or shall we forbear?” And he answered him, “Go up and triumph; theLordwill give it into the hand of the king.”
16 But the king said to him, “How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of theLord?”
17 And he said, “I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and theLordsaid, ‘These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.’ ”
18 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshʹaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”
19 And Micaiʹah said, “Therefore hear the word of theLord: I saw theLordsitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left;
20 and theLordsaid, ‘Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Raʹmoth-gilʹead?’ And one said one thing, and another said another.
21 Then a spirit came forward and stood before theLord, saying, ‘I will entice him.’
22 And theLordsaid to him, ‘By what means?’ And he said, ‘I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go forth and do so.’
23 Now therefore behold, theLordhas put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; theLordhas spoken evil concerning you.”
24 Then Zedekiʹah the son of Chenaʹanah came near and struck Micaiʹah on the cheek, and said, “How did the Spirit of theLordgo from me to speak to you?”
25 And Micaiʹah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.”
26 And the king of Israel said, “Seize Micaiʹah, and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joʹash the king’s son;
27 and say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with scant fare of bread and water, until I come in peace.” ’ ”
28 And Micaiʹah said, “If you return in peace, theLordhas not spoken by me.” And he said, “Hear, all you peoples!”
### Defeat and Death of Ahab
29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshʹaphat the king of Judah went up to Raʹmoth-gilʹead.
30 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshʹaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.” And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
31 Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, “Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.”
32 And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshʹaphat, they said, “It is surely the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him; and Jehoshʹaphat cried out.
33 And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
34 But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn about, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.”
35 And the battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died; and the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.
36 And about sunset a cry went through the army, “Every man to his city, and every man to his country!”
37 So the king died, and was brought to Samarʹia; and they buried the king in Samarʹia.
38 And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samarʹia, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves in it, according to the word of theLordwhich he had spoken.
39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
40 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziʹah his son reigned in his stead.
### Jehoshaphat Reigns over Judah
41 Jehoshʹaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
42 Jehoshʹaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azuʹbah the daughter of Shilhi.
43 He walked in all the way of Asa his father; he did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of theLord; yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
44 Jehoshʹaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshʹaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
46 And the remnant of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the days of his father Asa, he exterminated from the land.
47 There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.
48 Jehoshʹaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Eʹzion-geʹber.
49 Then Ahaziʹah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshʹaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships,” but Jehoshʹaphat was not willing.
50 And Jehoshʹaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoʹram his son reigned in his stead.
### Ahaziah Reigns over Israel
51 Ahaziʹah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samarʹia in the seventeenth year of Jehoshʹaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.
52 He did what was evil in the sight of theLord, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboʹam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
53 He served Baʹal and worshiped him, and provoked theLord, the God of Israel, to anger in every way that his father had done.


# Liber Regum Tertius, Secundum Hebraeos Primus Malachim 22 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Transierunt igitur tres anni absque bello inter Syriam et Israël.
2 In anno autem tertio, descendit Josaphat rex Juda ad regem Israël.
3 (Dixitque rex Israël ad servos suos: Ignoratis quod nostra sit Ramoth Galaad, et negligimus tollere eam de manu regis Syriæ?)
4 Et ait ad Josaphat: Veniesne mecum ad præliandum in Ramoth Galaad?
5 Dixitque Josaphat ad regem Israël: Sicut ego sum, ita et tu: populus meus et populus tuus unum sunt: et equites mei, equites tui. Dixitque Josaphat ad regem Israël: Quære, oro te, hodie sermonem Domini.
6 Congregavit ergo rex Israël prophetas, quadringentos circiter viros, et ait ad eos: Ire debeo in Ramoth Galaad ad bellandum, an quiescere? Qui responderunt: Ascende, et dabit eam Dominus in manu regis.
7 Dixit autem Josaphat: Non est hic propheta Domini quispiam, ut interrogemus per eum?
8 Et ait rex Israël ad Josaphat: Remansit vir unus per quem possumus interrogare Dominum: sed ego odi eum, quia non prophetat mihi bonum, sed malum: Michæas filius Jemla. Cui Josaphat ait: Ne loquaris ita, rex.
9 Vocavit ergo rex Israël eunuchum quemdam, et dixit ei: Festina adducere Michæam filium Jemla.

10 Rex autem Israël, et Josaphat rex Juda, sedebant unusquisque in solio suo, vestiti cultu regio, in area juxta ostium portæ Samariæ: et universi prophetæ prophetabant in conspectu eorum.
11 Fecit quoque sibi Sedecias filius Chanaana cornua ferrea, et ait: Hæc dicit Dominus: His ventilabis Syriam, donec deleas eam.
12 Omnesque prophetæ similiter prophetabant, dicentes: Ascende in Ramoth Galaad, et vade prospere, et tradet Dominus in manus regis.
13 Nuntius vero qui ierat ut vocaret Michæam, locutus est ad eum, dicens: Ecce sermones prophetarum ore uno regi bona prædicant: sit ergo sermo tuus similis eorum, et loquere bona.
14 Cui Michæas ait: Vivit Dominus, quia quodcumque dixerit mihi Dominus, hoc loquar.

15 Venit itaque ad regem, et ait illi rex: Michæa, ire debemus in Ramoth Galaad ad præliandum, an cessare? Cui ille respondit: Ascende, et vade prospere, et tradet eam Dominus in manus regis.
16 Dixit autem rex ad eum: Iterum atque iterum adjuro te, ut non loquaris mihi nisi quod verum est, in nomine Domini.
17 Et ille ait: Vidi cunctum Israël dispersum in montibus, quasi oves non habentes pastorem. Et ait Dominus: Non habent isti dominum: revertatur unusquisque in domum suam in pace.
18 (Dixit ergo rex Israël ad Josaphat: Numquid non dixi tibi, quia non prophetat mihi bonum, sed semper malum?)
19 Ille vero addens, ait: Propterea audi sermonem Domini: vidi Dominum sedentem super solium suum, et omnem exercitum cæli assistentem ei a dextris et a sinistris:
20 et ait Dominus: Quis decipiet Achab regem Israël, ut ascendat, et cadat in Ramoth Galaad? Et dixit unus verba hujuscemodi, et alius aliter.
21 Egressus est autem spiritus, et stetit coram Domino, et ait: Ego decipiam illum. Cui locutus est Dominus: In quo?
22 Et ille ait: Egrediar, et ero spiritus mendax in ore omnium prophetarum ejus. Et dixit Dominus: Decipies, et prævalebis: egredere, et fac ita.
23 Nunc igitur ecce dedit Dominus spiritum mendacii in ore omnium prophetarum tuorum, qui hic sunt, et Dominus locutus est contra te malum.

24 Accessit autem Sedecias filius Chanaana, et percussit Michæam in maxillam, et dixit: Mene ergo dimisit spiritus Domini, et locutus est tibi?
25 Et ait Michæas: Visurus es in die illa quando ingredieris cubiculum intra cubiculum ut abscondaris.
26 Et ait rex Israël: Tollite Michæam, et maneat apud Amon principem civitatis, et apud Joas filium Amelech,
27 et dicite eis: Hæc dicit rex: Mittite virum istum in carcerem, et sustentate eum pane tribulationis, et aqua angustiæ, donec revertar in pace.
28 Dixitque Michæas: Si reversus fueris in pace, non est locutus in me Dominus. Et ait: Audite, populi omnes.

29 Ascendit itaque rex Israël, et Josaphat rex Juda, in Ramoth Galaad.
30 Dixit itaque rex Israël ad Josaphat: Sume arma, et ingredere prælium, et induere vestibus tuis. Porro rex Israël mutavit habitum suum, et ingressus est bellum.
31 Rex autem Syriæ præceperat principibus curruum triginta duobus, dicens: Non pugnabitis contra minorem et majorem quempiam, nisi contra regem Israël solum.
32 Cum ergo vidissent principes curruum Josaphat, suspicati sunt quod ipse esset rex Israël, et impetu facto pugnabant contra eum: et exclamavit Josaphat.
33 Intellexeruntque principes curruum quod non esset rex Israël, et cessaverunt ab eo.
34 Vir autem quidam tetendit arcum, in incertum sagittam dirigens, et casu percussit regem Israël inter pulmonem et stomachum. At ille dixit aurigæ suo: Verte manum tuam, et ejice me de exercitu, quia graviter vulneratus sum.
35 Commissum est ergo prælium in die illa, et rex Israël stabat in curru suo contra Syros, et mortuus est vespere: fluebat autem sanguis plagæ in sinum currus,
36 et præco insonuit in universo exercitu antequam sol occumberet, dicens: Unusquisque revertatur in civitatem, et in terram suam.
37 Mortuus est autem rex, et perlatus est in Samariam: sepelieruntque regem in Samaria,
38 et laverunt currum ejus in piscina Samariæ: et linxerunt canes sanguinem ejus, et habenas laverunt, juxta verbum Domini quod locutus fuerat.

39 Reliqua autem sermonum Achab, et universa quæ fecit, et domus eburnea quam ædificavit, cunctarumque urbium quas exstruxit, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro sermonum dierum regum Israël?
40 Dormivit ergo Achab cum patribus suis, et regnavit Ochozias filius ejus pro eo.

41 Josaphat vero filius Asa regnare cœperat super Judam anno quarto Achab regis Israël.
42 Triginta quinque annorum erat cum regnare cœpisset, et viginti quinque annis regnavit in Jerusalem: nomen matris ejus Azuba filia Salai.
43 Et ambulavit in omni via Asa patris sui, et non declinavit ex ea: fecitque quod rectum erat in conspectu Domini.
44 Verumtamen excelsa non abstulit: adhuc enim populus sacrificabat, et adolebat incensum in excelsis.
45 Pacemque habuit Josaphat cum rege Israël.
46 Reliqua autem verborum Josaphat, et opera ejus quæ gessit, et prælia, nonne hæc scripta sunt in libro verborum dierum regum Juda?
47 Sed et reliquias effeminatorum qui remanserant in diebus Asa patris ejus, abstulit de terra.
48 Nec erat tunc rex constitutus in Edom.
49 Rex vero Josaphat fecerat classes in mari, quæ navigarent in Ophir propter aurum: et ire non potuerunt, quia confractæ sunt in Asiongaber.
50 Tunc ait Ochozias filius Achab ad Josaphat: Vadant servi mei cum servis tuis in navibus. Et noluit Josaphat.
51 Dormivitque Josaphat cum patribus suis, et sepultus est cum eis in civitate David patris sui: regnavitque Joram filius ejus pro eo.

52 Ochozias autem filius Achab regnare cœperat super Israël in Samaria, anno septimodecimo Josaphat regis Juda: regnavitque super Israël duobus annis.
53 Et fecit malum in conspectu Domini, et ambulavit in via patris sui et matris suæ, et in via Jeroboam filii Nabat, qui peccare fecit Israël.
54 Servivit quoque Baal, et adoravit eum, et irritavit Dominum Deum Israël, juxta omnia quæ fecerat pater ejus.


# Βασιλειῶν Γʹ 22 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐκάθισεν τρία ἔτη καὶ οὐκ ἦν πόλεμος ἀνὰ μέσον Συρίας καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Ισραηλ
2 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ τρίτῳ καὶ κατέβη Ιωσαφατ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα πρὸς βασιλέα Ισραηλ
3 καὶ εἶπεν βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ εἰ οἴδατε ὅτι ἡμῖν Ρεμμαθ Γαλααδ καὶ ἡμεῖς σιωπῶμεν λαβεῖν αὐτὴν ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Συρίας
4 καὶ εἶπεν βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ πρὸς Ιωσαφατ ἀναβήσῃ με{Q'} ἡμῶν εἰς Ρεμμαθ Γαλααδ εἰς πόλεμον καὶ εἶπεν Ιωσαφατ καθὼς ἐγὼ οὕτως καὶ σύ καθὼς ὁ λαός μου ὁ λαός σου καθὼς οἱ ἵπποι μου οἱ ἵπποι σου
5 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωσαφατ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα πρὸς βασιλέα Ισραηλ ἐπερωτήσατε δὴ σήμερον τὸν κύριον
6 καὶ συνήθροισεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ πάντας τοὺς προφήτας ὡς τετρακοσίους ἄνδρας καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς εἰ πορευθῶ εἰς Ρεμμαθ Γαλααδ εἰς πόλεμον ἢ ἐπίσχω καὶ εἶπαν ἀνάβαινε καὶ διδοὺς δώσει κύριος εἰς χεῖρας τοῦ βασιλέως
7 καὶ εἶπεν Ιωσαφατ πρὸς βασιλέα Ισραηλ οὐκ ἔστιν ὧδε προφήτης τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ἐπερωτήσομεν τὸν κύριον δ{I'} αὐτοῦ
8 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ πρὸς Ιωσαφατ ἔτι ἔστιν ἀνὴρ εἷς τοῦ ἐπερωτῆσαι τὸν κύριον δ{I'} αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγὼ μεμίσηκα αὐτόν ὅτι οὐ λαλεῖ περὶ ἐμοῦ καλά ἀλ{L'} ἢ κακά Μιχαιας υἱὸς Ιεμλα καὶ εἶπεν Ιωσαφατ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα μὴ λεγέτω ὁ βασιλεὺς οὕτως
9 καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ εὐνοῦχον ἕνα καὶ εἶπεν τάχος Μιχαιαν υἱὸν Ιεμλα

10 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ Ιωσαφατ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα ἐκάθηντο ἀνὴρ ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ ἔνοπλοι ἐν ταῖς πύλαις Σαμαρείας καὶ πάντες οἱ προφῆται ἐπροφήτευον ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν
11 καὶ ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ Σεδεκιας υἱὸς Χανανα κέρατα σιδηρᾶ καὶ εἶπεν τάδε λέγει κύριος ἐν τούτοις κερατιεῖς τὴν Συρίαν ἕως συντελεσθῇ
12 καὶ πάντες οἱ προφῆται ἐπροφήτευον οὕτως λέγοντες ἀνάβαινε εἰς Ρεμμαθ Γαλααδ καὶ εὐοδώσει καὶ δώσει κύριος εἰς χεῖράς σου καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Συρίας
13 καὶ ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ πορευθεὶς καλέσαι τὸν Μιχαιαν ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ λέγων ἰδοὺ δὴ λαλοῦσιν πάντες οἱ προφῆται ἐν στόματι ἑνὶ καλὰ περὶ τοῦ βασιλέως γίνου δὴ καὶ σὺ εἰς λόγους σου κατὰ τοὺς λόγους ἑνὸς τούτων καὶ λάλησον καλά
14 καὶ εἶπεν Μιχαιας ζῇ κύριος ὅτι ἃ ἂν εἴπῃ κύριος πρός με ταῦτα λαλήσω

15 καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς Μιχαια εἰ ἀναβῶ εἰς Ρεμμαθ Γαλααδ εἰς πόλεμον ἢ ἐπίσχω καὶ εἶπεν ἀνάβαινε καὶ εὐοδώσει καὶ δώσει κύριος εἰς χεῖρα τοῦ βασιλέως
16 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς ποσάκις ἐγὼ ὁρκίζω σε ὅπως λαλήσῃς πρός με ἀλήθειαν ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου
17 καὶ εἶπεν Μιχαιας οὐχ οὕτως ἑώρακα πάντα τὸν Ισραηλ διεσπαρμένον ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν ὡς ποίμνιον ᾧ οὐκ ἔστιν ποιμήν καὶ εἶπεν κύριος οὐ κύριος τούτοις ἀναστρεφέτω ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ἐν εἰρήνῃ
18 καὶ εἶπεν βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ πρὸς Ιωσαφατ βασιλέα Ιουδα οὐκ εἶπα πρὸς σέ οὐ προφητεύει οὗτός μοι καλά διότι ἀλ{L'} ἢ κακά
19 καὶ εἶπεν Μιχαιας οὐχ οὕτως οὐκ ἐγώ ἄκουε ῥῆμα κυρίου οὐχ οὕτως εἶδον τὸν κύριον θεὸν Ισραηλ καθήμενον ἐπὶ θρόνου αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσα ἡ στρατιὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ εἱστήκει περὶ αὐτὸν ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξ εὐωνύμων αὐτοῦ
20 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος τίς ἀπατήσει τὸν Αχααβ βασιλέα Ισραηλ καὶ ἀναβήσεται καὶ πεσεῖται ἐν Ρεμμαθ Γαλααδ καὶ εἶπεν οὗτος οὕτως καὶ οὗτος οὕτως
21 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν πνεῦμα καὶ ἔστη ἐνώπιον κυρίου καὶ εἶπεν ἐγὼ ἀπατήσω αὐτόν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν κύριος ἐν τίνι
22 καὶ εἶπεν ἐξελεύσομαι καὶ ἔσομαι πνεῦμα ψευδὲς ἐν στόματι πάντων τῶν προφητῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν ἀπατήσεις καί γε δυνήσει ἔξελθε καὶ ποίησον οὕτως
23 καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἔδωκεν κύριος πνεῦμα ψευδὲς ἐν στόματι πάντων τῶν προφητῶν σου τούτων καὶ κύριος ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ σὲ κακά

24 καὶ προσῆλθεν Σεδεκιου υἱὸς Χανανα καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὸν Μιχαιαν ἐπὶ τὴν σιαγόνα καὶ εἶπεν ποῖον πνεῦμα κυρίου τὸ λαλῆσαν ἐν σοί
25 καὶ εἶπεν Μιχαιας ἰδοὺ σὺ ὄψῃ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ὅταν εἰσέλθῃς ταμίειον τοῦ ταμιείου τοῦ κρυβῆναι
26 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ λάβετε τὸν Μιχαιαν καὶ ἀποστρέψατε αὐτὸν πρὸς Εμηρ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς πόλεως καὶ τῷ Ιωας υἱῷ τοῦ βασιλέως
27 εἰπὸν θέσθαι τοῦτον ἐν φυλακῇ καὶ ἐσθίειν αὐτὸν ἄρτον θλίψεως καὶ ὕδωρ θλίψεως ἕως τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι με ἐν εἰρήνῃ
28 καὶ εἶπεν Μιχαιας ἐὰν ἐπιστρέφων ἐπιστρέψῃς ἐν εἰρήνῃ οὐκ ἐλάλησεν κύριος ἐν ἐμοί

29 καὶ ἀνέβη βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ Ιωσαφατ βασιλεὺς Ιουδα με{T'} αὐτοῦ εἰς Ρεμμαθ Γαλααδ
30 καὶ εἶπεν βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ πρὸς Ιωσαφατ βασιλέα Ιουδα συγκαλύψομαι καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι εἰς τὸν πόλεμον καὶ σὺ ἔνδυσαι τὸν ἱματισμόν μου καὶ συνεκαλύψατο ὁ βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον
31 καὶ βασιλεὺς Συρίας ἐνετείλατο τοῖς ἄρχουσι τῶν ἁρμάτων αὐτοῦ τριάκοντα καὶ δυσὶν λέγων μὴ πολεμεῖτε μικρὸν καὶ μέγαν ἀλ{L'} ἢ τὸν βασιλέα Ισραηλ μονώτατον
32 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδον οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν ἁρμάτων τὸν Ιωσαφατ βασιλέα Ιουδα καὶ αὐτοὶ εἶπον φαίνεται βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ οὗτος καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν αὐτὸν πολεμῆσαι καὶ ἀνέκραξεν Ιωσαφατ
33 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδον οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν ἁρμάτων ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν βασιλεὺς Ισραηλ οὗτος καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
34 καὶ ἐνέτεινεν εἷς τὸ τόξον εὐστόχως καὶ ἐπάταξεν τὸν βασιλέα Ισραηλ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ πνεύμονος καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ θώρακος καὶ εἶπεν τῷ ἡνιόχῳ αὐτοῦ ἐπίστρεψον τὰς χεῖράς σου καὶ ἐξάγαγέ με ἐκ τοῦ πολέμου ὅτι τέτρωμαι
35 καὶ ἐτροπώθη ὁ πόλεμος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἦν ἑστηκὼς ἐπὶ τοῦ ἅρματος ἐξ ἐναντίας Συρίας ἀπὸ πρωὶ ἕως ἑσπέρας καὶ ἀπέχυννε τὸ αἷμα ἐκ τῆς πληγῆς εἰς τὸν κόλπον τοῦ ἅρματος καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἑσπέρας καὶ ἐξεπορεύετο τὸ αἷμα τῆς τροπῆς ἕως τοῦ κόλπου τοῦ ἅρματος
36 καὶ ἔστη ὁ στρατοκῆρυξ δύνοντος τοῦ ἡλίου λέγων ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ πόλιν καὶ εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γῆν
37 ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ βασιλεύς καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Σαμάρειαν καὶ ἔθαψαν τὸν βασιλέα ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ
38 καὶ ἀπένιψαν τὸ ἅρμα ἐπὶ τὴν κρήνην Σαμαρείας καὶ ἐξέλειξαν αἱ ὕες καὶ οἱ κύνες τὸ αἷμα καὶ αἱ πόρναι ἐλούσαντο ἐν τῷ αἵματι κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα κυρίου ὃ ἐλάλησεν

39 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Αχααβ καὶ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησεν καὶ οἶκον ἐλεφάντινον ὃν ᾠκοδόμησεν καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις ἃς ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γέγραπται ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τῶν βασιλέων Ισραηλ
40 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Αχααβ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Οχοζιας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ

41 καὶ Ιωσαφατ υἱὸς Ασα ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ Ιουδα ἔτει τετάρτῳ τῷ Αχααβ βασιλέως Ισραηλ ἐβασίλευσεν
42 Ιωσαφατ υἱὸς τριάκοντα καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν καὶ εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Αζουβα θυγάτηρ Σελεϊ
43 καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν πάσῃ ὁδῷ Ασα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐξέκλινεν ἀ{P'} αὐτῆς τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς κυρίου
44 πλὴν τῶν ὑψηλῶν οὐκ ἐξῆρεν ἔτι ὁ λαὸς ἐθυσίαζεν καὶ ἐθυμίων ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς
45 καὶ εἰρήνευσεν Ιωσαφατ μετὰ βασιλέως Ισραηλ
46 καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ιωσαφατ καὶ αἱ δυναστεῖαι αὐτοῦ ὅσα ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τῶν βασιλέων Ιουδα

51 καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ιωσαφατ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐτάφη παρὰ τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυιδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ιωραμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ

52 καὶ Οχοζιας υἱὸς Αχααβ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ Ισραηλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἐν ἔτει ἑπτακαιδεκάτῳ Ιωσαφατ βασιλεῖ Ιουδα καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ισραηλ ἔτη δύο
53 καὶ ἐποίησεν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον κυρίου καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ Αχααβ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν ὁδῷ Ιεζαβελ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις οἴκου Ιεροβοαμ υἱοῦ Ναβατ ὃς ἐξήμαρτεν τὸν Ισραηλ
54 καὶ ἐδούλευσεν τοῖς Βααλιμ καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτοῖς καὶ παρώργισεν τὸν κύριον θεὸν Ισραηλ κατὰ πάντα τὰ γενόμενα ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ
