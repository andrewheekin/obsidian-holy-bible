# Book of Psalms 116 (RSVCE)

### Thanksgiving for Recovery from Illness
1 I love theLord, because he has heard my voice and my supplications.
2 Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.
3 The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish.
4 Then I called on the name of theLord: “OLord, I beseech thee, save my life!”
5 Gracious is theLord, and righteous; our God is merciful.
6 TheLordpreserves the simple; when I was brought low, he saved me.
7 Return, O my soul, to your rest; for theLordhas dealt bountifully with you.
8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling;
9 I walk before theLord in the land of the living.
10 I kept my faith, even when I said, “I am greatly afflicted”;
11 I said in my consternation, “Men are all a vain hope.”
12 What shall I render to theLord for all his bounty to me?
13 I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of theLord,
14 I will pay my vows to theLord in the presence of all his people.
15 Precious in the sight of theLord is the death of his saints.
16 OLord, I am thy servant; I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid. Thou hast loosed my bonds.
17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of theLord.
18 I will pay my vows to theLord in the presence of all his people,
19 in the courts of the house of theLord, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise theLord!
