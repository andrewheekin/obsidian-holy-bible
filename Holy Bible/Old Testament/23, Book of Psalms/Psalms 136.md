# Liber Psalmorum 136 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Super flumina Babylonis illic sedimus et flevimus,cum recordaremur Sion.
2 In salicibus in medio ejussuspendimus organa nostra:
3 quia illic interrogaverunt nos, qui captivos duxerunt nos,verba cantionum;et qui abduxerunt nos:Hymnum cantate nobis de canticis Sion.
4 Quomodo cantabimus canticum Dominiin terra aliena?
5 Si oblitus fuero tui, Jerusalem,oblivioni detur dextera mea.
6 Adhæreat lingua mea faucibus meis,si non meminero tui;si non proposuero Jerusalemin principio lætitiæ meæ.
7 Memor esto, Domine, filiorum Edom,in die Jerusalem:qui dicunt: Exinanite, exinaniteusque ad fundamentum in ea.
8 Filia Babylonis misera! beatus qui retribuet tibiretributionem tuam quam retribuisti nobis.
9 Beatus qui tenebit,et allidet parvulos tuos ad petram.


# Ψαλμοί 136 (Septuagint)

1 τῷ Δαυιδ ἐπὶ τῶν ποταμῶν Βαβυλῶνος ἐκεῖ ἐκαθίσαμεν καὶ ἐκλαύσαμεν ἐν τῷ μνησθῆναι ἡμᾶς τῆς Σιων
2 ἐπὶ ταῖς ἰτέαις ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς ἐκρεμάσαμεν τὰ ὄργανα ἡμῶν
3 ὅτι ἐκεῖ ἐπηρώτησαν ἡμᾶς οἱ αἰχμαλωτεύσαντες ἡμᾶς λόγους ᾠδῶν καὶ οἱ ἀπαγαγόντες ἡμᾶς ὕμνον ᾄσατε ἡμῖν ἐκ τῶν ᾠδῶν Σιων
4 πῶς ᾄσωμεν τὴν ᾠδὴν κυρίου ἐπὶ γῆς ἀλλοτρίας
5 ἐὰν ἐπιλάθωμαί σου Ιερουσαλημ ἐπιλησθείη ἡ δεξιά μου
6 κολληθείη ἡ γλῶσσά μου τῷ λάρυγγί μου ἐὰν μή σου μνησθῶ ἐὰν μὴ προανατάξωμαι τὴν Ιερουσαλημ ἐν ἀρχῇ τῆς εὐφροσύνης μου
7 μνήσθητι κύριε τῶν υἱῶν Εδωμ τὴν ἡμέραν Ιερουσαλημ τῶν λεγόντων ἐκκενοῦτε ἐκκενοῦτε ἕως ὁ θεμέλιος ἐν αὐτῇ
8 θυγάτηρ Βαβυλῶνος ἡ ταλαίπωρος μακάριος ὃς ἀνταποδώσει σοι τὸ ἀνταπόδομά σου ὃ ἀνταπέδωκας ἡμῖν
9 μακάριος ὃς κρατήσει καὶ ἐδαφιεῖ τὰ νήπιά σου πρὸς τὴν πέτραν
