# Book of Psalms 149 (RSVCE)

### Praise for God’s Goodness to Israel
1 Praise theLord! Sing to theLorda new song, his praise in the assembly of the faithful!
2 Let Israel be glad in his Maker, let the sons of Zion rejoice in their King!
3 Let them praise his name with dancing, making melody to him with timbrel and lyre!
4 For theLordtakes pleasure in his people; he adorns the humble with victory.
5 Let the faithful exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their couches.
6 Let the high praises of God be in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands,
7 to wreak vengeance on the nations and chastisement on the peoples,
8 to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron,
9 to execute on them the judgment written! This is glory for all his faithful ones. Praise theLord!


# Liber Psalmorum 149 (Latin Vulgate)

 Alleluja.

1 Cantate Domino canticum novum;laus ejus in ecclesia sanctorum.
2 Lætetur Israël in eo qui fecit eum,et filii Sion exsultent in rege suo.
3 Laudent nomen ejus in choro;in tympano et psalterio psallant ei.
4 Quia beneplacitum est Domino in populo suo,et exaltabit mansuetos in salutem.
5 Exsultabunt sancti in gloria;lætabuntur in cubilibus suis.
6 Exaltationes Dei in gutture eorum,et gladii ancipites in manibus eorum:
7 ad faciendam vindictam in nationibus,increpationes in populis;
8 ad alligandos reges eorum in compedibus,et nobiles eorum in manicis ferreis;
9 ut faciant in eis judicium conscriptum:gloria hæc est omnibus sanctis ejus.Alleluja.


# Ψαλμοί 149 (Septuagint)

1 αλληλουια ᾄσατε τῷ κυρίῳ ᾆσμα καινόν ἡ αἴνεσις αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ ὁσίων
2 εὐφρανθήτω Ισραηλ ἐπὶ τῷ ποιήσαντι αὐτόν καὶ υἱοὶ Σιων ἀγαλλιάσθωσαν ἐπὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῶν
3 αἰνεσάτωσαν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐν χορῷ ἐν τυμπάνῳ καὶ ψαλτηρίῳ ψαλάτωσαν αὐτῷ
4 ὅτι εὐδοκεῖ κύριος ἐν λαῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ ὑψώσει πραεῖς ἐν σωτηρίᾳ
5 καυχήσονται ὅσιοι ἐν δόξῃ καὶ ἀγαλλιάσονται ἐπὶ τῶν κοιτῶν αὐτῶν
6 αἱ ὑψώσεις τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν τῷ λάρυγγι αὐτῶν καὶ ῥομφαῖαι δίστομοι ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν
7 τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐλεγμοὺς ἐν τοῖς λαοῖς
8 τοῦ δῆσαι τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν ἐν πέδαις καὶ τοὺς ἐνδόξους αὐτῶν ἐν χειροπέδαις σιδηραῖς
9 τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἐν αὐτοῖς κρίμα ἔγγραπτον δόξα αὕτη ἐστὶν πᾶσι τοῖς ὁσίοις αὐτοῦ
