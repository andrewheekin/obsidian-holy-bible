# Book of Psalms 25 (RSVCE)

### Prayer for Guidance and for Deliverance
1 To thee, OLord, I lift up my soul.
2 O my God, in thee I trust, let me not be put to shame; let not my enemies exult over me.
3 Yea, let none that wait for thee be put to shame; let them be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous.
4 Make me to know thy ways, OLord; teach me thy paths.
5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me, for thou art the God of my salvation; for thee I wait all the day long.
6 Be mindful of thy mercy, OLord, and of thy steadfast love, for they have been from of old.
7 Remember not the sins of my youth, or my trangressions; according to thy steadfast love remember me, for thy goodness’ sake, OLord!
8 Good and upright is theLord; therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
9 He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way.
10 All the paths of theLordare steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
11 For thy name’s sake, OLord, pardon my guilt, for it is great.
12 Who is the man that fears theLord? Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose.
13 He himself shall abide in prosperity, and his children shall possess the land.
14 The friendship of theLordis for those who fear him, and he makes known to them his covenant.
15 My eyes are ever toward theLord, for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
16 Turn thou to me, and be gracious to me; for I am lonely and afflicted.
17 Relieve the troubles of my heart, and bring mecout of my distresses.
18 Consider my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins.
19 Consider how many are my foes, and with what violent hatred they hate me.
20 Oh guard my life, and deliver me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee.
21 May integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for thee.
22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.


# Liber Psalmorum 25 (Latin Vulgate)

 In finem. Psalmus David.

1 Judica me, Domine, quoniam ego in innocentia mea ingressus sum,et in Domino sperans non infirmabor.
2 Proba me, Domine, et tenta me;ure renes meos et cor meum.
3 Quoniam misericordia tua ante oculos meos est,et complacui in veritate tua.
4 Non sedi cum concilio vanitatis,et cum iniqua gerentibus non introibo.
5 Odivi ecclesiam malignantium,et cum impiis non sedebo.
6 Lavabo inter innocentes manus meas,et circumdabo altare tuum, Domine:
7 ut audiam vocem laudis,et enarrem universa mirabilia tua.
8 Domine, dilexi decorem domus tuæ,et locum habitationis gloriæ tuæ.
9 Ne perdas cum impiis, Deus, animam meam,et cum viris sanguinum vitam meam:
10 in quorum manibus iniquitates sunt;dextera eorum repleta est muneribus.
11 Ego autem in innocentia mea ingressus sum;redime me, et miserere mei.
12 Pes meus stetit in directo;in ecclesiis benedicam te, Domine.


# Ψαλμοί 25 (Septuagint)

1 τοῦ Δαυιδ κρῖνόν με κύριε ὅτι ἐγὼ ἐν ἀκακίᾳ μου ἐπορεύθην καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ κυρίῳ ἐλπίζων οὐ μὴ ἀσθενήσω
2 δοκίμασόν με κύριε καὶ πείρασόν με πύρωσον τοὺς νεφρούς μου καὶ τὴν καρδίαν μου
3 ὅτι τὸ ἔλεός σου κατέναντι τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μού ἐστιν καὶ εὐηρέστησα ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ σου
4 οὐκ ἐκάθισα μετὰ συνεδρίου ματαιότητος καὶ μετὰ παρανομούντων οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθω
5 ἐμίσησα ἐκκλησίαν πονηρευομένων καὶ μετὰ ἀσεβῶν οὐ μὴ καθίσω
6 νίψομαι ἐν ἀθῴοις τὰς χεῖράς μου καὶ κυκλώσω τὸ θυσιαστήριόν σου κύριε
7 τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι φωνὴν αἰνέσεως καὶ διηγήσασθαι πάντα τὰ θαυμάσιά σου
8 κύριε ἠγάπησα εὐπρέπειαν οἴκου σου καὶ τόπον σκηνώματος δόξης σου
9 μὴ συναπολέσῃς μετὰ ἀσεβῶν τὴν ψυχήν μου καὶ μετὰ ἀνδρῶν αἱμάτων τὴν ζωήν μου
10 ὧν ἐν χερσὶν ἀνομίαι ἡ δεξιὰ αὐτῶν ἐπλήσθη δώρων
11 ἐγὼ δὲ ἐν ἀκακίᾳ μου ἐπορεύθην λύτρωσαί με καὶ ἐλέησόν με
12 ὁ γὰρ πούς μου ἔστη ἐν εὐθύτητι ἐν ἐκκλησίαις εὐλογήσω σε κύριε
