# Book of Psalms 19 (RSVCE)

### God’s Glory in Creation and the Law
1 The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
2 Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night declares knowledge.
3 There is no speech, nor are there words; their voice is not heard;
4 yet their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,
5 which comes forth like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and like a strong man runs its course with joy.
6 Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them; and there is nothing hid from its heat.
7 The law of theLordis perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of theLordis sure, making wise the simple;
8 the precepts of theLordare right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of theLordis pure, enlightening the eyes;
9 the fear of theLordis clean, enduring for ever; the ordinances of theLordare true, and righteous altogether.
10 More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.
11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.
12 But who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults.
13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression.
14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, OLord, my rock and my redeemer.


# Liber Psalmorum 19 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In finem. Psalmus David.

2 Exaudiat te Dominus in die tribulationis;protegat te nomen Dei Jacob.
3 Mittat tibi auxilium de sancto,et de Sion tueatur te.
4 Memor sit omnis sacrificii tui,et holocaustum tuum pingue fiat.
5 Tribuat tibi secundum cor tuum,et omne consilium tuum confirmet.
6 Lætabimur in salutari tuo;et in nomine Dei nostri magnificabimur.
7 Impleat Dominus omnes petitiones tuas;nunc cognovi quoniam salvum fecit Dominus christum suum.Exaudiet illum de cælo sancto suo,in potentatibus salus dexteræ ejus.
8 Hi in curribus, et hi in equis;nos autem in nomine Domini Dei nostri invocabimus.
9 Ipsi obligati sunt, et ceciderunt;nos autem surreximus, et erecti sumus.
10 Domine, salvum fac regem,et exaudi nos in die qua invocaverimus te.


# Ψαλμοί 19 (Septuagint)

1 εἰς τὸ τέλος ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυιδ

2 ἐπακούσαι σου κύριος ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλίψεως ὑπερασπίσαι σου τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ θεοῦ Ιακωβ
3 ἐξαποστείλαι σοι βοήθειαν ἐξ ἁγίου καὶ ἐκ Σιων ἀντιλάβοιτό σου
4 μνησθείη πάσης θυσίας σου καὶ τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμά σου πιανάτω διάψαλμα
5 δῴη σοι κατὰ τὴν καρδίαν σου καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν βουλήν σου πληρώσαι
6 ἀγαλλιασόμεθα ἐν τῷ σωτηρίῳ σου καὶ ἐν ὀνόματι θεοῦ ἡμῶν μεγαλυνθησόμεθα πληρώσαι κύριος πάντα τὰ αἰτήματά σου
7 νῦν ἔγνων ὅτι ἔσωσεν κύριος τὸν χριστὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπακούσεται αὐτοῦ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἁγίου αὐτοῦ ἐν δυναστείαις ἡ σωτηρία τῆς δεξιᾶς αὐτοῦ
8 οὗτοι ἐν ἅρμασιν καὶ οὗτοι ἐν ἵπποις ἡμεῖς δὲ ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου θεοῦ ἡμῶν μεγαλυνθησόμεθα
9 αὐτοὶ συνεποδίσθησαν καὶ ἔπεσαν ἡμεῖς δὲ ἀνέστημεν καὶ ἀνωρθώθημεν
10 κύριε σῶσον τὸν βασιλέα σου καὶ ἐπάκουσον ἡμῶν ἐν ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἐπικαλεσώμεθά σε
