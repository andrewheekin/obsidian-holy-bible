# Book of Psalms 10 (RSVCE)

### Prayer for Deliverance from Enemies
1 Why dost thou stand afar off, OLord? Why dost thou hide thyself in times of trouble?
2 In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor; let them be caught in the schemes which they have devised.
3 For the wicked boasts of the desires of his heart, and the man greedy for gain curses and renounces theLord.
4 In the pride of his countenance the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are, “There is no God.”
5 His ways prosper at all times; thy judgments are on high, out of his sight; as for all his foes, he puffs at them.
6 He thinks in his heart, “I shall not be moved; throughout all generations I shall not meet adversity.”
7 His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.
8 He sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he murders the innocent. His eyes stealthily watch for the hapless,
9 he lurks in secret like a lion in his covert; he lurks that he may seize the poor, he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net.
10 The hapless is crushed, sinks down, and falls by his might.
11 He thinks in his heart, “God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he will never see it.”
12 Arise, OLord; O God, lift up thy hand; forget not the afflicted.
13 Why does the wicked renounce God, and say in his heart, “Thou wilt not call to account”?
14 Thou dost see; yea, thou dost note trouble and vexation, that thou mayst take it into thy hands; the hapless commits himself to thee; thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.
15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and evildoer; seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
16 TheLordis king for ever and ever; the nations shall perish from his land.
17 OLord, thou wilt hear the desire of the meek; thou wilt strengthen their heart, thou wilt incline thy ear
18 to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.


# Liber Psalmorum 10 (Latin Vulgate)

 In finem. Psalmus David.

2 In Domino confido; quomodo dicitis animæ meæ:Transmigra in montem sicut passer?
3 Quoniam ecce peccatores intenderunt arcum;paraverunt sagittas suas in pharetra,ut sagittent in obscuro rectos corde:
4 quoniam quæ perfecisti destruxerunt;justus autem, quid fecit?

5 Dominus in templo sancto suo;Dominus in cælo sedes ejus.Oculi ejus in pauperem respiciunt;palpebræ ejus interrogant filios hominum.
6 Dominus interrogat justum et impium;qui autem diligit iniquitatem, odit animam suam.
7 Pluet super peccatores laqueos;ignis et sulphur, et spiritus procellarum, pars calicis eorum.
8 Quoniam justus Dominus, et justitias dilexit:æquitatem vidit vultus ejus.


# Ψαλμοί 10 (Septuagint)

 εἰς τὸ τέλος ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυιδ

2 ἐπὶ τῷ κυρίῳ πέποιθα πᾶς ἐρεῖτε τῇ ψυχῇ μου μεταναστεύου ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη ὡς στρουθίον
3 ὅτι ἰδοὺ οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἐνέτειναν τόξον ἡτοίμασαν βέλη εἰς φαρέτραν τοῦ κατατοξεῦσαι ἐν σκοτομήνῃ τοὺς εὐθεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ
4 ὅτι ἃ κατηρτίσω καθεῖλον ὁ δὲ δίκαιος τί ἐποίησεν

5 κύριος ἐν ναῷ ἁγίῳ αὐτοῦ κύριος ἐν οὐρανῷ ὁ θρόνος αὐτοῦ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν πένητα ἀποβλέπουσιν τὰ βλέφαρα αὐτοῦ ἐξετάζει τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν ἀνθρώπων
6 κύριος ἐξετάζει τὸν δίκαιον καὶ τὸν ἀσεβῆ ὁ δὲ ἀγαπῶν ἀδικίαν μισεῖ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ψυχήν
7 ἐπιβρέξει ἐπὶ ἁμαρτωλοὺς παγίδας πῦρ καὶ θεῖον καὶ πνεῦμα καταιγίδος ἡ μερὶς τοῦ ποτηρίου αὐτῶν
8 ὅτι δίκαιος κύριος καὶ δικαιοσύνας ἠγάπησεν εὐθύτητα εἶδεν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ
