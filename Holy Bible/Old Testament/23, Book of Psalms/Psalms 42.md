# Book of Psalms 42 (RSVCE)

### Longing for God and His Help in Distress
1 As a hart longs for flowing streams, so longs my soul for thee, O God.
2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?
3 My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me continually, “Where is your God?”
4 These things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I went with the throng, and led them in procession to the house of God, with glad shouts and songs of thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.
5 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help
6 and my God. My soul is cast down within me, therefore I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
7 Deep calls to deep at the thunder of thy cataracts; all thy waves and thy billows have gone over me.
8 By day theLordcommands his steadfast love; and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.
9 I say to God, my rock: “Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”
10 As with a deadly wound in my body, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me continually, “Where is your God?”
11 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my help and my God.


# Liber Psalmorum 42 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Judica me, Deus, et discerne causam meam de gente non sancta:ab homine iniquo et doloso erue me.
2 Quia tu es, Deus, fortitudo mea: quare me repulisti?et quare tristis incedo, dum affligit me inimicus?
3 Emitte lucem tuam et veritatem tuam:ipsa me deduxerunt, et adduxeruntin montem sanctum tuum, et in tabernacula tua.
4 Et introibo ad altare Dei,ad Deum qui lætificat juventutem meam.
5 Confitebor tibi in cithara, Deus, Deus meus.Quare tristis es, anima mea?et quare conturbas me?


# Ψαλμοί 42 (Septuagint)

1 ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυιδ κρῖνόν με ὁ θεός καὶ δίκασον τὴν δίκην μου ἐξ ἔθνους οὐχ ὁσίου ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἀδίκου καὶ δολίου ῥῦσαί με
2 ὅτι σὺ εἶ ὁ θεός κραταίωμά μου ἵνα τί ἀπώσω με καὶ ἵνα τί σκυθρωπάζων πορεύομαι ἐν τῷ ἐκθλίβειν τὸν ἐχθρόν μου
3 ἐξαπόστειλον τὸ φῶς σου καὶ τὴν ἀλήθειάν σου αὐτά με ὡδήγησαν καὶ ἤγαγόν με εἰς ὄρος ἅγιόν σου καὶ εἰς τὰ σκηνώματά σου
4 καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ θεοῦ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν τὸν εὐφραίνοντα τὴν νεότητά μου ἐξομολογήσομαί σοι ἐν κιθάρᾳ ὁ θεὸς ὁ θεός μου
5 ἵνα τί περίλυπος εἶ ψυχή καὶ ἵνα τί συνταράσσεις με
