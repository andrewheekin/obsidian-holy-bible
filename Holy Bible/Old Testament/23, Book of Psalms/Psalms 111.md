# Book of Psalms 111 (RSVCE)

### Praise for God’s Wonderful Works
1 Praise theLord! I will give thanks to theLordwith my whole heart, in the company of the upright, in the congregation.
2 Great are the works of theLord, studied by all who have pleasure in them.
3 Full of honor and majesty is his work, and his righteousness endures for ever.
4 He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered; theLordis gracious and merciful.
5 He provides food for those who fear him; he is ever mindful of his covenant.
6 He has shown his people the power of his works, in giving them the heritage of the nations.
7 The works of his hands are faithful and just; all his precepts are trustworthy,
8 they are established for ever and ever, to be performed with faithfulness and uprightness.
9 He sent redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant for ever. Holy and terrible is his name!
10 The fear of theLordis the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all those who practice it. His praise endures for ever!


# Liber Psalmorum 111 (Latin Vulgate)

 Alleluja, reversionis Aggæi et Zachariæ.

1 Beatus vir qui timet Dominum:in mandatis ejus volet nimis.
2 Potens in terra erit semen ejus;generatio rectorum benedicetur.
3 Gloria et divitiæ in domo ejus,et justitia ejus manet in sæculum sæculi.
4 Exortum est in tenebris lumen rectis:misericors, et miserator, et justus.
5 Jucundus homo qui miseretur et commodat;disponet sermones suos in judicio:
6 quia in æternum non commovebitur.
7 In memoria æterna erit justus;ab auditione mala non timebit.Paratum cor ejus sperare in Domino,
8 confirmatum est cor ejus;non commovebitur donec despiciat inimicos suos.
9 Dispersit, dedit pauperibus;justitia ejus manet in sæculum sæculi:cornu ejus exaltabitur in gloria.
10 Peccator videbit, et irascetur;dentibus suis fremet et tabescet:desiderium peccatorum peribit.


# Ψαλμοί 111 (Septuagint)

1 αλληλουια μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὁ φοβούμενος τὸν κύριον ἐν ταῖς ἐντολαῖς αὐτοῦ θελήσει σφόδρα
2 δυνατὸν ἐν τῇ γῇ ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ γενεὰ εὐθείων εὐλογηθήσεται
3 δόξα καὶ πλοῦτος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη αὐτοῦ μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος
4 ἐξανέτειλεν ἐν σκότει φῶς τοῖς εὐθέσιν ἐλεήμων καὶ οἰκτίρμων καὶ δίκαιος
5 χρηστὸς ἀνὴρ ὁ οἰκτίρων καὶ κιχρῶν οἰκονομήσει τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ ἐν κρίσει
6 ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα οὐ σαλευθήσεται εἰς μνημόσυνον αἰώνιον ἔσται δίκαιος
7 ἀπὸ ἀκοῆς πονηρᾶς οὐ φοβηθήσεται ἑτοίμη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ ἐλπίζειν ἐπὶ κύριον
8 ἐστήρικται ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ φοβηθῇ ἕως οὗ ἐπίδῃ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ
9 ἐσκόρπισεν ἔδωκεν τοῖς πένησιν ἡ δικαιοσύνη αὐτοῦ μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος τὸ κέρας αὐτοῦ ὑψωθήσεται ἐν δόξῃ
10 ἁμαρτωλὸς ὄψεται καὶ ὀργισθήσεται τοὺς ὀδόντας αὐτοῦ βρύξει καὶ τακήσεται ἐπιθυμία ἁμαρτωλῶν ἀπολεῖται
