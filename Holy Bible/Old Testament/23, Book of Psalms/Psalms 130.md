# Book of Psalms 130 (RSVCE)

### Waiting for Divine Redemption
1 Out of the depths I cry to thee, OLord!
2 Lord, hear my voice! Let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications!
3 If thou, OLord, shouldst mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?
4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
5 I wait for theLord, my soul waits, and in his word I hope;
6 my soul waits for theLord more than watchmen for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning.
7 O Israel, hope in theLord! For with theLordthere is steadfast love, and with him is plenteous redemption.
8 And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.


# Liber Psalmorum 130 (Latin Vulgate)

 Canticum graduum David.

1 Domine, non est exaltatum cor meum,neque elati sunt oculi mei,neque ambulavi in magnis,neque in mirabilibus super me.
2 Si non humiliter sentiebam,sed exaltavi animam meam:sicut ablactatus est super matre sua,ita retributio in anima mea.
3 Speret Israël in Domino,ex hoc nunc et usque in sæculum.


# Ψαλμοί 130 (Septuagint)

1 ᾠδὴ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν τῷ Δαυιδ κύριε οὐχ ὑψώθη μου ἡ καρδία οὐδὲ ἐμετεωρίσθησαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου οὐδὲ ἐπορεύθην ἐν μεγάλοις οὐδὲ ἐν θαυμασίοις ὑπὲρ ἐμέ
2 εἰ μὴ ἐταπεινοφρόνουν ἀλλὰ ὕψωσα τὴν ψυχήν μου ὡς τὸ ἀπογεγαλακτισμένον ἐπὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ ὡς ἀνταπόδοσις ἐπὶ τὴν ψυχήν μου
3 ἐλπισάτω Ισραηλ ἐπὶ τὸν κύριον ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος
