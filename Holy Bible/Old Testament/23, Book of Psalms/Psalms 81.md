# Book of Psalms 81 (RSVCE)

### God’s Appeal to Stubborn Israel
1 Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob!
2 Raise a song, sound the timbrel, the sweet lyre with the harp.
3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.
4 For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
5 He made it a decree in Joseph, when he went out overothe land of Egypt. I hear a voice I had not known:
6 “I relieved your shoulder of the burden; yourqhands were freed from the basket.
7 In distress you called, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Merʹibah.Selah
8 Hear, O my people, while I admonish you! O Israel, if you would but listen to me!
9 There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god.
10 I am theLordyour God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
11 “But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would have none of me.
12 So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels.
13 O that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!
14 I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their foes.
15 Those who hate theLordwould cringe toward him, and their fate would last for ever.
16 I would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”


# Liber Psalmorum 81 (Latin Vulgate)

 Psalmus Asaph.

1 Deus stetit in synagoga deorum;in medio autem deos dijudicat.
2 Usquequo judicatis iniquitatem,et facies peccatorum sumitis?
3 Judicate egeno et pupillo;humilem et pauperem justificate.
4 Eripite pauperem,et egenum de manu peccatoris liberate.
5 Nescierunt, neque intellexerunt;in tenebris ambulant:movebuntur omnia fundamenta terræ.
6 Ego dixi: Dii estis,et filii Excelsi omnes.
7 Vos autem sicut homines moriemini,et sicut unus de principibus cadetis.
8 Surge, Deus, judica terram,quoniam tu hæreditabis in omnibus gentibus.


# Ψαλμοί 81 (Septuagint)

1 ψαλμὸς τῷ Ασαφ ὁ θεὸς ἔστη ἐν συναγωγῇ θεῶν ἐν μέσῳ δὲ θεοὺς διακρίνει
2 ἕως πότε κρίνετε ἀδικίαν καὶ πρόσωπα ἁμαρτωλῶν λαμβάνετε διάψαλμα
3 κρίνατε ὀρφανὸν καὶ πτωχόν ταπεινὸν καὶ πένητα δικαιώσατε
4 ἐξέλεσθε πένητα καὶ πτωχόν ἐκ χειρὸς ἁμαρτωλοῦ ῥύσασθε
5 οὐκ ἔγνωσαν οὐδὲ συνῆκαν ἐν σκότει διαπορεύονται σαλευθήσονται πάντα τὰ θεμέλια τῆς γῆς
6 ἐγὼ εἶπα θεοί ἐστε καὶ υἱοὶ ὑψίστου πάντες
7 ὑμεῖς δὲ ὡς ἄνθρωποι ἀποθνῄσκετε καὶ ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀρχόντων πίπτετε
8 ἀνάστα ὁ θεός κρῖνον τὴν γῆν ὅτι σὺ κατακληρονομήσεις ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν
