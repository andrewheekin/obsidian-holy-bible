# Book of Psalms 112 (RSVCE)

### Blessings of the Righteous
1 Praise theLord! Blessed is the man who fears theLord, who greatly delights in his commandments!
2 His descendants will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.
3 Wealth and riches are in his house; and his righteousness endures for ever.
4 Light rises in the darkness for the upright; theLordkis gracious, merciful, and righteous.
5 It is well with the man who deals generously and lends, who conducts his affairs with justice.
6 For the righteous will never be moved; he will be remembered for ever.
7 He is not afraid of evil tidings; his heart is firm, trusting in theLord.
8 His heart is steady, he will not be afraid, until he sees his desire on his adversaries.
9 He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures for ever; his horn is exalted in honor.
10 The wicked man sees it and is angry; he gnashes his teeth and melts away; the desire of the wicked man comes to nought.


# Liber Psalmorum 112 (Latin Vulgate)

 Alleluja.

1 Laudate, pueri, Dominum;laudate nomen Domini.
2 Sit nomen Domini benedictumex hoc nunc et usque in sæculum.
3 A solis ortu usque ad occasumlaudabile nomen Domini.
4 Excelsus super omnes gentes Dominus,et super cælos gloria ejus.
5 Quis sicut Dominus Deus noster, qui in altis habitat,
6 et humilia respicit in cælo et in terra?
7 Suscitans a terra inopem,et de stercore erigens pauperem:
8 ut collocet eum cum principibus,cum principibus populi sui.
9 Qui habitare facit sterilem in domo,matrem filiorum lætantem.


# Ψαλμοί 112 (Septuagint)

1 αλληλουια αἰνεῖτε παῖδες κύριον αἰνεῖτε τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου
2 εἴη τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου εὐλογημένον ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος
3 ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου μέχρι δυσμῶν αἰνεῖτε τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου
4 ὑψηλὸς ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ὁ κύριος ἐπὶ τοὺς οὐρανοὺς ἡ δόξα αὐτοῦ
5 τίς ὡς κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν ὁ ἐν ὑψηλοῖς κατοικῶν
6 καὶ τὰ ταπεινὰ ἐφορῶν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐν τῇ γῇ
7 ὁ ἐγείρων ἀπὸ γῆς πτωχὸν καὶ ἀπὸ κοπρίας ἀνυψῶν πένητα
8 τοῦ καθίσαι αὐτὸν μετὰ ἀρχόντων μετὰ ἀρχόντων λαοῦ αὐτοῦ
9 ὁ κατοικίζων στεῖραν ἐν οἴκῳ μητέρα τέκνων εὐφραινομένην
