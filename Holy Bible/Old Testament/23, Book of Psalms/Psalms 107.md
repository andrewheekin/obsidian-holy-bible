# Book of Psalms 107 (RSVCE)

### Thanksgiving for Deliverance from Many Troubles
1 O give thanks to theLord, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever!
2 Let the redeemed of theLordsay so, whom he has redeemed from trouble
3 and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
4 Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in;
5 hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.
6 Then they cried to theLordin their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;
7 he led them by a straight way, till they reached a city to dwell in.
8 Let them thank theLordfor his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
9 For he satisfies him who is thirsty, and the hungry he fills with good things.
10 Some sat in darkness and in gloom, prisoners in affliction and in irons,
11 for they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High.
12 Their hearts were bowed down with hard labor; they fell down, with none to help.
13 Then they cried to theLordin their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;
14 he brought them out of darkness and gloom, and broke their bonds asunder.
15 Let them thank theLordfor his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
16 For he shatters the doors of bronze, and cuts in two the bars of iron.
17 Some were sick through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities suffered affliction;
18 they loathed any kind of food, and they drew near to the gates of death.
19 Then they cried to theLordin their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;
20 he sent forth his word, and healed them, and delivered them from destruction.
21 Let them thank theLordfor his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
22 And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!
23 Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters;
24 they saw the deeds of theLord, his wondrous works in the deep.
25 For he commanded, and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea.
26 They mounted up to heaven, they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their evil plight;
27 they reeled and staggered like drunken men, and were at their wits’ end.
28 Then they cried to theLordin their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;
29 he made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
30 Then they were glad because they had quiet, and he brought them to their desired haven.
31 Let them thank theLordfor his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
32 Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
33 He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground,
34 a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.
35 He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water.
36 And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city to live in;
37 they sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get a fruitful yield.
38 By his blessing they multiply greatly; and he does not let their cattle decrease.
39 When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,
40 he pours contempt upon princes and makes them wander in trackless wastes;
41 but he raises up the needy out of affliction, and makes their families like flocks.
42 The upright see it and are glad; and all wickedness stops its mouth.
43 Whoever is wise, let him give heed to these things; let men consider the steadfast love of theLord.


# Liber Psalmorum 107 (Latin Vulgate)

 Canticum Psalmi, ipsi David.

2 Paratum cor meum, Deus, paratum cor meum;cantabo, et psallam in gloria mea.
3 Exsurge, gloria mea; exsurge, psalterium et cithara;exsurgam diluculo.
4 Confitebor tibi in populis, Domine,et psallam tibi in nationibus:
5 quia magna est super cælos misericordia tua,et usque ad nubes veritas tua.
6 Exaltare super cælos, Deus,et super omnem terram gloria tua:
7 ut liberentur dilecti tui.Salvum fac dextera tua, et exaudi me.
8 Deus locutus est in sancto suo:Exsultabo, et dividam Sichimam;et convallem tabernaculorum dimetiar.
9 Meus est Galaad, et meus est Manasses,et Ephraim susceptio capitis mei.Juda rex meus;
10 Moab lebes spei meæ:in Idumæam extendam calceamentum meum;mihi alienigenæ amici facti sunt.
11 Quis deducet me in civitatem munitam?quis deducet me usque in Idumæam?
12 nonne tu, Deus, qui repulisti nos?et non exibis, Deus, in virtutibus nostris?
13 Da nobis auxilium de tribulatione,quia vana salus hominis.
14 In Deo faciemus virtutem;et ipse ad nihilum deducet inimicos nostros.

 ᾠδὴ ψαλμοῦ τῷ Δαυιδ

2 ἑτοίμη ἡ καρδία μου ὁ θεός ἑτοίμη ἡ καρδία μου ᾄσομαι καὶ ψαλῶ ἐν τῇ δόξῃ μου
3 ἐξεγέρθητι ψαλτήριον καὶ κιθάρα ἐξεγερθήσομαι ὄρθρου
4 ἐξομολογήσομαί σοι ἐν λαοῖς κύριε καὶ ψαλῶ σοι ἐν ἔθνεσιν
5 ὅτι μέγα ἐπάνω τῶν οὐρανῶν τὸ ἔλεός σου καὶ ἕως τῶν νεφελῶν ἡ ἀλήθειά σου
6 ὑψώθητι ἐπὶ τοὺς οὐρανούς ὁ θεός καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἡ δόξα σου
7 ὅπως ἂν ῥυσθῶσιν οἱ ἀγαπητοί σου σῶσον τῇ δεξιᾷ σου καὶ ἐπάκουσόν μου
8 ὁ θεὸς ἐλάλησεν ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ αὐτοῦ ὑψωθήσομαι καὶ διαμεριῶ Σικιμα καὶ τὴν κοιλάδα τῶν σκηνῶν διαμετρήσω
9 ἐμός ἐστιν Γαλααδ καὶ ἐμός ἐστιν Μανασση καὶ Εφραιμ ἀντίλημψις τῆς κεφαλῆς μου Ιουδας βασιλεύς μου
10 Μωαβ λέβης τῆς ἐλπίδος μου ἐπὶ τὴν Ιδουμαίαν ἐκτενῶ τὸ ὑπόδημά μου ἐμοὶ ἀλλόφυλοι ὑπετάγησαν
11 τίς ἀπάξει με εἰς πόλιν περιοχῆς τίς ὁδηγήσει με ἕως τῆς Ιδουμαίας
12 οὐχὶ σύ ὁ θεός ὁ ἀπωσάμενος ἡμᾶς καὶ οὐκ ἐξελεύσῃ ὁ θεός ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσιν ἡμῶν
13 δὸς ἡμῖν βοήθειαν ἐκ θλίψεως καὶ ματαία σωτηρία ἀνθρώπου
14 ἐν τῷ θεῷ ποιήσομεν δύναμιν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐξουδενώσει τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἡμῶν
