# Book of Psalms 124 (RSVCE)

### Thanksgiving for Israel’s Deliverance
1 If it had not been theLordwho was on our side, let Israel now say—
2 if it had not been theLordwho was on our side, when men rose up against us,
3 then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us;
4 then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us;
5 then over us would have gone the raging waters.
6 Blessed be theLord, who has not given us as prey to their teeth!
7 We have escaped as a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped!
8 Our help is in the name of theLord, who made heaven and earth.


# Liber Psalmorum 124 (Latin Vulgate)

 Canticum graduum.

1 Qui confidunt in Domino, sicut mons Sion:non commovebitur in æternum,qui habitat
2 in Jerusalem.Montes in circuitu ejus;et Dominus in circuitu populi sui,ex hoc nunc et usque in sæculum.
3 Quia non relinquet Dominus virgam peccatorumsuper sortem justorum:ut non extendant justiad iniquitatem manus suas,
4 benefac, Domine, bonis,et rectis corde.
5 Declinantes autem in obligationes,adducet Dominus cum operantibus iniquitatem.Pax super Israël!


# Ψαλμοί 124 (Septuagint)

1 ᾠδὴ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν οἱ πεποιθότες ἐπὶ κύριον ὡς ὄρος Σιων οὐ σαλευθήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ὁ κατοικῶν Ιερουσαλημ
2 ὄρη κύκλῳ αὐτῆς καὶ κύριος κύκλῳ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος
3 ὅτι οὐκ ἀφήσει τὴν ῥάβδον τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν ἐπὶ τὸν κλῆρον τῶν δικαίων ὅπως ἂν μὴ ἐκτείνωσιν οἱ δίκαιοι ἐν ἀνομίᾳ χεῖρας αὐτῶν
4 ἀγάθυνον κύριε τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς καὶ τοῖς εὐθέσι τῇ καρδίᾳ
5 τοὺς δὲ ἐκκλίνοντας εἰς τὰς στραγγαλιὰς ἀπάξει κύριος μετὰ τῶν ἐργαζομένων τὴν ἀνομίαν εἰρήνη ἐπὶ τὸν Ισραηλ
