# Book of Psalms 66 (RSVCE)

### Praise for God’s Goodness to Israel
1 Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth;
2 sing the glory of his name; give to him glorious praise!
3 Say to God, “How terrible are thy deeds! So great is thy power that thy enemies cringe before thee.
4 All the earth worships thee; they sing praises to thee, sing praises to thy name.”Selah
5 Come and see what God has done: he is terrible in his deeds among men.
6 He turned the sea into dry land; men passed through the river on foot. There did we rejoice in him,
7 who rules by his might for ever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations— let not the rebellious exalt themselves.Selah
8 Bless our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard,
9 who has kept us among the living, and has not let our feet slip.
10 For thou, O God, hast tested us; thou hast tried us as silver is tried.
11 Thou didst bring us into the net; thou didst lay affliction on our loins;
12 thou didst let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet thou hast brought us forth to a spacious place.e
13 I will come into thy house with burnt offerings; I will pay thee my vows,
14 that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.
15 I will offer to thee burnt offerings of fatlings, with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; I will make an offering of bulls and goats.Selah
16 Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for me.
17 I cried aloud to him, and he was extolled with my tongue.
18 If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.
19 But truly God has listened; he has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
20 Blessed be God, because he has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love from me!


# Liber Psalmorum 66 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In finem, in hymnis. Psalmus cantici David.

2 Deus misereatur nostri, et benedicat nobis;illuminet vultum suum super nos, et misereatur nostri:
3 ut cognoscamus in terra viam tuam,in omnibus gentibus salutare tuum.
4 Confiteantur tibi populi, Deus:confiteantur tibi populi omnes.
5 Lætentur et exsultent gentes,quoniam judicas populos in æquitate,et gentes in terra dirigis.
6 Confiteantur tibi populi, Deus:confiteantur tibi populi omnes.
7 Terra dedit fructum suum:benedicat nos Deus, Deus noster!
8 Benedicat nos Deus,et metuant eum omnes fines terræ.


# Ψαλμοί 66 (Septuagint)

1 εἰς τὸ τέλος ἐν ὕμνοις ψαλμὸς ᾠδῆς

2 ὁ θεὸς οἰκτιρήσαι ἡμᾶς καὶ εὐλογήσαι ἡμᾶς ἐπιφάναι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς διάψαλμα
3 τοῦ γνῶναι ἐν τῇ γῇ τὴν ὁδόν σου ἐν πᾶσιν ἔθνεσιν τὸ σωτήριόν σου
4 ἐξομολογησάσθωσάν σοι λαοί ὁ θεός ἐξομολογησάσθωσάν σοι λαοὶ πάντες
5 εὐφρανθήτωσαν καὶ ἀγαλλιάσθωσαν ἔθνη ὅτι κρινεῖς λαοὺς ἐν εὐθύτητι καὶ ἔθνη ἐν τῇ γῇ ὁδηγήσεις διάψαλμα
6 ἐξομολογησάσθωσάν σοι λαοί ὁ θεός ἐξομολογησάσθωσάν σοι λαοὶ πάντες
7 γῆ ἔδωκεν τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῆς εὐλογήσαι ἡμᾶς ὁ θεὸς ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν
8 εὐλογήσαι ἡμᾶς ὁ θεός καὶ φοβηθήτωσαν αὐτὸν πάντα τὰ πέρατα τῆς γῆς
