# Book of Psalms 105 (RSVCE)

### God’s Faithfulness to Israel
1 O give thanks to theLord, call on his name, make known his deeds among the peoples!
2 Sing to him, sing praises to him, tell of all his wonderful works!
3 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek theLordrejoice!
4 Seek theLordand his strength, seek his presence continually!
5 Remember the wonderful works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,
6 O offspring of Abraham his servant, sons of Jacob, his chosen ones!
7 He is theLordour God; his judgments are in all the earth.
8 He is mindful of his covenant for ever, of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
9 the covenant which he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,
10 which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
11 saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance.”
12 When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,
13 wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,
14 he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,
15 saying, “Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!”
16 When he summoned a famine on the land, and broke every staff of bread,
17 he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
18 His feet were hurt with fetters, his neck was put in a collar of iron;
19 until what he had said came to pass the word of theLordtested him.
20 The king sent and released him, the ruler of the peoples set him free;
21 he made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions,
22 to instruct his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.
23 Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
24 And theLordmade his people very fruitful, and made them stronger than their foes.
25 He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.
26 He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.
27 They wrought his signs among them, and miracles in the land of Ham.
28 He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they rebelledxagainst his words.
29 He turned their waters into blood, and caused their fish to die.
30 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.
31 He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
32 He gave them hail for rain, and lightning that flashed through their land.
33 He smote their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.
34 He spoke, and the locusts came, and young locusts without number;
35 which devoured all the vegetation in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.
36 He smote all the first-born in their land, the first issue of all their strength.
37 Then he led forth Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.
38 Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.
39 He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.
40 They asked, and he brought quails, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.
41 He opened the rock, and water gushed forth; it flowed through the desert like a river.
42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
43 So he led forth his people with joy, his chosen ones with singing.
44 And he gave them the lands of the nations; and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples’ toil,
45 to the end that they should keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise theLord!


# Liber Psalmorum 105 (Latin Vulgate)

 Alleluja.

1 Confitemini Domino, quoniam bonus,quoniam in sæculum misericordia ejus.
2 Quis loquetur potentias Domini;auditas faciet omnes laudes ejus?
3 Beati qui custodiunt judicium,et faciunt justitiam in omni tempore.
4 Memento nostri, Domine, in beneplacito populi tui;visita nos in salutari tuo:
5 ad videndum in bonitate electorum tuorum;ad lætandum in lætitia gentis tuæ:ut lauderis cum hæreditate tua.

6 Peccavimus cum patribus nostris:injuste egimus; iniquitatem fecimus.
7 Patres nostri in Ægypto non intellexerunt mirabilia tua;non fuerunt memores multitudinis misericordiæ tuæ.Et irritaverunt ascendentes in mare, mare Rubrum;
8 et salvavit eos propter nomen suum,ut notam faceret potentiam suam.
9 Et increpuit mare Rubrum et exsiccatum est,et deduxit eos in abyssis sicut in deserto.
10 Et salvavit eos de manu odientium,et redemit eos de manu inimici.
11 Et operuit aqua tribulantes eos;unus ex eis non remansit.
12 Et crediderunt verbis ejus,et laudaverunt laudem ejus.
13 Cito fecerunt; obliti sunt operum ejus:et non sustinuerunt consilium ejus.
14 Et concupierunt concupiscentiam in deserto,et tentaverunt Deum in inaquoso.
15 Et dedit eis petitionem ipsorum,et misit saturitatem in animas eorum.
16 Et irritaverunt Moysen in castris;Aaron, sanctum Domini.
17 Aperta est terra, et deglutivit Dathan,et operuit super congregationem Abiron.
18 Et exarsit ignis in synagoga eorum:flamma combussit peccatores.
19 Et fecerunt vitulum in Horeb,et adoraverunt sculptile.
20 Et mutaverunt gloriam suamin similitudinem vituli comedentis fœnum.
21 Obliti sunt Deum qui salvavit eos;qui fecit magnalia in Ægypto,
22 mirabilia in terra Cham,terribilia in mari Rubro.
23 Et dixit ut disperderet eos,si non Moyses, electus ejus,stetisset in confractione in conspectu ejus,ut averteret iram ejus, ne disperderet eos.

24 Et pro nihilo habuerunt terram desiderabilem;non crediderunt verbo ejus.
25 Et murmuraverunt in tabernaculis suis;non exaudierunt vocem Domini.
26 Et elevavit manum suam super eosut prosterneret eos in deserto:
27 et ut dejiceret semen eorum in nationibus,et dispergeret eos in regionibus.
28 Et initiati sunt Beelphegor,et comederunt sacrificia mortuorum.
29 Et irritaverunt eum in adinventionibus suis,et multiplicata est in eis ruina.
30 Et stetit Phinees, et placavit,et cessavit quassatio.
31 Et reputatum est ei in justitiam,in generationem et generationem usque in sempiternum.
32 Et irritaverunt eum ad aquas contradictionis,et vexatus est Moyses propter eos:
33 quia exacerbaverunt spiritum ejus,et distinxit in labiis suis.

34 Non disperdiderunt gentesquas dixit Dominus illis:
35 et commisti sunt inter gentes,et didicerunt opera eorum;
36 et servierunt sculptilibus eorum,et factum est illis in scandalum.
37 Et immolaverunt filios suos et filias suas dæmoniis.
38 Et effuderunt sanguinem innocentem,sanguinem filiorum suorum et filiarum suarum,quas sacrificaverunt sculptilibus Chanaan.Et infecta est terra in sanguinibus,
39 et contaminata est in operibus eorum:et fornicati sunt in adinventionibus suis.
40 Et iratus est furore Dominus in populum suum,et abominatus est hæreditatem suam.
41 Et tradidit eos in manus gentium;et dominati sunt eorum qui oderunt eos.
42 Et tribulaverunt eos inimici eorum,et humiliati sunt sub manibus eorum;
43 sæpe liberavit eos.Ipsi autem exacerbaverunt eum in consilio suo,et humiliati sunt in iniquitatibus suis.
44 Et vidit cum tribularentur,et audivit orationem eorum.
45 Et memor fuit testamenti sui,et pœnituit eum secundum multitudinem misericordiæ suæ:
46 et dedit eos in misericordias,in conspectu omnium qui ceperant eos.

47 Salvos nos fac, Domine Deus noster,et congrega nos de nationibus:ut confiteamur nomini sancto tuo,et gloriemur in laude tua.
48 Benedictus Dominus Deus Israël, a sæculo et usque in sæculum;et dicet omnis populus: Fiat, fiat.


# Ψαλμοί 105 (Septuagint)

1 αλληλουια ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ κυρίῳ ὅτι χρηστός ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ
2 τίς λαλήσει τὰς δυναστείας τοῦ κυρίου ἀκουστὰς ποιήσει πάσας τὰς αἰνέσεις αὐτοῦ
3 μακάριοι οἱ φυλάσσοντες κρίσιν καὶ ποιοῦντες δικαιοσύνην ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ
4 μνήσθητι ἡμῶν κύριε ἐν τῇ εὐδοκίᾳ τοῦ λαοῦ σου ἐπίσκεψαι ἡμᾶς ἐν τῷ σωτηρίῳ σου
5 τοῦ ἰδεῖν ἐν τῇ χρηστότητι τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν σου τοῦ εὐφρανθῆναι ἐν τῇ εὐφροσύνῃ τοῦ ἔθνους σου τοῦ ἐπαινεῖσθαι μετὰ τῆς κληρονομίας σου

6 ἡμάρτομεν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν ἠνομήσαμεν ἠδικήσαμεν
7 οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ οὐ συνῆκαν τὰ θαυμάσιά σου οὐκ ἐμνήσθησαν τοῦ πλήθους τοῦ ἐλέους σου καὶ παρεπίκραναν ἀναβαίνοντες ἐν τῇ ἐρυθρᾷ θαλάσσῃ
8 καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς ἕνεκεν τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ τοῦ γνωρίσαι τὴν δυναστείαν αὐτοῦ
9 καὶ ἐπετίμησεν τῇ ἐρυθρᾷ θαλάσσῃ καὶ ἐξηράνθη καὶ ὡδήγησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἀβύσσῳ ὡς ἐν ἐρήμῳ
10 καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς μισούντων καὶ ἐλυτρώσατο αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθροῦ
11 καὶ ἐκάλυψεν ὕδωρ τοὺς θλίβοντας αὐτούς εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐχ ὑπελείφθη
12 καὶ ἐπίστευσαν ἐν τοῖς λόγοις αὐτοῦ καὶ ᾖσαν τὴν αἴνεσιν αὐτοῦ
13 ἐτάχυναν ἐπελάθοντο τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ οὐχ ὑπέμειναν τὴν βουλὴν αὐτοῦ
14 καὶ ἐπεθύμησαν ἐπιθυμίαν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ καὶ ἐπείρασαν τὸν θεὸν ἐν ἀνύδρῳ
15 καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς τὸ αἴτημα αὐτῶν καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν πλησμονὴν εἰς τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν
16 καὶ παρώργισαν Μωυσῆν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ καὶ Ααρων τὸν ἅγιον κυρίου
17 ἠνοίχθη ἡ γῆ καὶ κατέπιεν Δαθαν καὶ ἐκάλυψεν ἐπὶ τὴν συναγωγὴν Αβιρων
18 καὶ ἐξεκαύθη πῦρ ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ αὐτῶν φλὸξ κατέφλεξεν ἁμαρτωλούς
19 καὶ ἐποίησαν μόσχον ἐν Χωρηβ καὶ προσεκύνησαν τῷ γλυπτῷ
20 καὶ ἠλλάξαντο τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν ἐν ὁμοιώματι μόσχου ἔσθοντος χόρτον
21 ἐπελάθοντο τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ σῴζοντος αὐτούς τοῦ ποιήσαντος μεγάλα ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ
22 θαυμαστὰ ἐν γῇ Χαμ φοβερὰ ἐπὶ θαλάσσης ἐρυθρᾶς
23 καὶ εἶπεν τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι αὐτούς εἰ μὴ Μωυσῆς ὁ ἐκλεκτὸς αὐτοῦ ἔστη ἐν τῇ θραύσει ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι τὴν ὀργὴν αὐτοῦ τοῦ μὴ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι

24 καὶ ἐξουδένωσαν γῆν ἐπιθυμητήν οὐκ ἐπίστευσαν τῷ λόγῳ αὐτοῦ
25 καὶ ἐγόγγυσαν ἐν τοῖς σκηνώμασιν αὐτῶν οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν τῆς φωνῆς κυρίου
26 καὶ ἐπῆρεν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ αὐτοῖς τοῦ καταβαλεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ
27 καὶ τοῦ καταβαλεῖν τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν καὶ διασκορπίσαι αὐτοὺς ἐν ταῖς χώραις
28 καὶ ἐτελέσθησαν τῷ Βεελφεγωρ καὶ ἔφαγον θυσίας νεκρῶν
29 καὶ παρώξυναν αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπληθύνθη ἐν αὐτοῖς ἡ πτῶσις
30 καὶ ἔστη Φινεες καὶ ἐξιλάσατο καὶ ἐκόπασεν ἡ θραῦσις
31 καὶ ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεὰν ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος
32 καὶ παρώργισαν αὐτὸν ἐ{F'} ὕδατος ἀντιλογίας καὶ ἐκακώθη Μωυσῆς δ{I'} αὐτούς
33 ὅτι παρεπίκραναν τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ καὶ διέστειλεν ἐν τοῖς χείλεσιν αὐτοῦ

34 οὐκ ἐξωλέθρευσαν τὰ ἔθνη ἃ εἶπεν κύριος αὐτοῖς
35 καὶ ἐμίγησαν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν καὶ ἔμαθον τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν
36 καὶ ἐδούλευσαν τοῖς γλυπτοῖς αὐτῶν καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτοῖς εἰς σκάνδαλον
37 καὶ ἔθυσαν τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν τοῖς δαιμονίοις
38 καὶ ἐξέχεαν αἷμα ἀθῷον αἷμα υἱῶν αὐτῶν καὶ θυγατέρων ὧν ἔθυσαν τοῖς γλυπτοῖς Χανααν καὶ ἐφονοκτονήθη ἡ γῆ ἐν τοῖς αἵμασιν
39 καὶ ἐμιάνθη ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπόρνευσαν ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν αὐτῶν
40 καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐβδελύξατο τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ
41 καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας ἐθνῶν καὶ ἐκυρίευσαν αὐτῶν οἱ μισοῦντες αὐτούς
42 καὶ ἔθλιψαν αὐτοὺς οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτῶν καὶ ἐταπεινώθησαν ὑπὸ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν
43 πλεονάκις ἐρρύσατο αὐτούς αὐτοὶ δὲ παρεπίκραναν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ βουλῇ αὐτῶν καὶ ἐταπεινώθησαν ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις αὐτῶν
44 καὶ εἶδεν ἐν τῷ θλίβεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ αὐτὸν εἰσακοῦσαι τῆς δεήσεως αὐτῶν
45 καὶ ἐμνήσθη τῆς διαθήκης αὐτοῦ καὶ μετεμελήθη κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ ἐλέους αὐτοῦ
46 καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς οἰκτιρμοὺς ἐναντίον πάντων τῶν αἰχμαλωτισάντων αὐτούς

47 σῶσον ἡμᾶς κύριε ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν καὶ ἐπισυνάγαγε ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν τοῦ ἐξομολογήσασθαι τῷ ὀνόματι τῷ ἁγίῳ σου τοῦ ἐγκαυχᾶσθαι ἐν τῇ αἰνέσει σου
48 εὐλογητὸς κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος καὶ ἐρεῖ πᾶς ὁ λαός γένοιτο γένοιτο
