# Book of Psalms 31 (RSVCE)

### Prayer and Praise for Deliverance from Enemies
1 In thee, OLord, do I seek refuge; let me never be put to shame; in thy righteousness deliver me!
2 Incline thy ear to me, rescue me speedily! Be thou a rock of refuge for me, a strong fortress to save me!
3 Yea, thou art my rock and my fortress; for thy name’s sake lead me and guide me,
4 take me out of the net which is hidden for me, for thou art my refuge.
5 Into thy hand I commit my spirit; thou hast redeemed me, OLord, faithful God.
6 Thou hatest those who pay regard to vain idols; but I trust in theLord.
7 I will rejoice and be glad for thy steadfast love, because thou hast seen my affliction, thou hast taken heed of my adversities,
8 and hast not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; thou hast set my feet in a broad place.
9 Be gracious to me, OLord, for I am in distress; my eye is wasted from grief, my soul and my body also.
10 For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing; my strength fails because of my misery,m and my bones waste away.
11 I am the scorn of all my adversaries, a horrornto my neighbors, an object of dread to my acquaintances; those who see me in the street flee from me.
12 I have passed out of mind like one who is dead; I have become like a broken vessel.
13 Yea, I hear the whispering of many— terror on every side!— as they scheme together against me, as they plot to take my life.
14 But I trust in thee, OLord, I say, “Thou art my God.”
15 My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of my enemies and persecutors!
16 Let thy face shine on thy servant; save me in thy steadfast love!
17 Let me not be put to shame, OLord, for I call on thee; let the wicked be put to shame, let them go dumbfounded to Sheol.
18 Let the lying lips be dumb, which speak insolently against the righteous in pride and contempt.
19 O how abundant is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for those who fear thee, and wrought for those who take refuge in thee, in the sight of the sons of men!
20 In the covert of thy presence thou hidest them from the plots of men; thou holdest them safe under thy shelter from the strife of tongues.
21 Blessed be theLord, for he has wondrously shown his steadfast love to me when I was beset as in a besieged city.
22 I had said in my alarm, “I am driven farofrom thy sight.” But thou didst hear my supplications, when I cried to thee for help.
23 Love theLord, all you his saints! TheLordpreserves the faithful, but abundantly requites him who acts haughtily.
24 Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for theLord!


# Liber Psalmorum 31 (Latin Vulgate)

 Ipsi David intellectus.

1 Beati quorum remissæ sunt iniquitates,et quorum tecta sunt peccata.
2 Beatus vir cui non imputavit Dominus peccatum,nec est in spiritu ejus dolus.
3 Quoniam tacui, inveteraverunt ossa mea,dum clamarem tota die.
4 Quoniam die ac nocte gravata est super me manus tua,conversus sum in ærumna mea, dum configitur spina.
5 Delictum meum cognitum tibi feci,et injustitiam meam non abscondi.Dixi: Confitebor adversum me injustitiam meam Domino;et tu remisisti impietatem peccati mei.
6 Pro hac orabit ad te omnis sanctusin tempore opportuno.Verumtamen in diluvio aquarum multarum,ad eum non approximabunt.
7 Tu es refugium meum a tribulatione quæ circumdedit me;exsultatio mea, erue me a circumdantibus me.

8 Intellectum tibi dabo, et instruam te in via hac qua gradieris;firmabo super te oculos meos.
9 Nolite fieri sicut equus et mulus,quibus non est intellectus.In camo et freno maxillas eorum constringe,qui non approximant ad te.
10 Multa flagella peccatoris;sperantem autem in Domino misericordia circumdabit.
11 Lætamini in Domino, et exsultate, justi;et gloriamini, omnes recti corde.


# Ψαλμοί 31 (Septuagint)

1 τῷ Δαυιδ συνέσεως μακάριοι ὧν ἀφέθησαν αἱ ἀνομίαι καὶ ὧν ἐπεκαλύφθησαν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι
2 μακάριος ἀνήρ οὗ οὐ μὴ λογίσηται κύριος ἁμαρτίαν οὐδὲ ἔστιν ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ δόλος
3 ὅτι ἐσίγησα ἐπαλαιώθη τὰ ὀστᾶ μου ἀπὸ τοῦ κράζειν με ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν
4 ὅτι ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς ἐβαρύνθη ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ ἡ χείρ σου ἐστράφην εἰς ταλαιπωρίαν ἐν τῷ ἐμπαγῆναι ἄκανθαν διάψαλμα
5 τὴν ἁμαρτίαν μου ἐγνώρισα καὶ τὴν ἀνομίαν μου οὐκ ἐκάλυψα εἶπα ἐξαγορεύσω κα{T'} ἐμοῦ τὴν ἀνομίαν μου τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ σὺ ἀφῆκας τὴν ἀσέβειαν τῆς ἁμαρτίας μου διάψαλμα
6 ὑπὲρ ταύτης προσεύξεται πᾶς ὅσιος πρὸς σὲ ἐν καιρῷ εὐθέτῳ πλὴν ἐν κατακλυσμῷ ὑδάτων πολλῶν πρὸς αὐτὸν οὐκ ἐγγιοῦσιν
7 σύ μου εἶ καταφυγὴ ἀπὸ θλίψεως τῆς περιεχούσης με τὸ ἀγαλλίαμά μου λύτρωσαί με ἀπὸ τῶν κυκλωσάντων με διάψαλμα

8 συνετιῶ σε καὶ συμβιβῶ σε ἐν ὁδῷ ταύτῃ ᾗ πορεύσῃ ἐπιστηριῶ ἐπὶ σὲ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου
9 μὴ γίνεσθε ὡς ἵππος καὶ ἡμίονος οἷς οὐκ ἔστιν σύνεσις ἐν χαλινῷ καὶ κημῷ τὰς σιαγόνας αὐτῶν ἄγξαι τῶν μὴ ἐγγιζόντων πρὸς σέ
10 πολλαὶ αἱ μάστιγες τοῦ ἁμαρτωλοῦ τὸν δὲ ἐλπίζοντα ἐπὶ κύριον ἔλεος κυκλώσει
11 εὐφράνθητε ἐπὶ κύριον καὶ ἀγαλλιᾶσθε δίκαιοι καὶ καυχᾶσθε πάντες οἱ εὐθεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ
