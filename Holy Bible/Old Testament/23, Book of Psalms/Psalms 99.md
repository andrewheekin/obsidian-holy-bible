# Book of Psalms 99 (RSVCE)

### Praise to God for His Holiness
1 TheLordreigns; let the peoples tremble! He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake!
2 TheLordis great in Zion; he is exalted over all the peoples.
3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name! Holy is he!
4 Mighty King, lover of justice, thou hast established equity; thou hast executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
5 Extol theLordour God; worship at his footstool! Holy is he!
6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel also was among those who called on his name. They cried to theLord, and he answered them.
7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud; they kept his testimonies, and the statutes that he gave them.
8 OLordour God, thou didst answer them; thou wast a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrongdoings.
9 Extol theLordour God, and worship at his holy mountain; for theLordour God is holy!


# Liber Psalmorum 99 (Latin Vulgate)

 Psalmus in confessione.

2 Jubilate Deo, omnis terra;servite Domino in lætitia.Introite in conspectu ejus in exsultatione.
3 Scitote quoniam Dominus ipse est Deus;ipse fecit nos, et non ipsi nos:populus ejus, et oves pascuæ ejus.
4 Introite portas ejus in confessione;atria ejus in hymnis:confitemini illi.Laudate nomen ejus,
5 quoniam suavis est Dominus,in æternum misericordia ejus,et usque in generationem et generationem veritas ejus.


# Ψαλμοί 99 (Septuagint)

 ψαλμὸς εἰς ἐξομολόγησιν ἀλαλάξατε τῷ κυρίῳ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ

2 δουλεύσατε τῷ κυρίῳ ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ εἰσέλθατε ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει
3 γνῶτε ὅτι κύριος αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ θεός αὐτὸς ἐποίησεν ἡμᾶς καὶ οὐχ ἡμεῖς λαὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ πρόβατα τῆς νομῆς αὐτοῦ
4 εἰσέλθατε εἰς τὰς πύλας αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐξομολογήσει εἰς τὰς αὐλὰς αὐτοῦ ἐν ὕμνοις ἐξομολογεῖσθε αὐτῷ αἰνεῖτε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ
5 ὅτι χρηστὸς κύριος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕως γενεᾶς καὶ γενεᾶς ἡ ἀλήθεια αὐτοῦ
