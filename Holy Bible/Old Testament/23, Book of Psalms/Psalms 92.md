# Book of Psalms 92 (RSVCE)

### Thanksgiving for Vindication
1 It is good to give thanks to theLord, to sing praises to thy name, O Most High;
2 to declare thy steadfast love in the morning, and thy faithfulness by night,
3 to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre.
4 For thou, OLord, hast made me glad by thy work; at the works of thy hands I sing for joy.
5 How great are thy works, OLord! Thy thoughts are very deep!
6 The dull man cannot know, the stupid cannot understand this:
7 that, though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction for ever,
8 but thou, OLord, art on high for ever.
9 For lo, thy enemies, OLord, for lo, thy enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered.
10 But thou hast exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; thou hast poured over melfresh oil.
11 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies, my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.
12 The righteous flourish like the palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
13 They are planted in the house of theLord, they flourish in the courts of our God.
14 They still bring forth fruit in old age, they are ever full of sap and green,
15 to show that theLordis upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.


# Liber Psalmorum 92 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dominus regnavit, decorem indutus est:indutus est Dominus fortitudinem, et præcinxit se.Etenim firmavit orbem terræ, qui non commovebitur.
2 Parata sedes tua ex tunc;a sæculo tu es.
3 Elevaverunt flumina, Domine,elevaverunt flumina vocem suam;elevaverunt flumina fluctus suos,
4 a vocibus aquarum multarum.Mirabiles elationes maris;mirabilis in altis Dominus.
5 Testimonia tua credibilia facta sunt nimis;domum tuam decet sanctitudo, Domine,in longitudinem dierum.


# Ψαλμοί 92 (Septuagint)

1 εἰς τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ προσαββάτου ὅτε κατῴκισται ἡ γῆ αἶνος ᾠδῆς τῷ Δαυιδ ὁ κύριος ἐβασίλευσεν εὐπρέπειαν ἐνεδύσατο ἐνεδύσατο κύριος δύναμιν καὶ περιεζώσατο καὶ γὰρ ἐστερέωσεν τὴν οἰκουμένην ἥτις οὐ σαλευθήσεται
2 ἕτοιμος ὁ θρόνος σου ἀπὸ τότε ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος σὺ εἶ
3 ἐπῆραν οἱ ποταμοί κύριε ἐπῆραν οἱ ποταμοὶ φωνὰς αὐτῶν
4 ἀπὸ φωνῶν ὑδάτων πολλῶν θαυμαστοὶ οἱ μετεωρισμοὶ τῆς θαλάσσης θαυμαστὸς ἐν ὑψηλοῖς ὁ κύριος
5 τὰ μαρτύριά σου ἐπιστώθησαν σφόδρα τῷ οἴκῳ σου πρέπει ἁγίασμα κύριε εἰς μακρότητα ἡμερῶν
