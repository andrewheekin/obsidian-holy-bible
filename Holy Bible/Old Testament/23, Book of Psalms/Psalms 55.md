# Book of Psalms 55 (RSVCE)

### Complaint about a Friend’s Treachery
1 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication!
2 Attend to me, and answer me; I am overcome by my trouble. I am distraught
3 by the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they bringltrouble upon me, and in anger they cherish enmity against me.
4 My heart is in anguish within me, the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
5 Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.
6 And I say, “O that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest;
7 yea, I would wander afar, I would lodge in the wilderness,Selah
8 I would haste to find me a shelter from the raging wind and tempest.”
9 Destroy their plans, O Lord, confuse their tongues; for I see violence and strife in the city.
10 Day and night they go around it on its walls; and mischief and trouble are within it,
11 ruin is in its midst; oppression and fraud do not depart from its market place.
12 It is not an enemy who taunts me— then I could bear it; it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me— then I could hide from him.
13 But it is you, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend.
14 We used to hold sweet converse together; within God’s house we walked in fellowship.
15 Let death come upon them; let them go down to Sheol alive; let them go away in terror into their graves.o
16 But I call upon God; and theLordwill save me.
17 Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint and moan, and he will hear my voice.
18 He will deliver my soul in safety from the battle that I wage, for many are arrayed against me.
19 God will give ear, and humble them, he who is enthroned from of old; because they keep no law,p and do not fear God.Selah
20 My companion stretched out his hand against his friends, he violated his covenant.
21 His speech was smoother than butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
22 Cast your burden on theLord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved.
23 But thou, O God, wilt cast them down into the lowest pit; men of blood and treachery shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in thee.


# Liber Psalmorum 55 (Latin Vulgate)

 In finem, pro populo qui a sanctis longe factus est. David in tituli inscriptionem, cum tenuerunt eum Allophyli in Geth.

2 Miserere mei, Deus, quoniam conculcavit me homo;tota die impugnans, tribulavit me.
3 Conculcaverunt me inimici mei tota die,quoniam multi bellantes adversum me.
4 Ab altitudine diei timebo:ego vero in te sperabo.
5 In Deo laudabo sermones meos;in Deo speravi:non timebo quid faciat mihi caro.
6 Tota die verba mea execrabantur;adversum me omnes cogitationes eorum in malum.
7 Inhabitabunt, et abscondent;ipsi calcaneum meum observabunt.Sicut sustinuerunt animam meam,
8 pro nihilo salvos facies illos;in ira populos confringes.
9 Deus, vitam meam annuntiavi tibi;posuisti lacrimas meas in conspectu tuo,sicut et in promissione tua:
10 tunc convertentur inimici mei retrorsum.In quacumque die invocavero te,ecce cognovi quoniam Deus meus es.
11 In Deo laudabo verbum;in Domino laudabo sermonem.
12 In Deo speravi:non timebo quid faciat mihi homo.
13 In me sunt, Deus, vota tua,quæ reddam, laudationes tibi:
14 quoniam eripuisti animam meam de morte,et pedes meos de lapsu,ut placeam coram Deo in lumine viventium.


# Ψαλμοί 55 (Septuagint)

 εἰς τὸ τέλος ὑπὲρ τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ἁγίων μεμακρυμμένου τῷ Δαυιδ εἰς στηλογραφίαν ὁπότε ἐκράτησαν αὐτὸν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐν Γεθ

2 ἐλέησόν με κύριε ὅτι κατεπάτησέν με ἄνθρωπος ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν πολεμῶν ἔθλιψέν με
3 κατεπάτησάν με οἱ ἐχθροί μου ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ὅτι πολλοὶ οἱ πολεμοῦντές με ἀπὸ ὕψους
4 ἡμέρας φοβηθήσομαι ἐγὼ δὲ ἐπὶ σοὶ ἐλπιῶ
5 ἐν τῷ θεῷ ἐπαινέσω τοὺς λόγους μου ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐπὶ τῷ θεῷ ἤλπισα οὐ φοβηθήσομαι τί ποιήσει μοι σάρξ
6 ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν τοὺς λόγους μου ἐβδελύσσοντο κα{T'} ἐμοῦ πάντες οἱ διαλογισμοὶ αὐτῶν εἰς κακόν
7 παροικήσουσιν καὶ κατακρύψουσιν αὐτοὶ τὴν πτέρναν μου φυλάξουσιν καθάπερ ὑπέμειναν τὴν ψυχήν μου
8 ὑπὲρ τοῦ μηθενὸς σώσεις αὐτούς ἐν ὀργῇ λαοὺς κατάξεις ὁ θεός
9 τὴν ζωήν μου ἐξήγγειλά σοι ἔθου τὰ δάκρυά μου ἐνώπιόν σου ὡς καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐπαγγελίᾳ σου
10 ἐπιστρέψουσιν οἱ ἐχθροί μου εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω ἐν ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἐπικαλέσωμαί σε ἰδοὺ ἔγνων ὅτι θεός μου εἶ σύ
11 ἐπὶ τῷ θεῷ αἰνέσω ῥῆμα ἐπὶ τῷ κυρίῳ αἰνέσω λόγον
12 ἐπὶ τῷ θεῷ ἤλπισα οὐ φοβηθήσομαι τί ποιήσει μοι ἄνθρωπος
13 ἐν ἐμοί ὁ θεός αἱ εὐχαὶ ἃς ἀποδώσω αἰνέσεώς σοι
14 ὅτι ἐρρύσω τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐκ θανάτου καὶ τοὺς πόδας μου ἐξ ὀλισθήματος τοῦ εὐαρεστῆσαι ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν φωτὶ ζώντων
