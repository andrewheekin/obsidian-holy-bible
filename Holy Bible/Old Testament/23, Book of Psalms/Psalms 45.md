# Book of Psalms 45 (RSVCE)

### Ode for a Royal Wedding
1 My heart overflows with a goodly theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.
2 You are the fairest of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you for ever.
3 Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, in your glory and majesty!
4 In your majesty ride forth victoriously for the cause of truth and to defendhthe right; let your right hand teach you dread deeds!
5 Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies; the peoples fall under you.
6 Your divine throne endures for ever and ever. Your royal scepter is a scepter of equity;
7 you love righteousness and hate wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows;
8 your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad;
9 daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
10 Hear, O daughter, consider, and incline your ear; forget your people and your father’s house;
11 and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him;
12 the people of Tyre will sue your favor with gifts, the richest of the people
13 with all kinds of wealth. The princess is decked in her chamber with gold-woven robes;k
14 in many-colored robes she is led to the king, with her virgin companions, her escort,lin her train.
15 With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king.
16 Instead of your fathers shall be your sons; you will make them princes in all the earth.
17 I will cause your name to be celebrated in all generations; therefore the peoples will praise you for ever and ever.


# Liber Psalmorum 45 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In finem, filiis Core, pro arcanis. Psalmus.

2 Deus noster refugium et virtus;adjutor in tribulationibus quæ invenerunt nos nimis.
3 Propterea non timebimus dum turbabitur terra,et transferentur montes in cor maris.
4 Sonuerunt, et turbatæ sunt aquæ eorum;conturbati sunt montes in fortitudine ejus.
5 Fluminis impetus lætificat civitatem Dei:sanctificavit tabernaculum suum Altissimus.
6 Deus in medio ejus, non commovebitur;adjuvabit eam Deus mane diluculo.
7 Conturbatæ sunt gentes, et inclinata sunt regna:dedit vocem suam, mota est terra.
8 Dominus virtutum nobiscum;susceptor noster Deus Jacob.
9 Venite, et videte opera Domini,quæ posuit prodigia super terram,
10 auferens bella usque ad finem terræ.Arcum conteret, et confringet arma,et scuta comburet igni.
11 Vacate, et videte quoniam ego sum Deus;exaltabor in gentibus, et exaltabor in terra.
12 Dominus virtutum nobiscum;susceptor noster Deus Jacob.


# Ψαλμοί 45 (Septuagint)

1 εἰς τὸ τέλος ὑπὲρ τῶν υἱῶν Κορε ὑπὲρ τῶν κρυφίων ψαλμός

2 ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν καταφυγὴ καὶ δύναμις βοηθὸς ἐν θλίψεσιν ταῖς εὑρούσαις ἡμᾶς σφόδρα
3 διὰ τοῦτο οὐ φοβηθησόμεθα ἐν τῷ ταράσσεσθαι τὴν γῆν καὶ μετατίθεσθαι ὄρη ἐν καρδίαις θαλασσῶν
4 ἤχησαν καὶ ἐταράχθησαν τὰ ὕδατα αὐτῶν ἐταράχθησαν τὰ ὄρη ἐν τῇ κραταιότητι αὐτοῦ διάψαλμα
5 τοῦ ποταμοῦ τὰ ὁρμήματα εὐφραίνουσιν τὴν πόλιν τοῦ θεοῦ ἡγίασεν τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ ὁ ὕψιστος
6 ὁ θεὸς ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς οὐ σαλευθήσεται βοηθήσει αὐτῇ ὁ θεὸς τὸ πρὸς πρωί
7 ἐταράχθησαν ἔθνη ἔκλιναν βασιλεῖαι ἔδωκεν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ ἐσαλεύθη ἡ γῆ
8 κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων με{Q'} ἡμῶν ἀντιλήμπτωρ ἡμῶν ὁ θεὸς Ιακωβ διάψαλμα
9 δεῦτε ἴδετε τὰ ἔργα κυρίου ἃ ἔθετο τέρατα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
10 ἀνταναιρῶν πολέμους μέχρι τῶν περάτων τῆς γῆς τόξον συντρίψει καὶ συγκλάσει ὅπλον καὶ θυρεοὺς κατακαύσει ἐν πυρί
11 σχολάσατε καὶ γνῶτε ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ θεός ὑψωθήσομαι ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ὑψωθήσομαι ἐν τῇ γῇ
12 κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων με{Q'} ἡμῶν ἀντιλήμπτωρ ἡμῶν ὁ θεὸς Ιακωβ
