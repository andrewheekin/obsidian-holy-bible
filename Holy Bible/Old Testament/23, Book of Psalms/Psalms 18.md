# Book of Psalms 18 (RSVCE)

### Royal Thanksgiving for Victory
1 I love thee, OLord, my strength.
2 TheLordis my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
3 I call upon theLord, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.
4 The cords of death encompassed me, the torrents of perdition assailed me;
5 the cords of Sheol entangled me, the snares of death confronted me.
6 In my distress I called upon theLord; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.
7 Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.
8 Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.
9 He bowed the heavens, and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.
10 He rode on a cherub, and flew; he came swiftly upon the wings of the wind.
11 He made darkness his covering around him, his canopy thick clouds dark with water.
12 Out of the brightness before him there broke through his clouds hailstones and coals of fire.
13 TheLordalso thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.
14 And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings, and routed them.
15 Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare, at thy rebuke, OLord, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
16 He reached from on high, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
18 They came upon me in the day of my calamity; but theLordwas my stay.
19 He brought me forth into a broad place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
20 TheLordrewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.
21 For I have kept the ways of theLord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
22 For all his ordinances were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.
23 I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from guilt.
24 Therefore theLordhas recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
25 With the loyal thou dost show thyself loyal; with the blameless man thou dost show thyself blameless;
26 with the pure thou dost show thyself pure; and with the crooked thou dost show thyself perverse.
27 For thou dost deliver a humble people; but the haughty eyes thou dost bring down.
28 Yea, thou dost light my lamp; theLordmy God lightens my darkness.
29 Yea, by thee I can crush a troop; and by my God I can leap over a wall.
30 This God—his way is perfect; the promise of theLordproves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.
31 For who is God, but theLord? And who is a rock, except our God?—
32 the God who girded me with strength, and made my way safe.
33 He made my feet like hinds’ feet, and set me secure on the heights.
34 He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
35 Thou hast given me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand supported me, and thy helpjmade me great.
36 Thou didst give a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.
37 I pursued my enemies and overtook them; and did not turn back till they were consumed.
38 I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.
39 For thou didst gird me with strength for the battle; thou didst make my assailants sink under me.
40 Thou didst make my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.
41 They cried for help, but there was none to save, they cried to theLord, but he did not answer them.
42 I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.
43 Thou didst deliver me from strife with the peoples; thou didst make me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.
44 As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.
45 Foreigners lost heart, and came trembling out of their fastnesses.
46 TheLordlives; and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation,
47 the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me;
48 who delivered me from my enemies; yea, thou didst exalt me above my adversaries; thou didst deliver me from men of violence.
49 For this I will extol thee, OLord, among the nations, and sing praises to thy name.
50 Great triumphs he gives to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his descendants for ever.


# Liber Psalmorum 18 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In finem. Psalmus David.

2 Cæli enarrant gloriam Dei,et opera manuum ejus annuntiat firmamentum.
3 Dies diei eructat verbum,et nox nocti indicat scientiam.
4 Non sunt loquelæ, neque sermones,quorum non audiantur voces eorum.
5 In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum,et in fines orbis terræ verba eorum.
6 In sole posuit tabernaculum suum;et ipse tamquam sponsus procedens de thalamo suo.Exsultavit ut gigas ad currendam viam;
7 a summo cælo egressio ejus.Et occursus ejus usque ad summum ejus;nec est qui se abscondat a calore ejus.

8 Lex Domini immaculata, convertens animas;testimonium Domini fidele, sapientiam præstans parvulis.
9 Justitiæ Domini rectæ, lætificantes corda;præceptum Domini lucidum, illuminans oculos.
10 Timor Domini sanctus, permanens in sæculum sæculi;judicia Domini vera, justificata in semetipsa,
11 desiderabilia super aurum et lapidem pretiosum multum,et dulciora super mel et favum.
12 Etenim servus tuus custodit ea;in custodiendis illis retributio multa.
13 Delicta quis intelligit?ab occultis meis munda me;
14 et ab alienis parce servo tuo.Si mei non fuerint dominati, tunc immaculatus ero,et emundabor a delicto maximo.
15 Et erunt ut complaceant eloquia oris mei,et meditatio cordis mei in conspectu tuo semper.Domine, adjutor meus, et redemptor meus.


# Ψαλμοί 18 (Septuagint)

1 εἰς τὸ τέλος ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυιδ

2 οἱ οὐρανοὶ διηγοῦνται δόξαν θεοῦ ποίησιν δὲ χειρῶν αὐτοῦ ἀναγγέλλει τὸ στερέωμα
3 ἡμέρα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐρεύγεται ῥῆμα καὶ νὺξ νυκτὶ ἀναγγέλλει γνῶσιν
4 οὐκ εἰσὶν λαλιαὶ οὐδὲ λόγοι ὧν οὐχὶ ἀκούονται αἱ φωναὶ αὐτῶν
5 εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἐξῆλθεν ὁ φθόγγος αὐτῶν καὶ εἰς τὰ πέρατα τῆς οἰκουμένης τὰ ῥήματα αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ ἡλίῳ ἔθετο τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ αὐτὸς ὡς νυμφίος ἐκπορευόμενος ἐκ παστοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀγαλλιάσεται ὡς γίγας δραμεῖν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ
7 ἀ{P'} ἄκρου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἡ ἔξοδος αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ κατάντημα αὐτοῦ ἕως ἄκρου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἀποκρυβήσεται τὴν θέρμην αὐτοῦ

8 ὁ νόμος τοῦ κυρίου ἄμωμος ἐπιστρέφων ψυχάς ἡ μαρτυρία κυρίου πιστή σοφίζουσα νήπια
9 τὰ δικαιώματα κυρίου εὐθεῖα εὐφραίνοντα καρδίαν ἡ ἐντολὴ κυρίου τηλαυγής φωτίζουσα ὀφθαλμούς
10 ὁ φόβος κυρίου ἁγνός διαμένων εἰς αἰῶνα αἰῶνος τὰ κρίματα κυρίου ἀληθινά δεδικαιωμένα ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό
11 ἐπιθυμητὰ ὑπὲρ χρυσίον καὶ λίθον τίμιον πολὺν καὶ γλυκύτερα ὑπὲρ μέλι καὶ κηρίον
12 καὶ γὰρ ὁ δοῦλός σου φυλάσσει αὐτά ἐν τῷ φυλάσσειν αὐτὰ ἀνταπόδοσις πολλή
13 παραπτώματα τίς συνήσει ἐκ τῶν κρυφίων μου καθάρισόν με
14 καὶ ἀπὸ ἀλλοτρίων φεῖσαι τοῦ δούλου σου ἐὰν μή μου κατακυριεύσωσιν τότε ἄμωμος ἔσομαι καὶ καθαρισθήσομαι ἀπὸ ἁμαρτίας μεγάλης
15 καὶ ἔσονται εἰς εὐδοκίαν τὰ λόγια τοῦ στόματός μου καὶ ἡ μελέτη τῆς καρδίας μου ἐνώπιόν σου διὰ παντός κύριε βοηθέ μου καὶ λυτρωτά μου
