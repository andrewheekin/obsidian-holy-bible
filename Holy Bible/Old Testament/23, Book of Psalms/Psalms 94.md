# Book of Psalms 94 (RSVCE)

### God the Avenger of the Righteous
1 OLord, thou God of vengeance, thou God of vengeance, shine forth!
2 Rise up, O judge of the earth; render to the proud their deserts!
3 OLord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?
4 They pour out their arrogant words, they boast, all the evildoers.
5 They crush thy people, OLord, and afflict thy heritage.
6 They slay the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless;
7 and they say, “TheLorddoes not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive.”
8 Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise?
9 He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?
10 He who chastens the nations, does he not chastise? He who teaches men knowledge,
11 theLord, knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath.
12 Blessed is the man whom thou dost chasten, OLord, and whom thou dost teach out of thy law
13 to give him respite from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
14 For theLordwill not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage;
15 for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
16 Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers?
17 If theLordhad not been my help, my soul would soon have dwelt in the land of silence.
18 When I thought, “My foot slips,” thy steadfast love, OLord, held me up.
19 When the cares of my heart are many, thy consolations cheer my soul.
20 Can wicked rulers be allied with thee, who frame mischief by statute?
21 They band together against the life of the righteous, and condemn the innocent to death.
22 But theLordhas become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge.
23 He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; theLordour God will wipe them out.


# Liber Psalmorum 94 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Venite, exsultemus Domino;jubilemus Deo salutari nostro;
2 præoccupemus faciem ejus in confessione,et in psalmis jubilemus ei:
3 quoniam Deus magnus Dominus,et rex magnus super omnes deos.
4 Quia in manu ejus sunt omnes fines terræ,et altitudines montium ipsius sunt;
5 quoniam ipsius est mare, et ipse fecit illud,et siccam manus ejus formaverunt.
6 Venite, adoremus, et procidamus,et ploremus ante Dominum qui fecit nos:
7 quia ipse est Dominus Deus noster,et nos populus pascuæ ejus, et oves manus ejus.

8 Hodie si vocem ejus audieritis,nolite obdurare corda vestra
9 sicut in irritatione,secundum diem tentationis in deserto,ubi tentaverunt me patres vestri:probaverunt me, et viderunt opera mea.
10 Quadraginta annis offensus fui generationi illi,et dixi: Semper hi errant corde.
11 Et isti non cognoverunt vias meas:ut juravi in ira mea:Si introibunt in requiem meam.


# Ψαλμοί 94 (Septuagint)

1 αἶνος ᾠδῆς τῷ Δαυιδ δεῦτε ἀγαλλιασώμεθα τῷ κυρίῳ ἀλαλάξωμεν τῷ θεῷ τῷ σωτῆρι ἡμῶν
2 προφθάσωμεν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐξομολογήσει καὶ ἐν ψαλμοῖς ἀλαλάξωμεν αὐτῷ
3 ὅτι θεὸς μέγας κύριος καὶ βασιλεὺς μέγας ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς θεούς
4 ὅτι ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὰ πέρατα τῆς γῆς καὶ τὰ ὕψη τῶν ὀρέων αὐτοῦ εἰσιν
5 ὅτι αὐτοῦ ἐστιν ἡ θάλασσα καὶ αὐτὸς ἐποίησεν αὐτήν καὶ τὴν ξηρὰν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ ἔπλασαν
6 δεῦτε προσκυνήσωμεν καὶ προσπέσωμεν αὐτῷ καὶ κλαύσωμεν ἐναντίον κυρίου τοῦ ποιήσαντος ἡμᾶς
7 ὅτι αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν καὶ ἡμεῖς λαὸς νομῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ πρόβατα χειρὸς αὐτοῦ σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε

8 μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν ὡς ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ κατὰ τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ πειρασμοῦ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ
9 οὗ ἐπείρασαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν ἐδοκίμασαν καὶ εἴδοσαν τὰ ἔργα μου
10 τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη προσώχθισα τῇ γενεᾷ ἐκείνῃ καὶ εἶπα ἀεὶ πλανῶνται τῇ καρδίᾳ καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὰς ὁδούς μου
11 ὡς ὤμοσα ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ μου εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου
