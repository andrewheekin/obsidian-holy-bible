# Book of Psalms 14 (RSVCE)

### Denunciation of Godlessness
1 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none that does good.
2 TheLordlooks down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there are any that act wisely, that seek after God.
3 They have all gone astray, they are all alike corrupt; there is none that does good, no, not one.
4 Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon theLord?
5 There they shall be in great terror, for God is with the generation of the righteous.
6 You would confound the plans of the poor, but theLordis his refuge.
7 O that deliverance for Israel would come out of Zion! When theLordrestores the fortunes of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, Israel shall be glad.


# Liber Psalmorum 14 (Latin Vulgate)

 Psalmus David.

1 Domine, quis habitabit in tabernaculo tuo?aut quis requiescet in monte sancto tuo?
2 Qui ingreditur sine macula,et operatur justitiam;
3 qui loquitur veritatem in corde suo:qui non egit dolum in lingua sua,nec fecit proximo suo malum,et opprobrium non accepit adversus proximos suos.
4 Ad nihilum deductus est in conspectu ejus malignus;timentes autem Dominum glorificat.Qui jurat proximo suo, et non decipit;
5 qui pecuniam suam non dedit ad usuram,et munera super innocentem non accepit:qui facit hæc non movebitur in æternum.


# Ψαλμοί 14 (Septuagint)

1 ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυιδ κύριε τίς παροικήσει ἐν τῷ σκηνώματί σου καὶ τίς κατασκηνώσει ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ ἁγίῳ σου
2 πορευόμενος ἄμωμος καὶ ἐργαζόμενος δικαιοσύνην λαλῶν ἀλήθειαν ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ
3 ὃς οὐκ ἐδόλωσεν ἐν γλώσσῃ αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ ἐποίησεν τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ κακὸν καὶ ὀνειδισμὸν οὐκ ἔλαβεν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἔγγιστα αὐτοῦ
4 ἐξουδένωται ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ πονηρευόμενος τοὺς δὲ φοβουμένους κύριον δοξάζει ὁ ὀμνύων τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἀθετῶν
5 τὸ ἀργύριον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔδωκεν ἐπὶ τόκῳ καὶ δῶρα ἐ{P'} ἀθῴοις οὐκ ἔλαβεν ὁ ποιῶν ταῦτα οὐ σαλευθήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
