# Book of Psalms 35 (RSVCE)

### Prayer for Deliverance from Enemies
1 Contend, OLord, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me!
2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help!
3 Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers! Say to my soul, “I am your deliverance!”
4 Let them be put to shame and dishonor who seek after my life! Let them be turned back and confounded who devise evil against me!
5 Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of theLorddriving them on!
6 Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of theLordpursuing them!
7 For without cause they hid their net for me; without cause they dug a pittfor my life.
8 Let ruin come upon them unawares! And let the net which they hid ensnare them; let them fall therein to ruin!
9 Then my soul shall rejoice in theLord, exulting in his deliverance.
10 All my bones shall say, “OLord, who is like thee, thou who deliverest the weak from him who is too strong for him, the weak and needy from him who despoils him?”
11 Malicious witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I know not.
12 They requite me evil for good; my soul is forlorn.
13 But I, when they were sick— I wore sackcloth, I afflicted myself with fasting. I prayed with head boweduon my bosom,
14 as though I grieved for my friend or my brother; I went about as one who laments his mother, bowed down and in mourning.
15 But at my stumbling they gathered in glee, they gathered together against me; cripples whom I knew not slandered me without ceasing;
16 they impiously mocked more and more, gnashing at me with their teeth.
17 How long, OLord, wilt thou look on? Rescue me from their ravages, my life from the lions!
18 Then I will thank thee in the great congregation; in the mighty throng I will praise thee.
19 Let not those rejoice over me who are wrongfully my foes, and let not those wink the eye who hate me without cause.
20 For they do not speak peace, but against those who are quiet in the land they conceive words of deceit.
21 They open wide their mouths against me; they say, “Aha, Aha! our eyes have seen it!”
22 Thou hast seen, OLord; be not silent! O Lord, be not far from me!
23 Bestir thyself, and awake for my right, for my cause, my God and my Lord!
24 Vindicate me, OLord, my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me!
25 Let them not say to themselves, “Aha, we have our heart’s desire!” Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up.”
26 Let them be put to shame and confusion altogether who rejoice at my calamity! Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me!
27 Let those who desire my vindication shout for joy and be glad, and say evermore, “Great is theLord, who delights in the welfare of his servant!”
28 Then my tongue shall tell of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.


# Liber Psalmorum 35 (Latin Vulgate)

 In finem. Servo Domini ipsi David.

2 Dixit injustus ut delinquat in semetipso:non est timor Dei ante oculos ejus.
3 Quoniam dolose egit in conspectu ejus,ut inveniatur iniquitas ejus ad odium.
4 Verba oris ejus iniquitas, et dolus;noluit intelligere ut bene ageret.
5 Iniquitatem meditatus est in cubili suo;astitit omni viæ non bonæ:malitiam autem non odivit.

6 Domine, in cælo misericordia tua,et veritas tua usque ad nubes.
7 Justitia tua sicut montes Dei;judicia tua abyssus multa.Homines et jumenta salvabis, Domine,
8 quemadmodum multiplicasti misericordiam tuam, Deus.Filii autem hominum in tegmine alarum tuarum sperabunt.
9 Inebriabuntur ab ubertate domus tuæ,et torrente voluptatis tuæ potabis eos:
10 quoniam apud te est fons vitæ,et in lumine tuo videbimus lumen.
11 Prætende misericordiam tuam scientibus te,et justitiam tuam his qui recto sunt corde.
12 Non veniat mihi pes superbiæ,et manus peccatoris non moveat me.
13 Ibi ceciderunt qui operantur iniquitatem;expulsi sunt, nec potuerunt stare.


# Ψαλμοί 35 (Septuagint)

 εἰς τὸ τέλος τῷ δούλῳ κυρίου τῷ Δαυιδ

2 φησὶν ὁ παράνομος τοῦ ἁμαρτάνειν ἐν ἑαυτῷ οὐκ ἔστιν φόβος θεοῦ ἀπέναντι τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ
3 ὅτι ἐδόλωσεν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ τοῦ εὑρεῖν τὴν ἀνομίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ μισῆσαι
4 τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ ἀνομία καὶ δόλος οὐκ ἐβουλήθη συνιέναι τοῦ ἀγαθῦναι
5 ἀνομίαν διελογίσατο ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ παρέστη πάσῃ ὁδῷ οὐκ ἀγαθῇ τῇ δὲ κακίᾳ οὐ προσώχθισεν

6 κύριε ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ τὸ ἔλεός σου καὶ ἡ ἀλήθειά σου ἕως τῶν νεφελῶν
7 ἡ δικαιοσύνη σου ὡσεὶ ὄρη θεοῦ τὰ κρίματά σου ἄβυσσος πολλή ἀνθρώπους καὶ κτήνη σώσεις κύριε
8 ὡς ἐπλήθυνας τὸ ἔλεός σου ὁ θεός οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐν σκέπῃ τῶν πτερύγων σου ἐλπιοῦσιν
9 μεθυσθήσονται ἀπὸ πιότητος τοῦ οἴκου σου καὶ τὸν χειμάρρουν τῆς τρυφῆς σου ποτιεῖς αὐτούς
10 ὅτι παρὰ σοὶ πηγὴ ζωῆς ἐν τῷ φωτί σου ὀψόμεθα φῶς
11 παράτεινον τὸ ἔλεός σου τοῖς γινώσκουσίν σε καὶ τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου τοῖς εὐθέσι τῇ καρδίᾳ
12 μὴ ἐλθέτω μοι ποὺς ὑπερηφανίας καὶ χεὶρ ἁμαρτωλῶν μὴ σαλεύσαι με
13 ἐκεῖ ἔπεσον οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν ἀνομίαν ἐξώσθησαν καὶ οὐ μὴ δύνωνται στῆναι
