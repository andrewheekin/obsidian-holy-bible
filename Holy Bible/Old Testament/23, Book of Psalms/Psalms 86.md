# Book of Psalms 86 (RSVCE)

### Supplication for Help against Enemies
1 Incline thy ear, OLord, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
2 Preserve my life, for I am godly; save thy servant who trusts in thee. Thou art my God;
3 be gracious to me, O Lord, for to thee do I cry all the day.
4 Gladden the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
5 For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, abounding in steadfast love to all who call on thee.
6 Give ear, OLord, to my prayer; hearken to my cry of supplication.
7 In the day of my trouble I call on thee, for thou dost answer me.
8 There is none like thee among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like thine.
9 All the nations thou hast made shall come and bow down before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name.
10 For thou art great and doest wondrous things, thou alone art God.
11 Teach me thy way, OLord, that I may walk in thy truth; unite my heart to fear thy name.
12 I give thanks to thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify thy name for ever.
13 For great is thy steadfast love toward me; thou hast delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.
14 O God, insolent men have risen up against me; a band of ruthless men seek my life, and they do not set thee before them.
15 But thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.
16 Turn to me and take pity on me; give thy strength to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.
17 Show me a sign of thy favor, that those who hate me may see and be put to shame because thou,Lord, hast helped me and comforted me.


# Liber Psalmorum 86 (Latin Vulgate)

 Filiis Core. Psalmus cantici.

1 Fundamenta ejus in montibus sanctis;
2 diligit Dominus portas Sion super omnia tabernacula Jacob.
3 Gloriosa dicta sunt de te, civitas Dei!
4 Memor ero Rahab et Babylonis, scientium me;ecce alienigenæ, et Tyrus, et populus Æthiopum,hi fuerunt illic.
5 Numquid Sion dicet: Homo et homo natus est in ea,et ipse fundavit eam Altissimus?
6 Dominus narrabit in scripturis populorum et principum,horum qui fuerunt in ea.
7 Sicut lætantium omniumhabitatio est in te.


# Ψαλμοί 86 (Septuagint)

1 τοῖς υἱοῖς Κορε ψαλμὸς ᾠδῆς οἱ θεμέλιοι αὐτοῦ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν τοῖς ἁγίοις
2 ἀγαπᾷ κύριος τὰς πύλας Σιων ὑπὲρ πάντα τὰ σκηνώματα Ιακωβ
3 δεδοξασμένα ἐλαλήθη περὶ σοῦ ἡ πόλις τοῦ θεοῦ διάψαλμα
4 μνησθήσομαι Ρααβ καὶ Βαβυλῶνος τοῖς γινώσκουσίν με καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ Τύρος καὶ λαὸς Αἰθιόπων οὗτοι ἐγενήθησαν ἐκεῖ
5 μήτηρ Σιων ἐρεῖ ἄνθρωπος καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἐγενήθη ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐθεμελίωσεν αὐτὴν ὁ ὕψιστος
6 κύριος διηγήσεται ἐν γραφῇ λαῶν καὶ ἀρχόντων τούτων τῶν γεγενημένων ἐν αὐτῇ διάψαλμα
7 ὡς εὐφραινομένων πάντων ἡ κατοικία ἐν σοί
