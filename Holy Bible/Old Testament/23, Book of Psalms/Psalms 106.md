# Book of Psalms 106 (RSVCE)

### A Confession of Israel’s Sins
1 Praise theLord! O give thanks to theLord, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever!
2 Who can utter the mighty doings of theLord, or show forth all his praise?
3 Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times!
4 Remember me, OLord, when thou showest favor to thy people; help me when thou deliverest them;
5 that I may see the prosperity of thy chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thy heritage.
6 Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
7 Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider thy wonderful works; they did not remember the abundance of thy steadfast love, but rebelled against the Most Highy at the Red Sea.
8 Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make known his mighty power.
9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry; and he led them through the deep as through a desert.
10 So he saved them from the hand of the foe, and delivered them from the power of the enemy.
11 And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.
12 Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
13 But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.
14 But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;
15 he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.
16 When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of theLord,
17 the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiʹram.
18 Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
19 They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a molten image.
20 They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
21 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
22 wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea.
23 Therefore he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.
24 Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.
25 They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of theLord.
26 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,
27 and would disperse their descendants among the nations, scattering them over the lands.
28 Then they attached themselves to the Baʹal of Peʹor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;
29 they provoked theLordto anger with their doings, and a plague broke out among them.
30 Then Phinʹehas stood up and interposed, and the plague was stayed.
31 And that has been reckoned to him as righteousness from generation to generation for ever.
32 They angered him at the waters of Merʹibah, and it went ill with Moses on their account;
33 for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke words that were rash.
34 They did not destroy the peoples, as theLordcommanded them,
35 but they mingled with the nations and learned to do as they did.
36 They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
37 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;
38 they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.
39 Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the harlot in their doings.
40 Then the anger of theLordwas kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;
41 he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.
42 Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.
43 Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes, and were brought low through their iniquity.
44 Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.
45 He remembered for their sake his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
46 He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive.
47 Save us, OLordour God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praise.
48 Blessed be theLord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, “Amen!” Praise theLord!


# Liber Psalmorum 106 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Confitemini Domino, quoniam bonus,quoniam in sæculum misericordia ejus.
2 Dicant qui redempti sunt a Domino,quos redemit de manu inimici,et de regionibus congregavit eos,
3 a solis ortu, et occasu, ab aquilone, et mari.

4 Erraverunt in solitudine, in inaquoso;viam civitatis habitaculi non invenerunt.
5 Esurientes et sitientes,anima eorum in ipsis defecit.
6 Et clamaverunt ad Dominum cum tribularentur,et de necessitatibus eorum eripuit eos;
7 et deduxit eos in viam rectam,ut irent in civitatem habitationis.
8 Confiteantur Domino misericordiæ ejus,et mirabilia ejus filiis hominum.
9 Quia satiavit animam inanem,et animam esurientem satiavit bonis.

10 Sedentes in tenebris et umbra mortis;vinctos in mendicitate et ferro.
11 Quia exacerbaverunt eloquia Dei,et consilium Altissimi irritaverunt.
12 Et humiliatum est in laboribus cor eorum;infirmati sunt, nec fuit qui adjuvaret.
13 Et clamaverunt ad Dominum cum tribularentur;et de necessitatibus eorum liberavit eos.
14 Et eduxit eos de tenebris et umbra mortis,et vincula eorum dirupit.
15 Confiteantur Domino misericordiæ ejus,et mirabilia ejus filiis hominum.
16 Quia contrivit portas æreas,et vectes ferreos confregit.

17 Suscepit eos de via iniquitatis eorum;propter injustitias enim suas humiliati sunt.
18 Omnem escam abominata est anima eorum,et appropinquaverunt usque ad portas mortis.
19 Et clamaverunt ad Dominum cum tribularentur,et de necessitatibus eorum liberavit eos.
20 Misit verbum suum, et sanavit eos,et eripuit eos de interitionibus eorum.
21 Confiteantur Domino misericordiæ ejus,et mirabilia ejus filiis hominum.
22 Et sacrificent sacrificium laudis,et annuntient opera ejus in exsultatione.

23 Qui descendunt mare in navibus,facientes operationem in aquis multis:
24 ipsi viderunt opera Domini,et mirabilia ejus in profundo.
25 Dixit, et stetit spiritus procellæ,et exaltati sunt fluctus ejus.
26 Ascendunt usque ad cælos, et descendunt usque ad abyssos;anima eorum in malis tabescebat.
27 Turbati sunt, et moti sunt sicut ebrius,et omnis sapientia eorum devorata est.
28 Et clamaverunt ad Dominum cum tribularentur;et de necessitatibus eorum eduxit eos.
29 Et statuit procellam ejus in auram,et siluerunt fluctus ejus.
30 Et lætati sunt quia siluerunt;et deduxit eos in portum voluntatis eorum.
31 Confiteantur Domino misericordiæ ejus,et mirabilia ejus filiis hominum.
32 Et exaltent eum in ecclesia plebis,et in cathedra seniorum laudent eum.

33 Posuit flumina in desertum,et exitus aquarum in sitim;
34 terram fructiferam in salsuginem,a malitia inhabitantium in ea.
35 Posuit desertum in stagna aquarum,et terram sine aqua in exitus aquarum.
36 Et collocavit illic esurientes,et constituerunt civitatem habitationis:
37 et seminaverunt agros et plantaverunt vineas,et fecerunt fructum nativitatis.
38 Et benedixit eis, et multiplicati sunt nimis;et jumenta eorum non minoravit.
39 Et pauci facti sunt et vexati sunt,a tribulatione malorum et dolore.
40 Effusa est contemptio super principes:et errare fecit eos in invio, et non in via.
41 Et adjuvit pauperem de inopia,et posuit sicut oves familias.
42 Videbunt recti, et lætabuntur;et omnis iniquitas oppilabit os suum.
43 Quis sapiens, et custodiet hæc,et intelliget misericordias Domini?


# Ψαλμοί 106 (Septuagint)

1 αλληλουια ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ κυρίῳ ὅτι χρηστός ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ
2 εἰπάτωσαν οἱ λελυτρωμένοι ὑπὸ κυρίου οὓς ἐλυτρώσατο ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθροῦ
3 ἐκ τῶν χωρῶν συνήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν καὶ δυσμῶν καὶ βορρᾶ καὶ θαλάσσης

4 ἐπλανήθησαν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐν ἀνύδρῳ ὁδὸν πόλεως κατοικητηρίου οὐχ εὗρον
5 πεινῶντες καὶ διψῶντες ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐξέλιπεν
6 καὶ ἐκέκραξαν πρὸς κύριον ἐν τῷ θλίβεσθαι αὐτούς καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀναγκῶν αὐτῶν ἐρρύσατο αὐτοὺς
7 καὶ ὡδήγησεν αὐτοὺς εἰς ὁδὸν εὐθεῖαν τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς πόλιν κατοικητηρίου
8 ἐξομολογησάσθωσαν τῷ κυρίῳ τὰ ἐλέη αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων
9 ὅτι ἐχόρτασεν ψυχὴν κενὴν καὶ ψυχὴν πεινῶσαν ἐνέπλησεν ἀγαθῶν

10 καθημένους ἐν σκότει καὶ σκιᾷ θανάτου πεπεδημένους ἐν πτωχείᾳ καὶ σιδήρῳ
11 ὅτι παρεπίκραναν τὰ λόγια τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ ὑψίστου παρώξυναν
12 καὶ ἐταπεινώθη ἐν κόποις ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν ἠσθένησαν καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ βοηθῶν
13 καὶ ἐκέκραξαν πρὸς κύριον ἐν τῷ θλίβεσθαι αὐτούς καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀναγκῶν αὐτῶν ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς
14 καὶ ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ σκότους καὶ σκιᾶς θανάτου καὶ τοὺς δεσμοὺς αὐτῶν διέρρηξεν
15 ἐξομολογησάσθωσαν τῷ κυρίῳ τὰ ἐλέη αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων
16 ὅτι συνέτριψεν πύλας χαλκᾶς καὶ μοχλοὺς σιδηροῦς συνέκλασεν

17 ἀντελάβετο αὐτῶν ἐξ ὁδοῦ ἀνομίας αὐτῶν διὰ γὰρ τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν ἐταπεινώθησαν
18 πᾶν βρῶμα ἐβδελύξατο ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν καὶ ἤγγισαν ἕως τῶν πυλῶν τοῦ θανάτου
19 καὶ ἐκέκραξαν πρὸς κύριον ἐν τῷ θλίβεσθαι αὐτούς καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀναγκῶν αὐτῶν ἔσωσεν αὐτούς
20 ἀπέστειλεν τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἰάσατο αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐρρύσατο αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν διαφθορῶν αὐτῶν
21 ἐξομολογησάσθωσαν τῷ κυρίῳ τὰ ἐλέη αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων
22 καὶ θυσάτωσαν θυσίαν αἰνέσεως καὶ ἐξαγγειλάτωσαν τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει

23 οἱ καταβαίνοντες εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν ἐν πλοίοις ποιοῦντες ἐργασίαν ἐν ὕδασι πολλοῖς
24 αὐτοὶ εἴδοσαν τὰ ἔργα κυρίου καὶ τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ βυθῷ
25 εἶπεν καὶ ἔστη πνεῦμα καταιγίδος καὶ ὑψώθη τὰ κύματα αὐτῆς
26 ἀναβαίνουσιν ἕως τῶν οὐρανῶν καὶ καταβαίνουσιν ἕως τῶν ἀβύσσων ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν ἐν κακοῖς ἐτήκετο
27 ἐταράχθησαν ἐσαλεύθησαν ὡς ὁ μεθύων καὶ πᾶσα ἡ σοφία αὐτῶν κατεπόθη
28 καὶ ἐκέκραξαν πρὸς κύριον ἐν τῷ θλίβεσθαι αὐτούς καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀναγκῶν αὐτῶν ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς
29 καὶ ἐπέταξεν τῇ καταιγίδι καὶ ἔστη εἰς αὔραν καὶ ἐσίγησαν τὰ κύματα αὐτῆς
30 καὶ εὐφράνθησαν ὅτι ἡσύχασαν καὶ ὡδήγησεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ λιμένα θελήματος αὐτῶν
31 ἐξομολογησάσθωσαν τῷ κυρίῳ τὰ ἐλέη αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων
32 ὑψωσάτωσαν αὐτὸν ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ λαοῦ καὶ ἐν καθέδρᾳ πρεσβυτέρων αἰνεσάτωσαν αὐτόν

33 ἔθετο ποταμοὺς εἰς ἔρημον καὶ διεξόδους ὑδάτων εἰς δίψαν
34 γῆν καρποφόρον εἰς ἅλμην ἀπὸ κακίας τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν αὐτῇ
35 ἔθετο ἔρημον εἰς λίμνας ὑδάτων καὶ γῆν ἄνυδρον εἰς διεξόδους ὑδάτων
36 καὶ κατῴκισεν ἐκεῖ πεινῶντας καὶ συνεστήσαντο πόλιν κατοικεσίας
37 καὶ ἔσπειραν ἀγροὺς καὶ ἐφύτευσαν ἀμπελῶνας καὶ ἐποίησαν καρπὸν γενήματος
38 καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτούς καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν σφόδρα καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐσμίκρυνεν
39 καὶ ὠλιγώθησαν καὶ ἐκακώθησαν ἀπὸ θλίψεως κακῶν καὶ ὀδύνης
40 ἐξεχύθη ἐξουδένωσις ἐ{P'} ἄρχοντας καὶ ἐπλάνησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἀβάτῳ καὶ οὐχ ὁδῷ
41 καὶ ἐβοήθησεν πένητι ἐκ πτωχείας καὶ ἔθετο ὡς πρόβατα πατριάς
42 ὄψονται εὐθεῖς καὶ εὐφρανθήσονται καὶ πᾶσα ἀνομία ἐμφράξει τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς
43 τίς σοφὸς καὶ φυλάξει ταῦτα καὶ συνήσουσιν τὰ ἐλέη τοῦ κυρίου
