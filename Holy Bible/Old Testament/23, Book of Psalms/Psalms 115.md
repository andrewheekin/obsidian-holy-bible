# Book of Psalms 115 (RSVCE)

### The Impotence of Idols and the Greatness of God
1 Not to us, OLord, not to us, but to thy name give glory, for the sake of thy steadfast love and thy faithfulness!
2 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
3 Our God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases.
4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
5 They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see.
6 They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell.
7 They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat.
8 Those who make them are like them; so are all who trust in them.
9 O Israel, trust in theLord! He is their help and their shield.
10 O house of Aaron, put your trust in theLord! He is their help and their shield.
11 You who fear theLord, trust in theLord! He is their help and their shield.
12 TheLordhas been mindful of us; he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron;
13 he will bless those who fear theLord, both small and great.
14 May theLordgive you increase, you and your children!
15 May you be blessed by theLord, who made heaven and earth!
16 The heavens are theLord’s heavens, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.
17 The dead do not praise theLord, nor do any that go down into silence.
18 But we will bless theLord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise theLord!
