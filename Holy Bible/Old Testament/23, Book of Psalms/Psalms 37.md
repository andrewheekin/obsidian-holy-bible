# Book of Psalms 37 (RSVCE)

### Exhortation to Patience and Trust
1 Fret not yourself because of the wicked, be not envious of wrongdoers!
2 For they will soon fade like the grass, and wither like the green herb.
3 Trust in theLord, and do good; so you will dwell in the land, and enjoy security.
4 Take delight in theLord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.
5 Commit your way to theLord; trust in him, and he will act.
6 He will bring forth your vindication as the light, and your right as the noonday.
7 Be still before theLord, and wait patiently for him; fret not yourself over him who prospers in his way, over the man who carries out evil devices!
8 Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath! Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.
9 For the wicked shall be cut off; but those who wait for theLordshall possess the land.
10 Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look well at his place, he will not be there.
11 But the meek shall possess the land, and delight themselves in abundant prosperity.
12 The wicked plots against the righteous, and gnashes his teeth at him;
13 but theLordlaughs at the wicked, for he sees that his day is coming.
14 The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows, to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those who walk uprightly;
15 their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
16 Better is a little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked.
17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but theLordupholds the righteous.
18 TheLordknows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will abide for ever;
19 they are not put to shame in evil times, in the days of famine they have abundance.
20 But the wicked perish; the enemies of theLordare like the glory of the pastures, they vanish—like smoke they vanish away.
21 The wicked borrows, and cannot pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives;
22 for those blessed by theLordshall possess the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off.
23 The steps of a man are from theLord, and he establishes him in whose way he delights;
24 though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for theLordis the stay of his hand.
25 I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging bread.
26 He is ever giving liberally and lending, and his children become a blessing.
27 Depart from evil, and do good; so shall you abide for ever.
28 For theLordloves justice; he will not forsake his saints. The righteous shall be preserved for ever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
29 The righteous shall possess the land, and dwell upon it for ever.
30 The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.
31 The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip.
32 The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him.
33 TheLordwill not abandon him to his power, or let him be condemned when he is brought to trial.
34 Wait for theLord, and keep to his way, and he will exalt you to possess the land; you will look on the destruction of the wicked.
35 I have seen a wicked man overbearing, and towering like a cedar of Lebanon.w
36 Again I passed by, and lo, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found.
37 Mark the blameless man, and behold the upright, for there is posterity for the man of peace.
38 But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed; the posterity of the wicked shall be cut off.
39 The salvation of the righteous is from theLord; he is their refuge in the time of trouble.
40 TheLordhelps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked, and saves them, because they take refuge in him.


# Liber Psalmorum 37 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Psalmus David, in rememorationem de sabbato.

2 Domine, ne in furore tuo arguas me,neque in ira tua corripias me:
3 quoniam sagittæ tuæ infixæ sunt mihi,et confirmasti super me manum tuam.
4 Non est sanitas in carne mea, a facie iræ tuæ;non est pax ossibus meis, a facie peccatorum meorum:
5 quoniam iniquitates meæ supergressæ sunt caput meum,et sicut onus grave gravatæ sunt super me.
6 Putruerunt et corruptæ sunt cicatrices meæ,a facie insipientiæ meæ.
7 Miser factus sum et curvatus sum usque in finem;tota die contristatus ingrediebar.
8 Quoniam lumbi mei impleti sunt illusionibus,et non est sanitas in carne mea.
9 Afflictus sum, et humiliatus sum nimis;rugiebam a gemitu cordis mei.
10 Domine, ante te omne desiderium meum,et gemitus meus a te non est absconditus.
11 Cor meum conturbatum est;dereliquit me virtus mea, et lumen oculorum meorum,et ipsum non est mecum.

12 Amici mei et proximi mei adversum me appropinquaverunt, et steterunt;et qui juxta me erant, de longe steterunt:et vim faciebant qui quærebant animam meam.
13 Et qui inquirebant mala mihi, locuti sunt vanitates,et dolos tota die meditabantur.
14 Ego autem, tamquam surdus, non audiebam;et sicut mutus non aperiens os suum.
15 Et factus sum sicut homo non audiens,et non habens in ore suo redargutiones.
16 Quoniam in te, Domine, speravi;tu exaudies me, Domine Deus meus.
17 Quia dixi: Nequando supergaudeant mihi inimici mei;et dum commoventur pedes mei, super me magna locuti sunt.
18 Quoniam ego in flagella paratus sum,et dolor meus in conspectu meo semper.
19 Quoniam iniquitatem meam annuntiabo,et cogitabo pro peccato meo.
20 Inimici autem mei vivunt, et confirmati sunt super me:et multiplicati sunt qui oderunt me inique.
21 Qui retribuunt mala pro bonis detrahebant mihi,quoniam sequebar bonitatem.
22 Ne derelinquas me, Domine Deus meus;ne discesseris a me.
23 Intende in adjutorium meum,Domine Deus salutis meæ.


# Ψαλμοί 37 (Septuagint)

1 ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυιδ εἰς ἀνάμνησιν περὶ σαββάτου

2 κύριε μὴ τῷ θυμῷ σου ἐλέγξῃς με μηδὲ τῇ ὀργῇ σου παιδεύσῃς με
3 ὅτι τὰ βέλη σου ἐνεπάγησάν μοι καὶ ἐπεστήρισας ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ τὴν χεῖρά σου
4 οὐκ ἔστιν ἴασις ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς ὀργῆς σου οὐκ ἔστιν εἰρήνη τοῖς ὀστέοις μου ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν μου
5 ὅτι αἱ ἀνομίαι μου ὑπερῆραν τὴν κεφαλήν μου ὡσεὶ φορτίον βαρὺ ἐβαρύνθησαν ἐ{P'} ἐμέ
6 προσώζεσαν καὶ ἐσάπησαν οἱ μώλωπές μου ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς ἀφροσύνης μου
7 ἐταλαιπώρησα καὶ κατεκάμφθην ἕως τέλους ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν σκυθρωπάζων ἐπορευόμην
8 ὅτι αἱ ψύαι μου ἐπλήσθησαν ἐμπαιγμῶν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἴασις ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου
9 ἐκακώθην καὶ ἐταπεινώθην ἕως σφόδρα ὠρυόμην ἀπὸ στεναγμοῦ τῆς καρδίας μου
10 κύριε ἐναντίον σου πᾶσα ἡ ἐπιθυμία μου καὶ ὁ στεναγμός μου ἀπὸ σοῦ οὐκ ἐκρύβη
11 ἡ καρδία μου ἐταράχθη ἐγκατέλιπέν με ἡ ἰσχύς μου καὶ τὸ φῶς τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου καὶ αὐτὸ οὐκ ἔστιν με{T'} ἐμοῦ

12 οἱ φίλοι μου καὶ οἱ πλησίον μου ἐξ ἐναντίας μου ἤγγισαν καὶ ἔστησαν καὶ οἱ ἔγγιστά μου ἀπὸ μακρόθεν ἔστησαν
13 καὶ ἐξεβιάσαντο οἱ ζητοῦντες τὴν ψυχήν μου καὶ οἱ ζητοῦντες τὰ κακά μοι ἐλάλησαν ματαιότητας καὶ δολιότητας ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐμελέτησαν
14 ἐγὼ δὲ ὡσεὶ κωφὸς οὐκ ἤκουον καὶ ὡσεὶ ἄλαλος οὐκ ἀνοίγων τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ ἐγενόμην ὡσεὶ ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἀκούων καὶ οὐκ ἔχων ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ ἐλεγμούς
16 ὅτι ἐπὶ σοί κύριε ἤλπισα σὺ εἰσακούσῃ κύριε ὁ θεός μου
17 ὅτι εἶπα μήποτε ἐπιχαρῶσίν μοι οἱ ἐχθροί μου καὶ ἐν τῷ σαλευθῆναι πόδας μου ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ ἐμεγαλορρημόνησαν
18 ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰς μάστιγας ἕτοιμος καὶ ἡ ἀλγηδών μου ἐνώπιόν μου διὰ παντός
19 ὅτι τὴν ἀνομίαν μου ἐγὼ ἀναγγελῶ καὶ μεριμνήσω ὑπὲρ τῆς ἁμαρτίας μου
20 οἱ δὲ ἐχθροί μου ζῶσιν καὶ κεκραταίωνται ὑπὲρ ἐμέ καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν οἱ μισοῦντές με ἀδίκως
21 οἱ ἀνταποδιδόντες κακὰ ἀντὶ ἀγαθῶν ἐνδιέβαλλόν με ἐπεὶ κατεδίωκον δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἀπέρριψάν με τὸν ἀγαπητὸν ὡσεὶ νεκρὸν ἐβδελυγμένον
22 μὴ ἐγκαταλίπῃς με κύριε ὁ θεός μου μὴ ἀποστῇς ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ
23 πρόσχες εἰς τὴν βοήθειάν μου κύριε τῆς σωτηρίας μου
