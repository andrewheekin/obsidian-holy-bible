# Book of Psalms 141 (RSVCE)

### Prayer for Preservation from Evil
1 I call upon thee, OLord; make haste to me! Give ear to my voice, when I call to thee!
2 Let my prayer be counted as incense before thee, and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice!
3 Set a guard over my mouth, OLord, keep watch over the door of my lips!
4 Incline not my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with men who work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties!
5 Let a good man strike or rebuke me in kindness, but let the oil of the wicked never anoint my head;c for my prayer is continuallydagainst their wicked deeds.
6 When they are given over to those who shall condemn them, then they shall learn that the word of theLordis true.
7 As a rock which one cleaves and shatters on the land, so shall their bones be strewn at the mouth of Sheol.e
8 But my eyes are toward thee, OLordGod; in thee I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless!
9 Keep me from the trap which they have laid for me, and from the snares of evildoers!
10 Let the wicked together fall into their own nets, while I escape.


# Liber Psalmorum 141 (Latin Vulgate)

 Intellectus David, cum esset in spelunca, oratio.

2 Voce mea ad Dominum clamavi,voce mea ad Dominum deprecatus sum.
3 Effundo in conspectu ejus orationem meam,et tribulationem meam ante ipsum pronuntio:
4 in deficiendo ex me spiritum meum,et tu cognovisti semitas meas.In via hac qua ambulabamabsconderunt laqueum mihi.
5 Considerabam ad dexteram, et videbam,et non erat qui cognosceret me:periit fuga a me,et non est qui requirat animam meam.
6 Clamavi ad te, Domine;dixi: Tu es spes mea,portio mea in terra viventium.
7 Intende ad deprecationem meam,quia humiliatus sum nimis.Libera me a persequentibus me,quia confortati sunt super me.
8 Educ de custodia animam meamad confitendum nomini tuo;me exspectant justi donec retribuas mihi.


# Ψαλμοί 141 (Septuagint)

 συνέσεως τῷ Δαυιδ ἐν τῷ εἶναι αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ προσευχή

2 φωνῇ μου πρὸς κύριον ἐκέκραξα φωνῇ μου πρὸς κύριον ἐδεήθην
3 ἐκχεῶ ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ τὴν δέησίν μου τὴν θλῖψίν μου ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ἀπαγγελῶ
4 ἐν τῷ ἐκλείπειν ἐξ ἐμοῦ τὸ πνεῦμά μου καὶ σὺ ἔγνως τὰς τρίβους μου ἐν ὁδῷ ταύτῃ ᾗ ἐπορευόμην ἔκρυψαν παγίδα μοι
5 κατενόουν εἰς τὰ δεξιὰ καὶ ἐπέβλεπον ὅτι οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐπιγινώσκων με ἀπώλετο φυγὴ ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ ἐκζητῶν τὴν ψυχήν μου
6 ἐκέκραξα πρὸς σέ κύριε εἶπα σὺ εἶ ἡ ἐλπίς μου μερίς μου ἐν γῇ ζώντων
7 πρόσχες πρὸς τὴν δέησίν μου ὅτι ἐταπεινώθην σφόδρα ῥῦσαί με ἐκ τῶν καταδιωκόντων με ὅτι ἐκραταιώθησαν ὑπὲρ ἐμέ
8 ἐξάγαγε ἐκ φυλακῆς τὴν ψυχήν μου τοῦ ἐξομολογήσασθαι τῷ ὀνόματί σου κύριε ἐμὲ ὑπομενοῦσιν δίκαιοι ἕως οὗ ἀνταποδῷς μοι
