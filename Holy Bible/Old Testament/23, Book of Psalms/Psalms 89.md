# Book of Psalms 89 (RSVCE)

### God’s Covenant with David
1 I will sing of thy steadfast love, OLord, for ever; with my mouth I will proclaim thy faithfulness to all generations.
2 For thy steadfast love was established for ever, thy faithfulness is firm as the heavens.
3 Thou hast said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant:
4 ‘I will establish your descendants for ever, and build your throne for all generations.’ ”Selah
5 Let the heavens praise thy wonders, OLord, thy faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones!
6 For who in the skies can be compared to theLord? Who among the heavenly beingszis like theLord,
7 a God feared in the council of the holy ones, great and terribleaabove all that are round about him?
8 OLordGod of hosts, who is mighty as thou art, OLord, with thy faithfulness round about thee?
9 Thou dost rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, thou stillest them.
10 Thou didst crush Rahab like a carcass, thou didst scatter thy enemies with thy mighty arm.
11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; the world and all that is in it, thou hast founded them.
12 The north and the south, thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise thy name.
13 Thou hast a mighty arm; strong is thy hand, high thy right hand.
14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before thee.
15 Blessed are the people who know the festal shout, who walk, OLord, in the light of thy countenance,
16 who exult in thy name all the day, and extolbthy righteousness.
17 For thou art the glory of their strength; by thy favor our horn is exalted.
18 For our shield belongs to theLord, our king to the Holy One of Israel.
19 Of old thou didst speak in a vision to thy faithful one, and say: “I have set the crowncupon one who is mighty, I have exalted one chosen from the people.
20 I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him;
21 so that my hand shall ever abide with him, my arm also shall strengthen him.
22 The enemy shall not outwit him, the wicked shall not humble him.
23 I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.
24 My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
25 I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers.
26 He shall cry to me, ‘Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.’
27 And I will make him the first-born, the highest of the kings of the earth.
28 My steadfast love I will keep for him for ever, and my covenant will stand firm for him.
29 I will establish his line for ever and his throne as the days of the heavens.
30 If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my ordinances,
31 if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments,
32 then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with scourges;
33 but I will not remove from him my steadfast love, or be false to my faithfulness.
34 I will not violate my covenant, or alter the word that went forth from my lips.
35 Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.
36 His line shall endure for ever, his throne as long as the sun before me.
37 Like the moon it shall be established for ever; it shall stand firm while the skies endure.”dSelah
38 But now thou hast cast off and rejected, thou art full of wrath against thy anointed.
39 Thou hast renounced the covenant with thy servant; thou hast defiled his crown in the dust.
40 Thou hast breached all his walls; thou hast laid his strongholds in ruins.
41 All that pass by despoil him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
42 Thou hast exalted the right hand of his foes; thou hast made all his enemies rejoice.
43 Yea, thou hast turned back the edge of his sword, and thou hast not made him stand in battle.
44 Thou hast removed the scepter from his hand, and cast his throne to the ground.
45 Thou hast cut short the days of his youth; thou hast covered him with shame.Selah
46 How long, OLord? Wilt thou hide thyself for ever? How long will thy wrath burn like fire?
47 Remember, O Lord, what the measure of life is, for what vanity thou hast created all the sons of men!
48 What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?Selah
49 Lord, where is thy steadfast love of old, which by thy faithfulness thou didst swear to David?
50 Remember, O Lord, how thy servant is scorned; how I bear in my bosom the insultsgof the peoples,
51 with which thy enemies taunt, OLord, with which they mock the footsteps of thy anointed.
52 Blessed be theLordfor ever! Amen and Amen.


# Liber Psalmorum 89 (Latin Vulgate)

 Oratio Moysi, hominis Dei.

1 Domine, refugium factus es nobisa generatione in generationem.
2 Priusquam montes fierent,aut formaretur terra et orbis,a sæculo et usque in sæculum tu es, Deus.
3 Ne avertas hominem in humilitatem:et dixisti: Convertimini, filii hominum.
4 Quoniam mille anni ante oculos tuostamquam dies hesterna quæ præteriit:et custodia in nocte
5 quæ pro nihilo habentur,eorum anni erunt.
6 Mane sicut herba transeat;mane floreat, et transeat;vespere decidat, induret, et arescat.
7 Quia defecimus in ira tua,et in furore tuo turbati sumus.
8 Posuisti iniquitates nostras in conspectu tuo;sæculum nostrum in illuminatione vultus tui.
9 Quoniam omnes dies nostri defecerunt,et in ira tua defecimus.Anni nostri sicut aranea meditabuntur;
10 dies annorum nostrorum in ipsis septuaginta anni.Si autem in potentatibus octoginta anni,et amplius eorum labor et dolor;quoniam supervenit mansuetudo, et corripiemur.
11 Quis novit potestatem iræ tuæ,et præ timore tuo iram tuam
12 dinumerare?Dexteram tuam sic notam fac,et eruditos corde in sapientia.

13 Convertere, Domine; usquequo?et deprecabilis esto super servos tuos.
14 Repleti sumus mane misericordia tua;et exsultavimus, et delectati sumus omnibus diebus nostris.
15 Lætati sumus pro diebus quibus nos humiliasti;annis quibus vidimus mala.
16 Respice in servos tuos et in opera tua,et dirige filios eorum.
17 Et sit splendor Domini Dei nostri super nos,et opera manuum nostrarum dirige super nos,et opus manuum nostrarum dirige.


# Ψαλμοί 89 (Septuagint)

1 προσευχὴ τοῦ Μωυσῆ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ θεοῦ κύριε καταφυγὴ ἐγενήθης ἡμῖν ἐν γενεᾷ καὶ γενεᾷ
2 πρὸ τοῦ ὄρη γενηθῆναι καὶ πλασθῆναι τὴν γῆν καὶ τὴν οἰκουμένην καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος σὺ εἶ
3 μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς ἄνθρωπον εἰς ταπείνωσιν καὶ εἶπας ἐπιστρέψατε υἱοὶ ἀνθρώπων
4 ὅτι χίλια ἔτη ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα ἡ ἐχθές ἥτις διῆλθεν καὶ φυλακὴ ἐν νυκτί
5 τὰ ἐξουδενώματα αὐτῶν ἔτη ἔσονται τὸ πρωὶ ὡσεὶ χλόη παρέλθοι
6 τὸ πρωὶ ἀνθήσαι καὶ παρέλθοι τὸ ἑσπέρας ἀποπέσοι σκληρυνθείη καὶ ξηρανθείη
7 ὅτι ἐξελίπομεν ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ σου καὶ ἐν τῷ θυμῷ σου ἐταράχθημεν
8 ἔθου τὰς ἀνομίας ἡμῶν ἐνώπιόν σου ὁ αἰὼν ἡμῶν εἰς φωτισμὸν τοῦ προσώπου σου
9 ὅτι πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι ἡμῶν ἐξέλιπον καὶ ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ σου ἐξελίπομεν τὰ ἔτη ἡμῶν ὡς ἀράχνην ἐμελέτων
10 αἱ ἡμέραι τῶν ἐτῶν ἡμῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτη ἐὰν δὲ ἐν δυναστείαις ὀγδοήκοντα ἔτη καὶ τὸ πλεῖον αὐτῶν κόπος καὶ πόνος ὅτι ἐπῆλθεν πραΰτης ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς καὶ παιδευθησόμεθα
11 τίς γινώσκει τὸ κράτος τῆς ὀργῆς σου καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου σου τὸν θυμόν σου
12 ἐξαριθμήσασθαι τὴν δεξιάν σου οὕτως γνώρισον καὶ τοὺς πεπεδημένους τῇ καρδίᾳ ἐν σοφίᾳ

13 ἐπίστρεψον κύριε ἕως πότε καὶ παρακλήθητι ἐπὶ τοῖς δούλοις σου
14 ἐνεπλήσθημεν τὸ πρωὶ τοῦ ἐλέους σου καὶ ἠγαλλιασάμεθα καὶ εὐφράνθημεν ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἡμέραις ἡμῶν
15 εὐφράνθημεν ἀν{Q'} ὧν ἡμερῶν ἐταπείνωσας ἡμᾶς ἐτῶν ὧν εἴδομεν κακά
16 καὶ ἰδὲ ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους σου καὶ τὰ ἔργα σου καὶ ὁδήγησον τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν
17 καὶ ἔστω ἡ λαμπρότης κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς καὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν ἡμῶν κατεύθυνον ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς
