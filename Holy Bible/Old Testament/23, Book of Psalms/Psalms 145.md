# Book of Psalms 145 (RSVCE)

### The Greatness and the Goodness of God
1 I will extol thee, my God and King, and bless thy name for ever and ever.
2 Every day I will bless thee, and praise thy name for ever and ever.
3 Great is theLord, and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable.
4 One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.
5 On the glorious splendor of thy majesty, and on thy wondrous works, I will meditate.
6 Men shall proclaim the might of thy terrible acts, and I will declare thy greatness.
7 They shall pour forth the fame of thy abundant goodness, and shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
8 TheLordis gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
9 TheLordis good to all, and his compassion is over all that he has made.
10 All thy works shall give thanks to thee, OLord, and all thy saints shall bless thee!
11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and tell of thy power,
12 to make known to the sons of men thy mighty deeds, and the glorious splendor of thylkingdom.
13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endures throughout all generations. TheLordis faithful in all his words, and gracious in all his deeds.m
14 TheLordupholds all who are falling, and raises up all who are bowed down.
15 The eyes of all look to thee, and thou givest them their food in due season.
16 Thou openest thy hand, thou satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
17 TheLordis just in all his ways, and kind in all his doings.
18 TheLordis near to all who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth.
19 He fulfils the desire of all who fear him, he also hears their cry, and saves them.
20 TheLordpreserves all who love him; but all the wicked he will destroy.
21 My mouth will speak the praise of theLord, and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.


# Liber Psalmorum 145 (Latin Vulgate)

 Alleluja, Aggæi et Zachariæ.

2 Lauda, anima mea, Dominum.Laudabo Dominum in vita mea;psallam Deo meo quamdiu fuero.Nolite confidere in principibus,
3 in filiis hominum, in quibus non est salus.
4 Exibit spiritus ejus, et revertetur in terram suam;in illa die peribunt omnes cogitationes eorum.
5 Beatus cujus Deus Jacob adjutor ejus,spes ejus in Domino Deo ipsius:
6 qui fecit cælum et terram,mare, et omnia quæ in eis sunt.
7 Qui custodit veritatem in sæculum;facit judicium injuriam patientibus;dat escam esurientibus.Dominus solvit compeditos;
8 Dominus illuminat cæcos.Dominus erigit elisos;Dominus diligit justos.
9 Dominus custodit advenas,pupillum et viduam suscipiet,et vias peccatorum disperdet.
10 Regnabit Dominus in sæcula;Deus tuus, Sion, in generationem et generationem.


# Ψαλμοί 145 (Septuagint)

 αλληλουια Αγγαιου καὶ Ζαχαριου αἴνει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν κύριον

2 αἰνέσω κύριον ἐν ζωῇ μου ψαλῶ τῷ θεῷ μου ἕως ὑπάρχω
3 μὴ πεποίθατε ἐ{P'} ἄρχοντας καὶ ἐ{F'} υἱοὺς ἀνθρώπων οἷς οὐκ ἔστιν σωτηρία
4 ἐξελεύσεται τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπιστρέψει εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀπολοῦνται πάντες οἱ διαλογισμοὶ αὐτῶν
5 μακάριος οὗ ὁ θεὸς Ιακωβ βοηθός ἡ ἐλπὶς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ κύριον τὸν θεὸν αὐτοῦ
6 τὸν ποιήσαντα τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸν φυλάσσοντα ἀλήθειαν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
7 ποιοῦντα κρίμα τοῖς ἀδικουμένοις διδόντα τροφὴν τοῖς πεινῶσιν κύριος λύει πεπεδημένους
8 κύριος ἀνορθοῖ κατερραγμένους κύριος σοφοῖ τυφλούς κύριος ἀγαπᾷ δικαίους
9 κύριος φυλάσσει τοὺς προσηλύτους ὀρφανὸν καὶ χήραν ἀναλήμψεται καὶ ὁδὸν ἁμαρτωλῶν ἀφανιεῖ
10 βασιλεύσει κύριος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ὁ θεός σου Σιων εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν
