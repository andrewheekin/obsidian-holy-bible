# Book of Psalms 122 (RSVCE)

### Song of Praise and Prayer for Jerusalem
1 I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of theLord!”
2 Our feet have been standing within your gates, O Jerusalem!
3 Jerusalem, built as a city which is bound firmly together,
4 to which the tribes go up, the tribes of theLord, as was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of theLord.
5 There thrones for judgment were set, the thrones of the house of David.
6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! “May they prosper who love you!
7 Peace be within your walls, and security within your towers!”
8 For my brethren and companions’ sake I will say, “Peace be within you!”
9 For the sake of the house of theLordour God, I will seek your good.


# Liber Psalmorum 122 (Latin Vulgate)

 Canticum graduum.

1 Ad te levavi oculos meos,qui habitas in cælis.
2 Ecce sicut oculi servorumin manibus dominorum suorum;sicut oculi ancillæin manibus dominæ suæ:ita oculi nostri ad Dominum Deum nostrum,donec misereatur nostri.
3 Miserere nostri, Domine, miserere nostri,quia multum repleti sumus despectione;
4 quia multum repleta est anima nostraopprobrium abundantibus, et despectio superbis.


# Ψαλμοί 122 (Septuagint)

1 ᾠδὴ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν πρὸς σὲ ἦρα τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου τὸν κατοικοῦντα ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ
2 ἰδοὺ ὡς ὀφθαλμοὶ δούλων εἰς χεῖρας τῶν κυρίων αὐτῶν ὡς ὀφθαλμοὶ παιδίσκης εἰς χεῖρας τῆς κυρίας αὐτῆς οὕτως οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν πρὸς κύριον τὸν θεὸν ἡμῶν ἕως οὗ οἰκτιρήσαι ἡμᾶς
3 ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς κύριε ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς ὅτι ἐπὶ πολὺ ἐπλήσθημεν ἐξουδενώσεως
4 ἐπὶ πλεῖον ἐπλήσθη ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν τὸ ὄνειδος τοῖς εὐθηνοῦσιν καὶ ἡ ἐξουδένωσις τοῖς ὑπερηφάνοις
