### The Foolishness of Nature Worship
1 For all men who were ignorant of God were foolish by nature; and they were unable from the good things that are seen to know him who exists, nor did they recognize the craftsman while paying heed to his works;
2 but they supposed that either fire or wind or swift air, or the circle of the stars, or turbulent water, or the luminaries of heaven were the gods that rule the world.
3 If through delight in the beauty of these things men assumed them to be gods, let them know how much better than these is their Lord, for the author of beauty created them.
4 And if men were amazed at their power and working, let them perceive from them how much more powerful is he who formed them.
5 For from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator.
6 Yet these men are little to be blamed, for perhaps they go astray while seeking God and desiring to find him.
7 For as they live among his works they keep searching, and they trust in what they see, because the things that are seen are beautiful.
8 Yet again, not even they are to be excused;
9 for if they had the power to know so much that they could investigate the world, how did they fail to find sooner the Lord of these things?
### The Foolishness of Idolatry
10 But miserable, with their hopes set on dead things, are the men who give the name “gods” to the works of men’s hands, gold and silver fashioned with skill, and likenesses of animals, or a useless stone, the work of an ancient hand.
11 A skilled woodcutter may saw down a tree easy to handle and skilfully strip off all its bark, and then with pleasing workmanship make a useful vessel that serves life’s needs,
12 and burn the castoff pieces of his work to prepare his food, and eat his fill.
13 But a castoff piece from among them, useful for nothing, a stick crooked and full of knots, he takes and carves with care in his leisure, and shapes it with skill gained in idleness;t he forms it like the image of a man,
14 or makes it like some worthless animal, giving it a coat of red paint and coloring its surface red and covering every blemish in it with paint;
15 then he makes for it a niche that befits it, and sets it in the wall, and fastens it there with iron.
16 So he takes thought for it, that it may not fall, because he knows that it cannot help itself, for it is only an image and has need of help.
17 When he prays about possessions and his marriage and children, he is not ashamed to address a lifeless thing.
18 For health he appeals to a thing that is weak; for life he prays to a thing that is dead; for aid he entreats a thing that is utterly inexperienced; for a prosperous journey, a thing that cannot take a step;
19 for money-making and work and success with his hands he asks strength of a thing whose hands have no strength.


# Liber Sapientiae 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Vani autem sunt omnes hominesin quibus non subest scientia Dei;et de his quæ videntur bona,non potuerunt intelligere eum qui est,neque operibus attendentes agnoverunt quis esset artifex:
2 sed aut ignem, aut spiritum, aut citatum aërem,aut gyrum stellarum, aut nimiam aquam, aut solem et lunam,rectores orbis terrarum deos putaverunt.
3 Quorum si specie delectati, deos putaverunt,sciant quanto his dominator eorum speciosior est:speciei enim generator hæc omnia constituit.
4 Aut si virtutem et opera eorum mirati sunt,intelligant ab illis quoniam qui hæc fecit fortior est illis:
5 a magnitudine enim speciei et creaturæcognoscibiliter poterit creator horum videri.

6 Sed tamen adhuc in his minor est querela;et hi enim fortasse errant,Deum quærentes, et volentes invenire.
7 Etenim cum in operibus illius conversentur inquirunt,et persuasum habent quoniam bona sunt quæ videntur.
8 Iterum autem nec his debet ignosci.
9 Si enim tantum potuerunt scireut possent æstimare sæculum,quomodo hujus Dominum non facilius invenerunt?
10 Infelices autem sunt,et inter mortuos spes illorum est,qui appellaverunt deos opera manuum hominum:aurum et argentum, artis inventionem,et similitudines animalium, aut lapidem inutilem,opus manus antiquæ.

11 Aut si quis artifex faber de silva lignum rectum secuerit,et hujus docte eradat omnem corticem,et arte sua ususdiligenter fabricet vas utile in conversationem vitæ;
12 reliquiis autem ejus operisad præparationem escæ abutatur,
13 et reliquum horum quod ad nullos usus facit,lignum curvum et vorticibus plenumsculpat diligenter per vacuitatem suam,et per scientiam suæ artis figuret illud,et assimilet illud imagini hominis,
14 aut alicui ex animalibus illud comparet:perliniens rubrica, et rubicundum faciens fuco colorem illius,et omnem maculam quæ in illo est perliniens;
15 et faciat ei dignam habitationem,et in pariete ponens illud,et confirmans ferro
16 ne forte cadat,prospiciens illi:sciens quoniam non potest adjuvare se:imago enim est, et opus est illi adjutorium.

17 Et de substantia sua, et de filiis suis,et de nuptiis votum faciens inquirit:non erubescit loqui cum illo qui sine anima est.
18 Et pro sanitate quidem infirmum deprecatur,et pro vita rogat mortuum,et in adjutorium inutilem invocat.
19 Et pro itinere petit ab eo qui ambulare non potest;et de acquirendo, et de operando,et de omnium rerum eventu,petit ab eo qui in omnibus est inutilis.


# Σοφία Σαλoμῶντος 13 (Septuagint)

1 μάταιοι μὲν γὰρ πάντες ἄνθρωποι φύσει οἷς παρῆν θεοῦ ἀγνωσία καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὁρωμένων ἀγαθῶν οὐκ ἴσχυσαν εἰδέναι τὸν ὄντα οὔτε τοῖς ἔργοις προσέχοντες ἐπέγνωσαν τὸν τεχνίτην
2 ἀλ{L'} ἢ πῦρ ἢ πνεῦμα ἢ ταχινὸν ἀέρα ἢ κύκλον ἄστρων ἢ βίαιον ὕδωρ ἢ φωστῆρας οὐρανοῦ πρυτάνεις κόσμου θεοὺς ἐνόμισαν
3 ὧν εἰ μὲν τῇ καλλονῇ τερπόμενοι ταῦτα θεοὺς ὑπελάμβανον γνώτωσαν πόσῳ τούτων ὁ δεσπότης ἐστὶ βελτίων ὁ γὰρ τοῦ κάλλους γενεσιάρχης ἔκτισεν αὐτά
4 εἰ δὲ δύναμιν καὶ ἐνέργειαν ἐκπλαγέντες νοησάτωσαν ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν πόσῳ ὁ κατασκευάσας αὐτὰ δυνατώτερός ἐστιν
5 ἐκ γὰρ μεγέθους καὶ καλλονῆς κτισμάτων ἀναλόγως ὁ γενεσιουργὸς αὐτῶν θεωρεῖται

6 ἀλ{L'} ὅμως ἐπὶ τούτοις μέμψις ἐστὶν ὀλίγη καὶ γὰρ αὐτοὶ τάχα πλανῶνται θεὸν ζητοῦντες καὶ θέλοντες εὑρεῖν
7 ἐν γὰρ τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ ἀναστρεφόμενοι διερευνῶσιν καὶ πείθονται τῇ ὄψει ὅτι καλὰ τὰ βλεπόμενα
8 πάλιν {D'} οὐ{D'} αὐτοὶ συγγνωστοί
9 εἰ γὰρ τοσοῦτον ἴσχυσαν εἰδέναι ἵνα δύνωνται στοχάσασθαι τὸν αἰῶνα τὸν τούτων δεσπότην πῶς τάχιον οὐχ εὗρον
10 ταλαίπωροι δὲ καὶ ἐν νεκροῖς αἱ ἐλπίδες αὐτῶν οἵτινες ἐκάλεσαν θεοὺς ἔργα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων χρυσὸν καὶ ἄργυρον τέχνης ἐμμελέτημα καὶ ἀπεικάσματα ζῴων ἢ λίθον ἄχρηστον χειρὸς ἔργον ἀρχαίας

11 εἰ δὲ καί τις ὑλοτόμος τέκτων εὐκίνητον φυτὸν ἐκπρίσας περιέξυσεν εὐμαθῶς πάντα τὸν φλοιὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ τεχνησάμενος εὐπρεπῶς κατεσκεύασεν χρήσιμον σκεῦος εἰς ὑπηρεσίαν ζωῆς
12 τὰ δὲ ἀποβλήματα τῆς ἐργασίας εἰς ἑτοιμασίαν τροφῆς ἀναλώσας ἐνεπλήσθη
13 τὸ δὲ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀπόβλημα εἰς οὐθὲν εὔχρηστον ξύλον σκολιὸν καὶ ὄζοις συμπεφυκός λαβὼν ἔγλυψεν ἐν ἐπιμελείᾳ ἀργίας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐμπειρίᾳ συνέσεως ἐτύπωσεν αὐτό ἀπείκασεν αὐτὸ εἰκόνι ἀνθρώπου
14 ἢ ζῴῳ τινὶ εὐτελεῖ ὡμοίωσεν αὐτὸ καταχρίσας μίλτῳ καὶ φύκει ἐρυθήνας χρόαν αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσαν κηλῖδα τὴν ἐν αὐτῷ καταχρίσας
15 καὶ ποιήσας αὐτῷ αὐτοῦ ἄξιον οἴκημα ἐν τοίχῳ ἔθηκεν αὐτὸ ἀσφαλισάμενος σιδήρῳ
16 ἵνα μὲν οὖν μὴ καταπέσῃ προενόησεν αὐτοῦ εἰδὼς ὅτι ἀδυνατεῖ ἑαυτῷ βοηθῆσαι καὶ γάρ ἐστιν εἰκὼν καὶ χρείαν ἔχει βοηθείας

17 περὶ δὲ κτημάτων καὶ γάμων αὐτοῦ καὶ τέκνων προσευχόμενος οὐκ αἰσχύνεται τῷ ἀψύχῳ προσλαλῶν καὶ περὶ μὲν ὑγιείας τὸ ἀσθενὲς ἐπικαλεῖται
18 περὶ δὲ ζωῆς τὸ νεκρὸν ἀξιοῖ περὶ δὲ ἐπικουρίας τὸ ἀπειρότατον ἱκετεύει περὶ δὲ ὁδοιπορίας τὸ μηδὲ βάσει χρῆσθαι δυνάμενον
19 περὶ δὲ πορισμοῦ καὶ ἐργασίας καὶ χειρῶν ἐπιτυχίας τὸ ἀδρανέστατον ταῖς χερσὶν εὐδράνειαν αἰτεῖται
