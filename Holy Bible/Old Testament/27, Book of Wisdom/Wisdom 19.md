### The Red Sea
1 But the ungodly were assailed to the end by pitiless anger, for Godvknew in advance even their future actions,
2 that, though they themselves had permitted thy people to depart and hastily sent them forth, they would change their minds and pursue them.
3 For while they were still busy at mourning, and were lamenting at the graves of their dead, they reached another foolish decision, and pursued as fugitives those whom they had begged and compelled to depart.
4 For the fate they deserved drew them on to this end, and made them forget what had happened, in order that they might fill up the punishment which their torments still lacked,
5 and that thy people might experience an incredible journey, but they themselves might meet a strange death.
### God Guides and Protects His People
6 For the whole creation in its nature was fashioned anew, complying with thy commands, that thy childrenymight be kept unharmed.
7 The cloud was seen overshadowing the camp, and dry land emerging where water had stood before, an unhindered way out of the Red Sea, and a grassy plain out of the raging waves,
8 where those protected by thy hand passed through as one nation, after gazing on marvelous wonders.
9 For they ranged like horses, and leaped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who didst deliver them.
10 For they still recalled the events of their sojourn, how instead of producing animals the earth brought forth gnats, and instead of fish the river spewed out vast numbers of frogs.
11 Afterward they saw also a new kind of birds, when desire led them to ask for luxurious food;
12 for, to give them relief, quails came up from the sea.
### The Punishment of the Egyptians
13 The punishments did not come upon the sinners without prior signs in the violence of thunder, for they justly suffered because of their wicked acts; for they practiced a more bitter hatred of strangers.
14 Others had refused to receive strangers when they came to them, but these made slaves of guests who were their benefactors.
15 And not only so, but punishment of some sort will come upon the former for their hostile reception of the aliens;
16 but the latter, after receiving them with festal celebrations, afflicted with terrible sufferings those who had already shared the same rights.
17 They were stricken also with loss of sight— just as were those at the door of the righteous man— when, surrounded by yawning darkness, each tried to find the way through his own door.
### A New Harmony in Nature
18 For the elements changed places with one another, as on a harp the notes vary the nature of the rhythm, while each note remains the same.b This may be clearly inferred from the sight of what took place.
19 For land animals were transformed into water creatures, and creatures that swim moved over to the land.
20 Fire even in water retained its normal power, and water forgot its fire-quenching nature.
21 Flames, on the contrary, failed to consume the flesh of perishable creatures that walked among them, nor did they meltcthe crystalline, easily melted kind of heavenly food.
### Conclusion
22 For in everything, O Lord, thou hast exalted and glorified thy people; and thou hast not neglected to help them at all times and in all places.


# Liber Sapientiae 19 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Impiis autem usque in novissimumsine misericordia ira supervenit.Præsciebat enim et futura illorum:
2 quoniam cum ipsi permisissent ut se educerent,et cum magna sollicitudine præmisissent illos,consequebantur illos, pœnitentia acti.
3 Adhuc enim inter manus habentes luctum,et deplorantes ad monumenta mortuorum,aliam sibi assumpserunt cogitationem inscientiæ,et quos rogantes projecerant,hos tamquam fugitivos persequebantur.
4 Ducebat enim illos ad hunc finem digna necessitas;et horum quæ acciderant commemorationem amittebant,ut quæ deerant tormentis repleret punitio:
5 et populus quidem tuus mirabiliter transiret,illi autem novam mortem invenirent.

6 Omnis enim creatura ad suum genus ab initio refigurabatur,deserviens tuis præceptis,ut pueri tui custodirentur illæsi.
7 Nam nubes castra eorum obumbrabat,et ex aqua quæ ante erat, terra arida apparuit,et in mari Rubro via sine impedimento,et campus germinans de profundo nimio:
8 per quem omnis natio transivit quæ tegebatur tua manu,videntes tua mirabilia et monstra.
9 Tamquam enim equi depaverunt escam,et tamquam agni exsultaverunt,magnificantes te, Domine, qui liberasti illos.
10 Memores enim erant adhuc eorumquæ in incolatu illorum facta fuerant:quemadmodum pro natione animalium eduxit terra muscas,et pro piscibus eructavit fluvius multitudinem ranarum.
11 Novissime autem viderunt novam creaturam avium,cum, adducti concupiscentia, postulaverunt escas epulationis.
12 In allocutione enim desiderii ascendit illis de mari ortygometra:
13 et vexationes peccatoribus supervenerunt,non sine illis quæ ante facta erant argumentis per vim fulminum:juste enim patiebantur secundum suas nequitias.
14 Etenim detestabiliorem inhospitalitatem instituerunt:alii quidem ignotos non recipiebant advenas;alii autem bonos hospites in servitutem redigebant.
15 Et non solum hæc, sed et alius quidam respectus illorum erat,quoniam inviti recipiebant extraneos.
16 Qui autem cum lætitia receperunt hosqui eisdem usi erant justitiis,sævissimis afflixerunt doloribus.

17 Percussi sunt autem cæcitate:sicut illi in foribus justi,cum subitaneis cooperti essent tenebris,unusquisque transitum ostii sui quærebat.
18 In se enim elementa dum convertuntur,sicut in organo qualitatis sonus immutatur,et omnia suum sonum custodiunt:unde æstimari ex ipso visu certo potest.
19 Agrestia enim in aquatica convertebantur,et quæcumque erant natantia, in terram transibant.
20 Ignis in aqua valebat supra suam virtutem,et aqua extinguentis naturæ obliviscebatur.


# Σοφία Σαλoμῶντος 19 (Septuagint)

1 τοῖς δὲ ἀσεβέσιν μέχρι τέλους ἀνελεήμων θυμὸς ἐπέστη προῄδει γὰρ αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ μέλλοντα
2 ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἐπιτρέψαντες τοῦ ἀπιέναι καὶ μετὰ σπουδῆς προπέμψαντες αὐτοὺς διώξουσιν μεταμεληθέντες
3 ἔτι γὰρ ἐν χερσὶν ἔχοντες τὰ πένθη καὶ προσοδυρόμενοι τάφοις νεκρῶν ἕτερον ἐπεσπάσαντο λογισμὸν ἀνοίας καὶ οὓς ἱκετεύοντες ἐξέβαλον τούτους ὡς φυγάδας ἐδίωκον
4 εἷλκεν γὰρ αὐτοὺς ἡ ἀξία ἐπὶ τοῦτο τὸ πέρας ἀνάγκη καὶ τῶν συμβεβηκότων ἀμνηστίαν ἐνέβαλεν ἵνα τὴν λείπουσαν ταῖς βασάνοις προσαναπληρώσωσιν κόλασιν
5 καὶ ὁ μὲν λαός σου παράδοξον ὁδοιπορίαν πειράσῃ ἐκεῖνοι δὲ ξένον εὕρωσι θάνατον

6 ὅλη γὰρ ἡ κτίσις ἐν ἰδίῳ γένει πάλιν ἄνωθεν διετυποῦτο ὑπηρετοῦσα ταῖς σαῖς ἐπιταγαῖς ἵνα οἱ σοὶ παῖδες φυλαχθῶσιν ἀβλαβεῖς
7 ἡ τὴν παρεμβολὴν σκιάζουσα νεφέλη ἐκ δὲ προϋφεστῶτος ὕδατος ξηρᾶς ἀνάδυσις γῆς ἐθεωρήθη ἐξ ἐρυθρᾶς θαλάσσης ὁδὸς ἀνεμπόδιστος καὶ χλοηφόρον πεδίον ἐκ κλύδωνος βιαίου
8 δ{I'} οὗ πανεθνεὶ διῆλθον οἱ τῇ σῇ σκεπαζόμενοι χειρὶ θεωρήσαντες θαυμαστὰ τέρατα
9 ὡς γὰρ ἵπποι ἐνεμήθησαν καὶ ὡς ἀμνοὶ διεσκίρτησαν αἰνοῦντές σε κύριε τὸν ῥυσάμενον αὐτούς
10 ἐμέμνηντο γὰρ ἔτι τῶν ἐν τῇ παροικίᾳ αὐτῶν πῶς ἀντὶ μὲν γενέσεως ζῴων ἐξήγαγεν ἡ γῆ σκνῖπα ἀντὶ δὲ ἐνύδρων ἐξηρεύξατο ὁ ποταμὸς πλῆθος βατράχων
11 ἐ{F'} ὑστέρῳ δὲ εἶδον καὶ γένεσιν νέαν ὀρνέων ὅτε ἐπιθυμίᾳ προαχθέντες ᾐτήσαντο ἐδέσματα τρυφῆς
12 εἰς γὰρ παραμυθίαν ἐκ θαλάσσης ἀνέβη αὐτοῖς ὀρτυγομήτρα
13 καὶ αἱ τιμωρίαι τοῖς ἁμαρτωλοῖς ἐπῆλθον οὐκ ἄνευ τῶν προγεγονότων τεκμηρίων τῇ βίᾳ τῶν κεραυνῶν δικαίως γὰρ ἔπασχον ταῖς ἰδίαις αὐτῶν πονηρίαις
14 καὶ γὰρ χαλεπωτέραν μισοξενίαν ἐπετήδευσαν οἱ μὲν γὰρ τοὺς ἀγνοοῦντας οὐκ ἐδέχοντο παρόντας οὗτοι δὲ εὐεργέτας ξένους ἐδουλοῦντο
15 καὶ οὐ μόνον ἀλ{L'} ἤ τις ἐπισκοπὴ ἔσται αὐτῶν ἐπεὶ ἀπεχθῶς προσεδέχοντο τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους
16 οἱ δὲ μετὰ ἑορτασμάτων εἰσδεξάμενοι τοὺς ἤδη τῶν αὐτῶν μετεσχηκότας δικαίων δεινοῖς ἐκάκωσαν πόνοις

17 ἐπλήγησαν δὲ καὶ ἀορασίᾳ ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνοι ἐπὶ ταῖς τοῦ δικαίου θύραις ὅτε ἀχανεῖ περιβληθέντες σκότει ἕκαστος τῶν ἑαυτοῦ θυρῶν τὴν δίοδον ἐζήτει
18 δ{I'} ἑαυτῶν γὰρ τὰ στοιχεῖα μεθαρμοζόμενα ὥσπερ ἐν ψαλτηρίῳ φθόγγοι τοῦ ῥυθμοῦ τὸ ὄνομα διαλλάσσουσιν πάντοτε μένοντα ἤχῳ ὅπερ ἐστὶν εἰκάσαι ἐκ τῆς τῶν γεγονότων ὄψεως ἀκριβῶς
19 χερσαῖα γὰρ εἰς ἔνυδρα μετεβάλλετο καὶ νηκτὰ μετέβαινεν ἐπὶ γῆς
20 πῦρ ἴσχυεν ἐν ὕδατι τῆς ἰδίας δυνάμεως καὶ ὕδωρ τῆς σβεστικῆς φύσεως ἐπελανθάνετο
