# Book of Wisdom 3 (RSVCE)

### The Destiny of the Righteous
1 But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them.
2 In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, and their departure was thought to be an affliction,
3 and their going from us to be their destruction; but they are at peace.
4 For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope is full of immortality.
5 Having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good, because God tested them and found them worthy of himself;
6 like gold in the furnace he tried them, and like a sacrificial burnt offering he accepted them.
7 In the time of their visitation they will shine forth, and will run like sparks through the stubble.
8 They will govern nations and rule over peoples, and the Lord will reign over them for ever.
9 Those who trust in him will understand truth, and the faithful will abide with him in love, because grace and mercy are upon his elect, and he watches over his holy ones.g
### The Destiny of the Ungodly
10 But the ungodly will be punished as their reasoning deserves, who disregarded the righteous manhand rebelled against the Lord;
11 for whoever despises wisdom and instruction is miserable. Their hope is vain, their labors are unprofitable, and their works are useless.
12 Their wives are foolish, and their children evil;
### On Childlessness
13 their offspring are accursed. For blessed is the barren woman who is undefiled, who has not entered into a sinful union; she will have fruit when God examines souls.
14 Blessed also is the eunuch whose hands have done no lawless deed, and who has not devised wicked things against the Lord; for special favor will be shown him for his faithfulness, and a place of great delight in the temple of the Lord.
15 For the fruit of good labors is renowned, and the root of understanding does not fail.
16 But children of adulterers will not come to maturity, and the offspring of an unlawful union will perish.
17 Even if they live long they will be held of no account, and finally their old age will be without honor.
18 If they die young, they will have no hope and no consolation in the day of decision.
19 For the end of an unrighteous generation is grievous.


# Liber Sapientiae 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Justorum autem animæ in manu Dei sunt,et non tangent illos tormentum mortis.
2 Visi sunt oculis insipientium mori,et æstimata est afflictio exitus illorum,
3 et quod a nobis est iter exterminium;illi autem sunt in pace:
4 etsi coram hominibus tormenta passi sunt,spes illorum immortalitate plena est.
5 In paucis vexati sunt, in multis bene disponentur,quoniam Deus tentavit eos,et invenit illos dignos se.
6 Tamquam aurum in fornace probavit illos,et quasi holocausti hostiam accepit illos,et in tempore erit respectus illorum.
7 Fulgebunt justiet tamquam scintillæ in arundineto discurrent.
8 Judicabunt nationes, et dominabuntur populis,et regnabit Dominus illorum in perpetuum.
9 Qui confidunt in illo intelligent veritatem,et fideles in dilectione acquiescent illi,quoniam donum et pax est electis ejus.

10 Impii autem secundum quæ cogitaveruntcorreptionem habebunt:qui neglexerunt justum,et a Domino recesserunt.
11 Sapientiam enim et disciplinam qui abjicit infelix est:et vacua est spes illorum,et labores sine fructu,et inutilia opera eorum.
12 Mulieres eorum insensatæ sunt,et nequissimi filii eorum.
13 Maledicta creatura eorum, quoniam felix est sterilis;et incoinquinata, quæ nescivit thorum in delicto,habebit fructum in respectione animarum sanctarum;
14 et spado qui non operatus est per manus suas iniquitatem,nec cogitavit adversus Deum nequissima:dabitur enim illi fidei donum electum,et sors in templo Dei acceptissima.
15 Bonorum enim laborum gloriosus est fructus,et quæ non concidat radix sapientiæ.
16 Filii autem adulterorum in inconsummatione erunt,et ab iniquo thoro semen exterminabitur.
17 Et si quidem longæ vitæ erunt, in nihilum computabuntur,et sine honore erit novissima senectus illorum:
18 et si celerius defuncti fuerint, non habebunt spem,nec in die agnitionis allocutionem.
19 Nationis enim iniquæ diræ sunt consummationes.


# Σοφία Σαλoμῶντος 3 (Septuagint)

1 δικαίων δὲ ψυχαὶ ἐν χειρὶ θεοῦ καὶ οὐ μὴ ἅψηται αὐτῶν βάσανος
2 ἔδοξαν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ἀφρόνων τεθνάναι καὶ ἐλογίσθη κάκωσις ἡ ἔξοδος αὐτῶν
3 καὶ ἡ ἀ{F'} ἡμῶν πορεία σύντριμμα οἱ δέ εἰσιν ἐν εἰρήνῃ
4 καὶ γὰρ ἐν ὄψει ἀνθρώπων ἐὰν κολασθῶσιν ἡ ἐλπὶς αὐτῶν ἀθανασίας πλήρης
5 καὶ ὀλίγα παιδευθέντες μεγάλα εὐεργετηθήσονται ὅτι ὁ θεὸς ἐπείρασεν αὐτοὺς καὶ εὗρεν αὐτοὺς ἀξίους ἑαυτοῦ
6 ὡς χρυσὸν ἐν χωνευτηρίῳ ἐδοκίμασεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ὡς ὁλοκάρπωμα θυσίας προσεδέξατο αὐτούς
7 καὶ ἐν καιρῷ ἐπισκοπῆς αὐτῶν ἀναλάμψουσιν καὶ ὡς σπινθῆρες ἐν καλάμῃ διαδραμοῦνται
8 κρινοῦσιν ἔθνη καὶ κρατήσουσιν λαῶν καὶ βασιλεύσει αὐτῶν κύριος εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας
9 οἱ πεποιθότες ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ συνήσουσιν ἀλήθειαν καὶ οἱ πιστοὶ ἐν ἀγάπῃ προσμενοῦσιν αὐτῷ ὅτι χάρις καὶ ἔλεος τοῖς ἐκλεκτοῖς αὐτοῦ

10 οἱ δὲ ἀσεβεῖς καθὰ ἐλογίσαντο ἕξουσιν ἐπιτιμίαν οἱ ἀμελήσαντες τοῦ δικαίου καὶ τοῦ κυρίου ἀποστάντες
11 σοφίαν γὰρ καὶ παιδείαν ὁ ἐξουθενῶν ταλαίπωρος καὶ κενὴ ἡ ἐλπὶς αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ κόποι ἀνόνητοι καὶ ἄχρηστα τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν
12 αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν ἄφρονες καὶ πονηρὰ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν ἐπικατάρατος ἡ γένεσις αὐτῶν
13 ὅτι μακαρία στεῖρα ἡ ἀμίαντος ἥτις οὐκ ἔγνω κοίτην ἐν παραπτώματι ἕξει καρπὸν ἐν ἐπισκοπῇ ψυχῶν
14 καὶ εὐνοῦχος ὁ μὴ ἐργασάμενος ἐν χειρὶ ἀνόμημα μηδὲ ἐνθυμηθεὶς κατὰ τοῦ κυρίου πονηρά δοθήσεται γὰρ αὐτῷ τῆς πίστεως χάρις ἐκλεκτὴ καὶ κλῆρος ἐν ναῷ κυρίου θυμηρέστερος
15 ἀγαθῶν γὰρ πόνων καρπὸς εὐκλεής καὶ ἀδιάπτωτος ἡ ῥίζα τῆς φρονήσεως
16 τέκνα δὲ μοιχῶν ἀτέλεστα ἔσται καὶ ἐκ παρανόμου κοίτης σπέρμα ἀφανισθήσεται
17 ἐάν τε γὰρ μακρόβιοι γένωνται εἰς οὐθὲν λογισθήσονται καὶ ἄτιμον ἐ{P'} ἐσχάτων τὸ γῆρας αὐτῶν
18 ἐάν τε ὀξέως τελευτήσωσιν οὐχ ἕξουσιν ἐλπίδα οὐδὲ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ διαγνώσεως παραμύθιον
19 γενεᾶς γὰρ ἀδίκου χαλεπὰ τὰ τέλη
