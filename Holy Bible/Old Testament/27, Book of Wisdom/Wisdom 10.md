# Book of Wisdom 10 (RSVCE)

### The Work of Wisdom from Adam to Moses
1 Wisdom protected the first-formed father of the world, when he alone had been created; she delivered him from his transgression,
2 and gave him strength to rule all things.
3 But when an unrighteous man departed from her in his anger, he perished because in rage he slew his brother.
4 When the earth was flooded because of him, wisdom again saved it, steering the righteous man by a paltry piece of wood.
5 Wisdom also, when the nations in wicked agreement had been confounded, recognized the righteous man and preserved him blameless before God, and kept him strong in the face of his compassion for his child.
6 Wisdom rescued a righteous man when the ungodly were perishing; he escaped the fire that descended on the Five Cities.y
7 Evidence of their wickedness still remains: a continually smoking wasteland, plants bearing fruit that does not ripen, and a pillar of salt standing as a monument to an unbelieving soul.
8 For because they passed wisdom by, they not only were hindered from recognizing the good, but also left for mankind a reminder of their folly, so that their failures could never go unnoticed.
9 Wisdom rescued from troubles those who served her.
10 When a righteous man fled from his brother’s wrath, she guided him on straight paths; she showed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of angels;z she prospered him in his labors, and increased the fruit of his toil.
11 When his oppressors were covetous, she stood by him and made him rich.
12 She protected him from his enemies, and kept him safe from those who lay in wait for him; in his arduous contest she gave him the victory, so that he might learn that godliness is more powerful than anything.
13 When a righteous man was sold, wisdom did not desert him, but delivered him from sin. She descended with him into the dungeon,
14 and when he was in prison she did not leave him, until she brought him the scepter of a kingdom and authority over his masters. Those who accused him she showed to be false, and she gave him everlasting honor.
### Wisdom Led the Israelites out of Egypt
15 A holy people and blameless race wisdombdelivered from a nation of oppressors.
16 She entered the soul of a servant of the Lord, and withstood dread kings with wonders and signs.
17 She gave holy men the reward of their labors; she guided them along a marvelous way, and became a shelter to them by day, and a starry flame through the night.
18 She brought them over the Red Sea, and led them through deep waters;
19 but she drowned their enemies, and cast them up from the depth of the sea.
20 Therefore the righteous plundered the ungodly; they sang hymns, O Lord, to thy holy name, and praised with one accord thy defending hand,
21 because wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tongues of babes speak clearly.


# Liber Sapientiae 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Hæc illum qui primus formatus est a Deo patre orbis terrarum,cum solus esset creatus, custodivit,
2 et eduxit illum a delicto suo,et dedit illi virtutem continendi omnia.
3 Ab hac ut recessit injustus in ira sua,per iram homicidii fraterni deperiit.
4 Propter quem cum aqua deleret terram, sanavit iterum sapientia,per contemptibile lignum justum gubernans.
5 Hæc et in consensu nequitiæ, cum se nationes contulissent,scivit justum, et conservavit sine querela Deo,et in filii misericordia fortem custodivit.
6 Hæc justum a pereuntibus impiis liberavit fugientem,descendente igne in Pentapolim:
7 quibus in testimonium nequitiæfumigabunda constat deserta terra,et incerto tempore fructus habentes arbores:et incredibilis animæ memoria stans figmentum salis.
8 Sapientiam enim prætereuntes,non tantum in hoc lapsi sunt ut ignorarent bona,sed et insipientiæ suæ reliquerunt hominibus memoriam,ut in his quæ peccaverunt nec latere potuissent.

9 Sapientia autem hos qui se observanta doloribus liberavit.
10 Hæc profugum iræ fratris justum deduxit per vias rectas,et ostendit illi regnum Dei,et dedit illi scientiam sanctorum;honestavit illum in laboribus,et complevit labores illius.
11 In fraude circumvenientium illum affuit illi,et honestum fecit illum.
12 Custodivit illum ab inimicis,et a seductoribus tutavit illum:et certamen forte dedit illi ut vinceret,et sciret quoniam omnium potentior est sapientia.
13 Hæc venditum justum non dereliquit,sed a peccatoribus liberavit eum;descenditque cum illo in foveam,
14 et in vinculis non dereliquit illum,donec afferret illi sceptrum regni,et potentiam adversus eos qui eum deprimebant:et mendaces ostendit qui maculaverunt illum,et dedit illi claritatem æternam.

15 Hæc populum justum et semen sine querela liberavita nationibus quæ illum deprimebant.
16 Intravit in animam servi Dei,et stetit contra reges horrendos in portentis et signis.
17 Et reddidit justis mercedem laborum suorum,et deduxit illos in via mirabili:et fuit illis in velamento diei,et in luce stellarum per noctem;
18 transtulit illos per mare Rubrum,et transvexit illos per aquam nimiam.
19 Inimicos autem illorum demersit in mare,et ab altitudine inferorum eduxit illos.Ideo justi tulerunt spolia impiorum,
20 et decantaverunt, Domine, nomen sanctum tuum,et victricem manum tuam laudaverunt pariter:
21 quoniam sapientia aperuit os mutorum,et linguas infantium fecit disertas.


# Σοφία Σαλoμῶντος 10 (Septuagint)

1 αὕτη πρωτόπλαστον πατέρα κόσμου μόνον κτισθέντα διεφύλαξεν καὶ ἐξείλατο αὐτὸν ἐκ παραπτώματος ἰδίου
2 ἔδωκέν τε αὐτῷ ἰσχὺν κρατῆσαι ἁπάντων
3 ἀποστὰς δὲ ἀ{P'} αὐτῆς ἄδικος ἐν ὀργῇ αὐτοῦ ἀδελφοκτόνοις συναπώλετο θυμοῖς
4 δ{I'} ὃν κατακλυζομένην γῆν πάλιν ἔσωσεν σοφία δ{I'} εὐτελοῦς ξύλου τὸν δίκαιον κυβερνήσασα
5 αὕτη καὶ ἐν ὁμονοίᾳ πονηρίας ἐθνῶν συγχυθέντων ἔγνω τὸν δίκαιον καὶ ἐτήρησεν αὐτὸν ἄμεμπτον θεῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τέκνου σπλάγχνοις ἰσχυρὸν ἐφύλαξεν
6 αὕτη δίκαιον ἐξαπολλυμένων ἀσεβῶν ἐρρύσατο φυγόντα καταβάσιον πῦρ Πενταπόλεως
7 ἧς ἔτι μαρτύριον τῆς πονηρίας καπνιζομένη καθέστηκε χέρσος καὶ ἀτελέσιν ὥραις καρποφοροῦντα φυτά ἀπιστούσης ψυχῆς μνημεῖον ἑστηκυῖα στήλη ἁλός
8 σοφίαν γὰρ παροδεύσαντες οὐ μόνον ἐβλάβησαν τοῦ μὴ γνῶναι τὰ καλά ἀλλὰ καὶ τῆς ἀφροσύνης ἀπέλιπον τῷ βίῳ μνημόσυνον ἵνα ἐν οἷς ἐσφάλησαν μηδὲ λαθεῖν δυνηθῶσιν

9 σοφία δὲ τοὺς θεραπεύοντας αὐτὴν ἐκ πόνων ἐρρύσατο
10 αὕτη φυγάδα ὀργῆς ἀδελφοῦ δίκαιον ὡδήγησεν ἐν τρίβοις εὐθείαις ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ βασιλείαν θεοῦ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ γνῶσιν ἁγίων εὐπόρησεν αὐτὸν ἐν μόχθοις καὶ ἐπλήθυνεν τοὺς πόνους αὐτοῦ
11 ἐν πλεονεξίᾳ κατισχυόντων αὐτὸν παρέστη καὶ ἐπλούτισεν αὐτόν
12 διεφύλαξεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ ἐχθρῶν καὶ ἀπὸ ἐνεδρευόντων ἠσφαλίσατο καὶ ἀγῶνα ἰσχυρὸν ἐβράβευσεν αὐτῷ ἵνα γνῷ ὅτι παντὸς δυνατωτέρα ἐστὶν εὐσέβεια
13 αὕτη πραθέντα δίκαιον οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπεν ἀλλὰ ἐξ ἁμαρτίας ἐρρύσατο αὐτόν
14 συγκατέβη αὐτῷ εἰς λάκκον καὶ ἐν δεσμοῖς οὐκ ἀφῆκεν αὐτόν ἕως ἤνεγκεν αὐτῷ σκῆπτρα βασιλείας καὶ ἐξουσίαν τυραννούντων αὐτοῦ ψευδεῖς τε ἔδειξεν τοὺς μωμησαμένους αὐτὸν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ δόξαν αἰώνιον

15 αὕτη λαὸν ὅσιον καὶ σπέρμα ἄμεμπτον ἐρρύσατο ἐξ ἔθνους θλιβόντων
16 εἰσῆλθεν εἰς ψυχὴν θεράποντος κυρίου καὶ ἀντέστη βασιλεῦσιν φοβεροῖς ἐν τέρασι καὶ σημείοις
17 ἀπέδωκεν ὁσίοις μισθὸν κόπων αὐτῶν ὡδήγησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ὁδῷ θαυμαστῇ καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς εἰς σκέπην ἡμέρας καὶ εἰς φλόγα ἄστρων τὴν νύκτα
18 διεβίβασεν αὐτοὺς θάλασσαν ἐρυθρὰν καὶ διήγαγεν αὐτοὺς δ{I'} ὕδατος πολλοῦ
19 τοὺς δὲ ἐχθροὺς αὐτῶν κατέκλυσεν καὶ ἐκ βάθους ἀβύσσου ἀνέβρασεν αὐτούς
20 διὰ τοῦτο δίκαιοι ἐσκύλευσαν ἀσεβεῖς καὶ ὕμνησαν κύριε τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ἅγιόν σου τήν τε ὑπέρμαχόν σου χεῖρα ᾔνεσαν ὁμοθυμαδόν
21 ὅτι ἡ σοφία ἤνοιξεν στόμα κωφῶν καὶ γλώσσας νηπίων ἔθηκεν τρανάς
