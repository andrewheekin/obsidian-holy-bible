# Book of Esther 7 (RSVCE)

1 So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther.
2 And on the second day, as they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.”
3 Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.
4 For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have held my peace; for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king.”
5 Then King Ahasu-eʹrus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, that would presume to do this?”
6 And Esther said, “A foe and enemy! This wicked Haman!” Then Haman was in terror before the king and the queen.
7 And the king rose from the feast in wrath and went into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king.
8 And the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, as Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was; and the king said, “Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?” As the words left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman’s face.
9 Then said Harboʹna, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, “Moreover, the gallows which Haman has prepared for Morʹdecai, whose word saved the king, is standing in Haman’s house, fifty cubits high.”
10 And the king said, “Hang him on that.” So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Morʹdecai. Then the anger of the king abated.


# Liber Esther 7 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Intravit itaque rex et Aman, ut biberent cum regina.
2 Dixitque ei rex etiam secunda die, postquam vino incaluerat: Quæ est petitio tua, Esther, ut detur tibi? et quid vis fieri? etiam si dimidiam partem regni mei petieris, impetrabis.
3 Ad quem illa respondit: Si inveni gratiam in oculis tuis o rex, et si tibi placet, dona mihi animam meam pro qua rogo, et populum meum pro quo obsecro.
4 Traditi enim sumus ego et populus meus, ut conteramur, jugulemur, et pereamus. Atque utinam in servos et famulas venderemur: esset tolerabile malum, et gemens tacerem: nunc autem hostis noster est, cujus crudelitas redundat in regem.
5 Respondensque rex Assuerus, ait: Quis est iste, et cujus potentiæ, ut hæc audeat facere?
6 Dixitque Esther: Hostis et inimicus noster pessimus iste est Aman. Quod ille audiens, illico obstupuit, vultum regis ac reginæ ferre non sustinens.
7 Rex autem iratus surrexit, et de loco convivii intravit in hortum arboribus consitum. Aman quoque surrexit ut rogaret Esther reginam pro anima sua: intellexit enim a rege sibi paratum malum.
8 Qui cum reversus esset de horto nemoribus consito, et intrasset convivii locum, reperit Aman super lectulum corruisse in quo jacebat Esther, et ait: Etiam reginam vult opprimere, me præsente, in domo mea. Necdum verbum de ore regis exierat, et statim operuerunt faciem ejus.

9 Dixitque Harbona, unus de eunuchis, qui stabant in ministerio regis: En lignum quod paraverat Mardochæo, qui locutus est pro rege, stat in domo Aman, habens altitudinis quinquaginta cubitos. Cui dixit rex: Appendite eum in eo.
10 Suspensus est itaque Aman in patibulo quod paraverat Mardochæo: et regis ira quievit.


# Ἐσθήρ 7 (Septuagint)

1 εἰσῆλθεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ Αμαν συμπιεῖν τῇ βασιλίσσῃ
2 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς Εσθηρ τῇ δευτέρᾳ ἡμέρᾳ ἐν τῷ πότῳ τί ἐστιν Εσθηρ βασίλισσα καὶ τί τὸ αἴτημά σου καὶ τί τὸ ἀξίωμά σου καὶ ἔστω σοι ἕως τοῦ ἡμίσους τῆς βασιλείας μου
3 καὶ ἀποκριθεῖσα εἶπεν εἰ εὗρον χάριν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως δοθήτω ἡ ψυχή μου τῷ αἰτήματί μου καὶ ὁ λαός μου τῷ ἀξιώματί μου
4 ἐπράθημεν γὰρ ἐγώ τε καὶ ὁ λαός μου εἰς ἀπώλειαν καὶ διαρπαγὴν καὶ δουλείαν ἡμεῖς καὶ τὰ τέκνα ἡμῶν εἰς παῖδας καὶ παιδίσκας καὶ παρήκουσα οὐ γὰρ ἄξιος ὁ διάβολος τῆς αὐλῆς τοῦ βασιλέως
5 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεύς τίς οὗτος ὅστις ἐτόλμησεν ποιῆσαι τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο
6 εἶπεν δὲ Εσθηρ ἄνθρωπος ἐχθρὸς Αμαν ὁ πονηρὸς οὗτος Αμαν δὲ ἐταράχθη ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῆς βασιλίσσης
7 ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἐξανέστη ἐκ τοῦ συμποσίου εἰς τὸν κῆπον ὁ δὲ Αμαν παρῃτεῖτο τὴν βασίλισσαν ἑώρα γὰρ ἑαυτὸν ἐν κακοῖς ὄντα
8 ἐπέστρεψεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐκ τοῦ κήπου Αμαν δὲ ἐπιπεπτώκει ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην ἀξιῶν τὴν βασίλισσαν εἶπεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεύς ὥστε καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα βιάζῃ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ μου Αμαν δὲ ἀκούσας διετράπη τῷ προσώπῳ

9 εἶπεν δὲ Βουγαθαν εἷς τῶν εὐνούχων πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἰδοὺ καὶ ξύλον ἡτοίμασεν Αμαν Μαρδοχαίῳ τῷ λαλήσαντι περὶ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ὤρθωται ἐν τοῖς Αμαν ξύλον πηχῶν πεντήκοντα εἶπεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεύς σταυρωθήτω ἐ{P'} αὐτοῦ
10 καὶ ἐκρεμάσθη Αμαν ἐπὶ τοῦ ξύλου ὃ ἡτοίμασεν Μαρδοχαίῳ καὶ τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐκόπασεν τοῦ θυμοῦ
