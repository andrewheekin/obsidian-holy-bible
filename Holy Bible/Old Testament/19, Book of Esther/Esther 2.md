# Book of Esther 2 (RSVCE)

### Esther Becomes Queen
1 After these things, when the anger of King Ahasu-eʹrus had abated, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her.
2 Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king.
3 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in Susa the capital, under custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch who is in charge of the women; let their ointments be given them.
4 And let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” This pleased the king, and he did so.
5 Now there was a Jew in Susa the capital whose name was Morʹdecai, the son of Jaʹir, son of Shimʹe-i, son of Kish, a Benjaminite,
6 who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconiʹah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezʹzar king of Babylon had carried away.
7 He had brought up Hadasʹsah, that is Esther, the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother; the maiden was beautiful and lovely, and when her father and her mother died, Morʹdecai adopted her as his own daughter.
8 So when the king’s order and his edict were proclaimed, and when many maidens were gathered in Susa the capital in custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken into the king’s palace and put in custody of Hegai who had charge of the women.
9 And the maiden pleased him and won his favor; and he quickly provided her with her ointments and her portion of food, and with seven chosen maids from the king’s palace, and advanced her and her maids to the best place in the harem.
10 Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Morʹdecai had charged her not to make it known.
11 And every day Morʹdecai walked in front of the court of the harem, to learn how Esther was and how she fared.
12 Now when the turn came for each maiden to go in to King Ahasu-eʹrus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their beautifying, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women—
13 when the maiden went in to the king in this way she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace.
14 In the evening she went, and in the morning she came back to the second harem in custody of Sha-ashʹgaz the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines; she did not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.
15 When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abʹihail the uncle of Morʹdecai, who had adopted her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king’s eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised. Now Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her.
16 And when Esther was taken to King Ahasu-eʹrus into his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign,
17 the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
18 Then the king gave a great banquet to all his princes and servants; it was Esther’s banquet. He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces, and gave gifts with royal liberality.
### Mordecai Discovers a Plot
19 When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Morʹdecai was sitting at the king’s gate.
20 Now Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Morʹdecai had charged her; for Esther obeyed Morʹdecai just as when she was brought up by him.
21 And in those days, as Morʹdecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasu-eʹrus.
22 And this came to the knowledge of Morʹdecai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Morʹdecai.
23 When the affair was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on the gallows. And it was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king.


# Liber Esther 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 His ita gestis, postquam regis Assueri indignatio deferbuerat, recordatus est Vasthi, et quæ fecisset, vel quæ passa esset:
2 dixeruntque pueri regis ac ministri ejus: Quærantur regi puellæ virgines ac speciosæ,
3 et mittantur qui considerent per universas provincias puellas speciosas et virgines: et adducant eas ad civitatem Susan, et tradant eas in domum feminarum sub manu Egei eunuchi, qui est præpositus et custos mulierum regiarum: et accipiant mundum muliebrem, et cetera ad usus necessaria.
4 Et quæcumque inter omnes oculis regis placuerit, ipsa regnet pro Vasthi. Placuit sermo regi: et ita, ut suggesserant, jussit fieri.

5 Erat vir Judæus in Susan civitate, vocabulo Mardochæus filius Jair, filii Semei, filii Cis, de stirpe Jemini,
6 qui translatus fuerat de Jerusalem eo tempore quo Jechoniam regem Juda Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis transtulerat,
7 qui fuit nutritius filiæ fratris sui Edissæ, quæ altero nomine vocabatur Esther, et utrumque parentem amiserat: pulchra nimis, et decora facie. Mortuisque patre ejus ac matre, Mardochæus sibi eam adoptavit in filiam.
8 Cumque percrebruisset regis imperium, et juxta mandatum illius multæ pulchræ virgines adducerentur Susan, et Egeo traderentur eunucho, Esther quoque inter ceteras puellas ei tradita est, ut servaretur in numero feminarum.
9 Quæ placuit ei, et invenit gratiam in conspectu illius. Et præcepit eunucho, ut acceleraret mundum muliebrem, et traderet ei partes suas, et septem puellas speciosissimas de domo regis, et tam ipsam quam pedissequas ejus ornaret atque excoleret.
10 Quæ noluit indicare ei populum et patriam suam: Mardochæus enim præceperat ei, ut de hac re omnino reticeret:
11 qui deambulabat quotidie ante vestibulum domus, in qua electæ virgines servabantur, curam agens salutis Esther, et scire volens quid ei accideret.

12 Cum autem venisset tempus singularum per ordinem puellarum ut intrarent ad regem, expletis omnibus quæ ad cultum muliebrem pertinebant, mensis duodecimus vertebatur: ita dumtaxat, ut sex mensibus oleo ungerentur myrrhino, et aliis sex quibusdam pigmentis et aromatibus uterentur.
13 Ingredientesque ad regem, quidquid postulassent ad ornatum pertinens, accipiebant: et ut eis placuerat, compositæ de triclinio feminarum ad regis cubiculum transibant.
14 Et quæ intraverat vespere, egrediebatur mane, atque inde in secundas ædes deducebatur, quæ sub manu Susagazi eunuchi erant, qui concubinis regis præsidebat: nec habebat potestatem ad regem ultra redeundi, nisi voluisset rex, et eam venire jussisset ex nomine.

15 Evoluto autem tempore per ordinem, instabat dies quo Esther filia Abihail fratris Mardochæi, quam sibi adoptaverat in filiam, deberet intrare ad regem. Quæ non quæsivit muliebrem cultum, sed quæcumque voluit Egeus eunuchus custos virginum, hæc ei ad ornatum dedit. Erat enim formosa valde, et incredibili pulchritudine: omnium oculis gratiosa et amabilis videbatur.
16 Ducta est itaque ad cubiculum regis Assueri mense decimo, qui vocatur Tebeth, septimo anno regni ejus.
17 Et adamavit eam rex plus quam omnes mulieres, habuitque gratiam et misericordiam coram eo super omnes mulieres: et posuit diadema regni in capite ejus, fecitque eam regnare in loco Vasthi.
18 Et jussit convivium præparari permagnificum cunctis principibus et servis suis pro conjunctione et nuptiis Esther. Et dedit requiem universis provinciis, ac dona largitus est juxta magnificentiam principalem.

19 Cumque secundo quærerentur virgines et congregarentur, Mardochæus manebat ad januam regis:
20 necdum prodiderat Esther patriam et populum suum, juxta mandatum ejus. Quidquid enim ille præcipiebat, observabat Esther: et ita cuncta faciebat ut eo tempore solita erat, quo eam parvulam nutriebat.
21 Eo igitur tempore, quo Mardochæus ad regis januam morabatur, irati sunt Bagathan et Thares duo eunuchi regis, qui janitores erant, et in primo palatii limine præsidebant: volueruntque insurgere in regem, et occidere eum.
22 Quod Mardochæum non latuit, statimque nuntiavit reginæ Esther: et illa regi ex nomine Mardochæi, qui ad se rem detulerat.
23 Quæsitum est, et inventum: et appensus est uterque eorum in patibulo. Mandatumque est historiis, et annalibus traditum coram rege.


# Ἐσθήρ 2 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἐκόπασεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ θυμοῦ καὶ οὐκέτι ἐμνήσθη τῆς Αστιν μνημονεύων οἷα ἐλάλησεν καὶ ὡς κατέκρινεν αὐτήν
2 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ διάκονοι τοῦ βασιλέως ζητηθήτω τῷ βασιλεῖ κοράσια ἄφθορα καλὰ τῷ εἴδει
3 καὶ καταστήσει ὁ βασιλεὺς κωμάρχας ἐν πάσαις ταῖς χώραις τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπιλεξάτωσαν κοράσια παρθενικὰ καλὰ τῷ εἴδει εἰς Σουσαν τὴν πόλιν εἰς τὸν γυναικῶνα καὶ παραδοθήτωσαν τῷ εὐνούχῳ τοῦ βασιλέως τῷ φύλακι τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ δοθήτω σμῆγμα καὶ ἡ λοιπὴ ἐπιμέλεια
4 καὶ ἡ γυνή ἣ ἂν ἀρέσῃ τῷ βασιλεῖ βασιλεύσει ἀντὶ Αστιν καὶ ἤρεσεν τῷ βασιλεῖ τὸ πρᾶγμα καὶ ἐποίησεν οὕτως

5 καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἦν Ιουδαῖος ἐν Σούσοις τῇ πόλει καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Μαρδοχαῖος ὁ τοῦ Ιαϊρου τοῦ Σεμεϊου τοῦ Κισαιου ἐκ φυλῆς Βενιαμιν
6 ὃς ἦν αἰχμάλωτος ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ ἣν ᾐχμαλώτευσεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος
7 καὶ ἦν τούτῳ παῖς θρεπτή θυγάτηρ Αμιναδαβ ἀδελφοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῇ Εσθηρ ἐν δὲ τῷ μεταλλάξαι αὐτῆς τοὺς γονεῖς ἐπαίδευσεν αὐτὴν ἑαυτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα καὶ ἦν τὸ κοράσιον καλὸν τῷ εἴδει
8 καὶ ὅτε ἠκούσθη τὸ τοῦ βασιλέως πρόσταγμα συνήχθησαν κοράσια πολλὰ εἰς Σουσαν τὴν πόλιν ὑπὸ χεῖρα Γαι καὶ ἤχθη Εσθηρ πρὸς Γαι τὸν φύλακα τῶν γυναικῶν
9 καὶ ἤρεσεν αὐτῷ τὸ κοράσιον καὶ εὗρεν χάριν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔσπευσεν αὐτῇ δοῦναι τὸ σμῆγμα καὶ τὴν μερίδα καὶ τὰ ἑπτὰ κοράσια τὰ ἀποδεδειγμένα αὐτῇ ἐκ βασιλικοῦ καὶ ἐχρήσατο αὐτῇ καλῶς καὶ ταῖς ἅβραις αὐτῆς ἐν τῷ γυναικῶνι
10 καὶ οὐχ ὑπέδειξεν Εσθηρ τὸ γένος αὐτῆς οὐδὲ τὴν πατρίδα ὁ γὰρ Μαρδοχαῖος ἐνετείλατο αὐτῇ μὴ ἀπαγγεῖλαι
11 κα{Q'} ἑκάστην δὲ ἡμέραν ὁ Μαρδοχαῖος περιεπάτει κατὰ τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν γυναικείαν ἐπισκοπῶν τί Εσθηρ συμβήσεται

12 οὗτος δὲ ἦν καιρὸς κορασίου εἰσελθεῖν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ὅταν ἀναπληρώσῃ μῆνας δέκα δύο οὕτως γὰρ ἀναπληροῦνται αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς θεραπείας μῆνας ἓξ ἀλειφόμεναι ἐν σμυρνίνῳ ἐλαίῳ καὶ μῆνας ἓξ ἐν τοῖς ἀρώμασιν καὶ ἐν τοῖς σμήγμασιν τῶν γυναικῶν
13 καὶ τότε εἰσπορεύεται πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ ὃ ἐὰν εἴπῃ παραδώσει αὐτῇ συνεισέρχεσθαι αὐτῇ ἀπὸ τοῦ γυναικῶνος ἕως τῶν βασιλείων
14 δείλης εἰσπορεύεται καὶ πρὸς ἡμέραν ἀποτρέχει εἰς τὸν γυναικῶνα τὸν δεύτερον οὗ Γαι ὁ εὐνοῦχος τοῦ βασιλέως ὁ φύλαξ τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ οὐκέτι εἰσπορεύεται πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἐὰν μὴ κληθῇ ὀνόματι

15 ἐν δὲ τῷ ἀναπληροῦσθαι τὸν χρόνον Εσθηρ τῆς θυγατρὸς Αμιναδαβ ἀδελφοῦ πατρὸς Μαρδοχαίου εἰσελθεῖν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα οὐδὲν ἠθέτησεν ὧν αὐτῇ ἐνετείλατο ὁ εὐνοῦχος ὁ φύλαξ τῶν γυναικῶν ἦν γὰρ Εσθηρ εὑρίσκουσα χάριν παρὰ πάντων τῶν βλεπόντων αὐτήν
16 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Εσθηρ πρὸς Ἀρταξέρξην τὸν βασιλέα τῷ δωδεκάτῳ μηνί ὅς ἐστιν Αδαρ τῷ ἑβδόμῳ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ
17 καὶ ἠράσθη ὁ βασιλεὺς Εσθηρ καὶ εὗρεν χάριν παρὰ πάσας τὰς παρθένους καὶ ἐπέθηκεν αὐτῇ τὸ διάδημα τὸ γυναικεῖον
18 καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πότον πᾶσι τοῖς φίλοις αὐτοῦ καὶ ταῖς δυνάμεσιν ἐπὶ ἡμέρας ἑπτὰ καὶ ὕψωσεν τοὺς γάμους Εσθηρ καὶ ἄφεσιν ἐποίησεν τοῖς ὑπὸ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ

19 ὁ δὲ Μαρδοχαῖος ἐθεράπευεν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ
20 ἡ δὲ Εσθηρ οὐχ ὑπέδειξεν τὴν πατρίδα αὐτῆς οὕτως γὰρ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῇ Μαρδοχαῖος φοβεῖσθαι τὸν θεὸν καὶ ποιεῖν τὰ προστάγματα αὐτοῦ καθὼς ἦν με{T'} αὐτοῦ καὶ Εσθηρ οὐ μετήλλαξεν τὴν ἀγωγὴν αὐτῆς
21 καὶ ἐλυπήθησαν οἱ δύο εὐνοῦχοι τοῦ βασιλέως οἱ ἀρχισωματοφύλακες ὅτι προήχθη Μαρδοχαῖος καὶ ἐζήτουν ἀποκτεῖναι Ἀρταξέρξην τὸν βασιλέα
22 καὶ ἐδηλώθη Μαρδοχαίῳ ὁ λόγος καὶ ἐσήμανεν Εσθηρ καὶ αὐτὴ ἐνεφάνισεν τῷ βασιλεῖ τὰ τῆς ἐπιβουλῆς
23 ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἤτασεν τοὺς δύο εὐνούχους καὶ ἐκρέμασεν αὐτούς καὶ προσέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καταχωρίσαι εἰς μνημόσυνον ἐν τῇ βασιλικῇ βιβλιοθήκῃ ὑπὲρ τῆς εὐνοίας Μαρδοχαίου ἐν ἐγκωμίῳ
