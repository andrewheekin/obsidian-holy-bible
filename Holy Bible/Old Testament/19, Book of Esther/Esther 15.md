# Book of Esther 15 (RSVCE)

### Esther Is Received by the King
1 On the third day, when she ended her prayer, she took off the garments in which she had worshiped, and arrayed herself in splendid attire.
2 Then, majestically adorned, after invoking the aid of the all-seeing God and Savior, she took her two maids with her,
3 leaning daintily on one,
4 while the other followed carrying her train.
5 She was radiant with perfect beauty, and she looked happy, as if beloved, but her heart was frozen with fear.
6 When she had gone through all the doors, she stood before the king. He was seated on his royal throne, clothed in the full array of his majesty, all covered with gold and precious stones. And he was most terrifying.
7 Lifting his face, flushed with splendor, he looked at her in fierce anger. And the queen faltered, and turned pale and faint, and collapsed upon the head of the maid who went before her.
8 Then God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in alarm he sprang from his throne and took her in his arms until she came to herself. And he comforted her with soothing words, and said to her,
9 “What is it, Esther? I am your brother. Take courage;
10 you shall not die, for our law applies only to the people.Come near.”
11 Then he raised the golden scepter and touched it to her neck;
12 and he embraced her, and said, “Speak to me.”
13 And she said to him, “I saw you, my lord, like an angel of God, and my heart was shaken with fear at your glory.
14 For you are wonderful, my lord, and your countenance is full of grace.”
15 But as she was speaking, she fell fainting.
16 And the king was agitated, and all his servants sought to comfort her.


# Liber Esther 15 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et mandavit ei (haud dubium quin esset Mardochæus) ut ingrederetur ad regem, et rogaret pro populo suo et pro patria sua.
2 Memorare, inquit, dierum humilitatis tuæ, quomodo nutrita sis in manu mea, quia Aman secundus a rege locutus est contra nos in mortem:
3 et tu invoca Dominum, et loquere regi pro nobis, et libera nos de morte.

4 Die autem tertio deposuit vestimenta ornatus sui, et circumdata est gloria sua.
5 Cumque regio fulgeret habitu, et invocasset omnium rectorem et salvatorem Deum, assumpsit duas famulas,
6 et super unam quidem innitebatur, quasi præ deliciis et nimia teneritudine corpus suum ferre non sustinens:
7 altera autem famularum sequebatur dominam, defluentia in humum indumenta sustentans.
8 Ipsa autem roseo colore vultum perfusa, et gratis ac nitentibus oculis, tristem celabat animum, et nimio timore contractum.
9 Ingressa igitur cuncta per ordinem ostia, stetit contra regem, ubi ille residebat super solium regni sui, indutus vestibus regiis, auroque fulgens, et pretiosis lapidibus: eratque terribilis aspectu.
10 Cumque elevasset faciem, et ardentibus oculis furorem pectoris indicasset, regina corruit, et in pallorem colore mutato, lassum super ancillulam reclinavit caput.

11 Convertitque Deus spiritum regis in mansuetudinem, et festinus ac metuens exilivit de solio, et sustentans eam ulnis suis donec rediret ad se, his verbis blandiebatur:
12 Quid habes, Esther? ego sum frater tuus: noli metuere.
13 Non morieris: non enim pro te, sed pro omnibus hæc lex constituta est.
14 Accede igitur, et tange sceptrum.
15 Cumque illa reticeret, tulit auream virgam, et posuit super collum ejus, et osculatus est eam, et ait: Cur mihi non loqueris?
16 Quæ respondit: Vidi te, domine, quasi angelum Dei, et conturbatum est cor meum præ timore gloriæ tuæ.
17 Valde enim mirabilis es, domine, et facies tua plena est gratiarum.
18 Cumque loqueretur, rursus corruit, et pene exanimata est.
19 Rex autem turbabatur, et omnes ministri ejus consolabantur eam.

5 καὶ γενηθεῖσα ἐπιφανὴς ἐπικαλεσαμένη τὸν πάντων ἐπόπτην θεὸν καὶ σωτῆρα παρέλαβεν τὰς δύο ἅβρας
6 καὶ τῇ μὲν μιᾷ ἐπηρείδετο ὡς τρυφερευομένη ἡ δὲ ἑτέρα ἐπηκολούθει κουφίζουσα τὴν ἔνδυσιν αὐτῆς
7 καὶ αὐτὴ ἐρυθριῶσα ἀκμῇ κάλλους αὐτῆς
8 καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς ἱλαρὸν ὡς προσφιλές ἡ δὲ καρδία αὐτῆς ἀπεστενωμένη ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου
9 καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα πάσας τὰς θύρας κατέστη ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσαν στολὴν τῆς ἐπιφανείας αὐτοῦ ἐνεδεδύκει ὅλος διὰ χρυσοῦ καὶ λίθων πολυτελῶν καὶ ἦν φοβερὸς σφόδρα
10 καὶ ἄρας τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πεπυρωμένον δόξῃ ἐν ἀκμῇ θυμοῦ ἔβλεψεν καὶ ἔπεσεν ἡ βασίλισσα καὶ μετέβαλεν τὸ χρῶμα αὐτῆς ἐν ἐκλύσει καὶ κατεπέκυψεν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τῆς ἅβρας τῆς προπορευομένης

11 καὶ μετέβαλεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς πραΰτητα καὶ ἀγωνιάσας ἀνεπήδησεν ἀπὸ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνέλαβεν αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὰς ἀγκάλας αὐτοῦ μέχρις οὗ κατέστη καὶ παρεκάλει αὐτὴν λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς
12 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ τί ἐστιν Εσθηρ ἐγὼ ὁ ἀδελφός σου θάρσει
13 οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνῃς ὅτι κοινὸν τὸ πρόσταγμα ἡμῶν ἐστιν
14 πρόσελθε
15 καὶ ἄρας τὴν χρυσῆν ῥάβδον ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῆς καὶ ἠσπάσατο αὐτὴν καὶ εἶπεν λάλησόν μοι
16 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ εἶδόν σε κύριε ὡς ἄγγελον θεοῦ καὶ ἐταράχθη ἡ καρδία μου ἀπὸ φόβου τῆς δόξης σου
17 ὅτι θαυμαστὸς εἶ κύριε καὶ τὸ πρόσωπόν σου χαρίτων μεστόν
18 ἐν δὲ τῷ διαλέγεσθαι αὐτὴν ἔπεσεν ἀπὸ ἐκλύσεως αὐτῆς
19 καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐταράσσετο καὶ πᾶσα ἡ θεραπεία αὐτοῦ παρεκάλει αὐτήν
