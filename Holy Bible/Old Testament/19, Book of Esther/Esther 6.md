# Book of Esther 6 (RSVCE)

### The King Honors Mordecai
1 On that night the king could not sleep; and he gave orders to bring the book of memorable deeds, the chronicles, and they were read before the king.
2 And it was found written how Morʹdecai had told about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had sought to lay hands upon King Ahasu-eʹrus.
3 And the king said, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Morʹdecai for this?” The king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”
4 And the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s palace to speak to the king about having Morʹdecai hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
5 So the king’s servants told him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.”
6 So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?” And Haman said to himself, “Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?”
7 And Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor,
8 let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown is set;
9 and let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king’s most noble princes; let him array the man whom the king delights to honor, and let him conduct the man on horseback through the open square of the city, proclaiming before him: ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.’ ”
10 Then the king said to Haman, “Make haste, take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to Morʹdecai the Jew who sits at the king’s gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned.”
11 So Haman took the robes and the horse, and he arrayed Morʹdecai and made him ride through the open square of the city, proclaiming, “Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.”
12 Then Morʹdecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.
13 And Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Morʹdecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him.”
### Haman’s Downfall and Mordecai’s Advancement
14 While they were yet talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and brought Haman in haste to the banquet that Esther had prepared.


# Liber Esther 6 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Noctem illam duxit rex insomnem, jussitque sibi afferri historias et annales priorum temporum. Quæ cum illo præsente legerentur,
2 ventum est ad illum locum ubi scriptum erat quomodo nuntiasset Mardochæus insidias Bagathan et Thares eunuchorum, regem Assuerum jugulare cupientium.
3 Quod cum audisset rex, ait: Quid pro hac fide honoris ac præmii Mardochæus consecutus est? Dixerunt ei servi illius ac ministri: Nihil omnino mercedis accepit.
4 Statimque rex: Quis est, inquit, in atrio? Aman quippe interius atrium domus regiæ intraverat, ut suggereret regi, et juberet Mardochæum affigi patibulo, quod ei fuerat præparatum.
5 Responderunt pueri: Aman stat in atrio. Dixitque rex: Ingrediatur.

6 Cumque esset ingressus, ait illi: Quid debet fieri viro, quem rex honorare desiderat? Cogitans autem in corde suo Aman, et reputans quod nullum alium rex, nisi se, vellet honorare,
7 respondit: Homo, quem rex honorare cupit,
8 debet indui vestibus regiis, et imponi super equum, qui de sella regis est, et accipere regium diadema super caput suum:
9 et primus de regiis principibus ac tyrannis teneat equum ejus, et per plateam civitatis incedens clamet, et dicat: Sic honorabitur, quemcumque voluerit rex honorare.
10 Dixitque ei rex: Festina, et sumpta stola et equo, fac, ut locutus es, Mardochæo Judæo, qui sedet ante fores palatii. Cave ne quidquam de his, quæ locutus es, prætermittas.

11 Tulit itaque Aman stolam et equum, indutumque Mardochæum in platea civitatis, et impositum equo præcedebat, atque clamabat: Hoc honore condignus est, quemcumque rex voluerit honorare.
12 Reversusque est Mardochæus ad januam palatii: et Aman festinavit ire in domum suam, lugens et operto capite:
13 narravitque Zares uxori suæ, et amicis, omnia quæ evenissent sibi. Cui responderunt sapientes quos habebat in consilio, et uxor ejus: Si de semine Judæorum est Mardochæus, ante quem cadere cœpisti, non poteris ei resistere, sed cades in conspectu ejus.
14 Adhuc illis loquentibus, venerunt eunuchi regis, et cito eum ad convivium, quod regina paraverat, pergere compulerunt.


# Ἐσθήρ 6 (Septuagint)

1 ὁ δὲ κύριος ἀπέστησεν τὸν ὕπνον ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην καὶ εἶπεν τῷ διδασκάλῳ αὐτοῦ εἰσφέρειν γράμματα μνημόσυνα τῶν ἡμερῶν ἀναγινώσκειν αὐτῷ
2 εὗρεν δὲ τὰ γράμματα τὰ γραφέντα περὶ Μαρδοχαίου ὡς ἀπήγγειλεν τῷ βασιλεῖ περὶ τῶν δύο εὐνούχων τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν τῷ φυλάσσειν αὐτοὺς καὶ ζητῆσαι ἐπιβαλεῖν τὰς χεῖρας Ἀρταξέρξῃ
3 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεύς τίνα δόξαν ἢ χάριν ἐποιήσαμεν τῷ Μαρδοχαίῳ καὶ εἶπαν οἱ διάκονοι τοῦ βασιλέως οὐκ ἐποίησας αὐτῷ οὐδέν
4 ἐν δὲ τῷ πυνθάνεσθαι τὸν βασιλέα περὶ τῆς εὐνοίας Μαρδοχαίου ἰδοὺ Αμαν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ εἶπεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεύς τίς ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ ὁ δὲ Αμαν εἰσῆλθεν εἰπεῖν τῷ βασιλεῖ κρεμάσαι τὸν Μαρδοχαῖον ἐπὶ τῷ ξύλῳ ᾧ ἡτοίμασεν
5 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ διάκονοι τοῦ βασιλέως ἰδοὺ Αμαν ἕστηκεν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς καλέσατε αὐτόν

6 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Αμαν τί ποιήσω τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ὃν ἐγὼ θέλω δοξάσαι εἶπεν δὲ ἐν ἑαυτῷ Αμαν τίνα θέλει ὁ βασιλεὺς δοξάσαι εἰ μὴ ἐμέ
7 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἄνθρωπον ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς θέλει δοξάσαι
8 ἐνεγκάτωσαν οἱ παῖδες τοῦ βασιλέως στολὴν βυσσίνην ἣν ὁ βασιλεὺς περιβάλλεται καὶ ἵππον ἐ{F'} ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπιβαίνει
9 καὶ δότω ἑνὶ τῶν φίλων τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν ἐνδόξων καὶ στολισάτω τὸν ἄνθρωπον ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀγαπᾷ καὶ ἀναβιβασάτω αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον καὶ κηρυσσέτω διὰ τῆς πλατείας τῆς πόλεως λέγων οὕτως ἔσται παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς δοξάζει
10 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Αμαν καθὼς ἐλάλησας οὕτως ποίησον τῷ Μαρδοχαίῳ τῷ Ιουδαίῳ τῷ θεραπεύοντι ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ καὶ μὴ παραπεσάτω σου λόγος ὧν ἐλάλησας

11 ἔλαβεν δὲ Αμαν τὴν στολὴν καὶ τὸν ἵππον καὶ ἐστόλισεν τὸν Μαρδοχαῖον καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον καὶ διῆλθεν διὰ τῆς πλατείας τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐκήρυσσεν λέγων οὕτως ἔσται παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς θέλει δοξάσαι
12 ἐπέστρεψεν δὲ ὁ Μαρδοχαῖος εἰς τὴν αὐλήν Αμαν δὲ ὑπέστρεψεν εἰς τὰ ἴδια λυπούμενος κατὰ κεφαλῆς
13 καὶ διηγήσατο Αμαν τὰ συμβεβηκότα αὐτῷ Ζωσαρα τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῖς φίλοις καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτὸν οἱ φίλοι καὶ ἡ γυνή εἰ ἐκ γένους Ιουδαίων Μαρδοχαῖος ἦρξαι ταπεινοῦσθαι ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ πεσὼν πεσῇ οὐ μὴ δύνῃ αὐτὸν ἀμύνασθαι ὅτι θεὸς ζῶν με{T'} αὐτοῦ
14 ἔτι αὐτῶν λαλούντων παραγίνονται οἱ εὐνοῦχοι ἐπισπεύδοντες τὸν Αμαν ἐπὶ τὸν πότον ὃν ἡτοίμασεν Εσθηρ
