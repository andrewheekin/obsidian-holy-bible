### Haman Undertakes to Destroy the Jews
1 After these things King Ahasu-eʹrus promoted Haman the Agʹagite, the son of Hammedaʹtha, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.
2 And all the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate bowed down and did obeisance to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Morʹdecai did not bow down or do obeisance.
3 Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Morʹdecai, “Why do you transgress the king’s command?”
4 And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Morʹdecai’s words would avail; for he had told them that he was a Jew.
5 And when Haman saw that Morʹdecai did not bow down or do obeisance to him, Haman was filled with fury.
6 But he disdained to lay hands on Morʹdecai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Morʹdecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Morʹdecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasu-eʹrus.
7 In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasu-eʹrus, they cast Pur, that is the lot, before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
8 Then Haman said to King Ahasu-eʹrus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king’s laws, so that it is not for the king’s profit to tolerate them.
9 If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king’s business, that they may put it into the king’s treasuries.”
10 So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Agʹagite, the son of Hammedaʹtha, the enemy of the Jews.
11 And the king said to Haman, “The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.”
12 Then the king’s secretaries were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king’s satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the princes of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language; it was written in the name of King Ahasu-eʹrus and sealed with the king’s ring.
13 Letters were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.
14 A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day.
15 The couriers went in haste by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the capital. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was perplexed.


# Liber Esther 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Post hæc rex Assuerus exaltavit Aman filium Amadathi, qui erat de stirpe Agag: et posuit solium ejus super omnes principes quos habebat.
2 Cunctique servi regis, qui in foribus palatii versabantur, flectebant genua, et adorabant Aman: sic enim præceperat eis imperator: solus Mardochæus non flectebat genu, neque adorabat eum.
3 Cui dixerunt pueri regis, qui ad fores palatii præsidebant: Cur præter ceteros non observas mandatum regis?
4 Cumque hoc crebrius dicerent, et ille nollet audire, nuntiaverunt Aman, scire cupientes utrum perseveraret in sententia: dixerat enim eis se esse Judæum.
5 Quod cum audisset Aman, et experimento probasset quod Mardochæus non flecteret sibi genu, nec se adoraret, iratus est valde,
6 et pro nihilo duxit in unum Mardochæum mittere manus suas: audierat enim quod esset gentis Judææ; magisque voluit omnem Judæorum, qui erant in regno Assueri, perdere nationem.
7 Mense primo (cujus vocabulum est Nisan), anno duodecimo regni Assueri, missa est sors in urnam, quæ hebraice dicitur phur, coram Aman, quo die et quo mense gens Judæorum deberet interfici: et exivit mensis duodecimus, qui vocatur Adar.

8 Dixitque Aman regi Assuero: Est populus per omnes provincias regni tui dispersus, et a se mutuo separatus, novis utens legibus et cæremoniis, insuper et regis scita contemnens: et optime nosti quod non expediat regno tuo ut insolescat per licentiam.
9 Si tibi placet, decerne, ut pereat, et decem millia talentorum appendam arcariis gazæ tuæ.
10 Tulit ergo rex annulum, quo utebatur, de manu sua, et dedit eum Aman filio Amadathi de progenie Agag, hosti Judæorum,
11 dixitque ad eum: Argentum, quod tu polliceris, tuum sit; de populo age quod tibi placet.
12 Vocatique sunt scribæ regis mense primo Nisan, tertiadecima die ejusdem mensis: et scriptum est, ut jusserat Aman, ad omnes satrapas regis, et judices provinciarum, diversarumque gentium, ut quæque gens legere poterat et audire pro varietate linguarum ex nomine regis Assueri: et litteræ signatæ ipsius annulo
13 missæ sunt per cursores regis ad universas provincias, ut occiderent atque delerent omnes Judæos, a puero usque ad senem, parvulos et mulieres, uno die, hoc est tertiodecimo mensis duodecimi, qui vocatur Adar; et bona eorum diriperent.
14 Summa autem epistolarum hæc fuit, ut omnes provinciæ scirent, et pararent se ad prædictam diem.
15 Festinabant cursores, qui missi erant, regis imperium explere. Statimque in Susan pependit edictum, rege et Aman celebrante convivium, et cunctis Judæis, qui in urbe erant, flentibus.


# Ἐσθήρ 3 (Septuagint)

1 μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ἐδόξασεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀρταξέρξης Αμαν Αμαδαθου Βουγαῖον καὶ ὕψωσεν αὐτόν καὶ ἐπρωτοβάθρει πάντων τῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ πάντες οἱ ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ προσεκύνουν αὐτῷ οὕτως γὰρ προσέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ποιῆσαι ὁ δὲ Μαρδοχαῖος οὐ προσεκύνει αὐτῷ
3 καὶ ἐλάλησαν οἱ ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τοῦ βασιλέως τῷ Μαρδοχαίῳ Μαρδοχαῖε τί παρακούεις τὰ ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως λεγόμενα
4 κα{Q'} ἑκάστην ἡμέραν ἐλάλουν αὐτῷ καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουεν αὐτῶν καὶ ὑπέδειξαν τῷ Αμαν Μαρδοχαῖον τοῖς τοῦ βασιλέως λόγοις ἀντιτασσόμενον καὶ ὑπέδειξεν αὐτοῖς ὁ Μαρδοχαῖος ὅτι Ιουδαῖός ἐστιν
5 καὶ ἐπιγνοὺς Αμαν ὅτι οὐ προσκυνεῖ αὐτῷ Μαρδοχαῖος ἐθυμώθη σφόδρα
6 καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο ἀφανίσαι πάντας τοὺς ὑπὸ τὴν Ἀρταξέρξου βασιλείαν Ιουδαίους
7 καὶ ἐποίησεν ψήφισμα ἐν ἔτει δωδεκάτῳ τῆς βασιλείας Ἀρταξέρξου καὶ ἔβαλεν κλήρους ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας καὶ μῆνα ἐκ μηνὸς ὥστε ἀπολέσαι ἐν μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ τὸ γένος Μαρδοχαίου καὶ ἔπεσεν ὁ κλῆρος εἰς τὴν τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτην τοῦ μηνός ὅς ἐστιν Αδαρ

8 καὶ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἀρταξέρξην λέγων ὑπάρχει ἔθνος διεσπαρμένον ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ σου οἱ δὲ νόμοι αὐτῶν ἔξαλλοι παρὰ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῶν δὲ νόμων τοῦ βασιλέως παρακούουσιν καὶ οὐ συμφέρει τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐᾶσαι αὐτούς
9 εἰ δοκεῖ τῷ βασιλεῖ δογματισάτω ἀπολέσαι αὐτούς κἀγὼ διαγράψω εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον τοῦ βασιλέως ἀργυρίου τάλαντα μύρια
10 καὶ περιελόμενος ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν δακτύλιον ἔδωκεν εἰς χεῖρα τῷ Αμαν σφραγίσαι κατὰ τῶν γεγραμμένων κατὰ τῶν Ιουδαίων
11 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Αμαν τὸ μὲν ἀργύριον ἔχε τῷ δὲ ἔθνει χρῶ ὡς βούλει
12 καὶ ἐκλήθησαν οἱ γραμματεῖς τοῦ βασιλέως μηνὶ πρώτῳ τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ καὶ ἔγραψαν ὡς ἐπέταξεν Αμαν τοῖς στρατηγοῖς καὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσιν κατὰ πᾶσαν χώραν ἀπὸ Ἰνδικῆς ἕως τῆς Αἰθιοπίας ταῖς ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι ἑπτὰ χώραις τοῖς τε ἄρχουσι τῶν ἐθνῶν κατὰ τὴν αὐτῶν λέξιν δ{I'} Ἀρταξέρξου τοῦ βασιλέως
13 καὶ ἀπεστάλη διὰ βιβλιαφόρων εἰς τὴν Ἀρταξέρξου βασιλείαν ἀφανίσαι τὸ γένος τῶν Ιουδαίων ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ μηνὸς δωδεκάτου ὅς ἐστιν Αδαρ καὶ διαρπάσαι τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῶν
14 τὰ δὲ ἀντίγραφα τῶν ἐπιστολῶν ἐξετίθετο κατὰ χώραν καὶ προσετάγη πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἑτοίμους εἶναι εἰς τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην
15 ἐσπεύδετο δὲ τὸ πρᾶγμα καὶ εἰς Σουσαν ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς καὶ Αμαν ἐκωθωνίζοντο ἐταράσσετο δὲ ἡ πόλις
