# Book of Esther 10 (RSVCE)

1 King Ahasu-eʹrus laid tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.
2 And all the acts of his power and might, and the full account of the high honor of Morʹdecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
3 For Morʹdecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasu-eʹrus, and he was great among the Jews and popular with the multitude of his brethren, for he sought the welfare of his people and spoke peace to all his people.
### Mordecai’s Dream Fulfilled
4 And Morʹdecai said, “These things have come from God.
5 For I remember the dream that I had concerning these matters, and none of them has failed to be fulfilled.
6 The tiny spring which became a river, and there was light and the sun and abundant water—the river is Esther, whom the king married and made queen.
7 The two dragons are Haman and myself.
8 The nations are those that gathered to destroy the name of the Jews.
9 And my nation, this is Israel, who cried out to God and were saved. The Lord has saved his people; the Lord has delivered us from all these evils; God has done great signs and wonders, which have not occurred among the nations.
10 For this purpose he made two lots, one for the people of God and one for all the nations.
11 And these two lots came to the hour and moment and day of decision before God and among all the nations.
12 And God remembered his people and vindicated his inheritance.
13 So they will observe these days in the month of Adar, on the fourteenth and fifteenth of that month, with an assembly and joy and gladness before God, from generation to generation for ever among his people Israel.”


# Liber Esther 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Rex vero Assuerus omnem terram et cunctas maris insulas fecit tributarias:
2 cujus fortitudo et imperium, et dignitas atque sublimitas, qua exaltavit Mardochæum, scripta sunt in libris Medorum, atque Persarum:
3 et quomodo Mardochæus judaici generis secundus a rege Assuero fuerit, et magnus apud Judæos, et acceptabilis plebi fratrum suorum, quærens bona populo suo, et loquens ea quæ ad pacem seminis sui pertinerent.

4 Dixitque Mardochæus: A Deo facta sunt ista.
5 Recordatus sum somnii quod videram, hæc eadem significantis: nec eorum quidquam irritum fuit.
6 Parvus fons, qui crevit in fluvium, et in lucem solemque conversus est, et in aquas plurimas redundavit: Esther est quam rex accepit uxorem, et voluit esse reginam.
7 Duo autem dracones: ego sum, et Aman.
8 Gentes, quæ convenerant: hi sunt, qui conati sunt delere nomen Judæorum.
9 Gens autem mea Israël est, quæ clamavit ad Dominum, et salvum fecit Dominus populum suum: liberavitque nos ab omnibus malis, et fecit signa magna atque portenta inter gentes:
10 et duas sortes esse præcepit, unam populi Dei, et alteram cunctarum gentium.
11 Venitque utraque sors in statutum ex illo jam tempore diem coram Deo universis gentibus:
12 et recordatus est Dominus populi sui, ac misertus est hæreditatis suæ.
13 Et observabuntur dies isti in mense Adar quartadecima et quintadecima die ejusdem mensis, cum omni studio et gaudio, in unum cœtum populi congregati, in cunctas deinceps generationes populi Israël.


# Ἐσθήρ 10 (Septuagint)

1 ἔγραψεν δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς τέλη ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν τῆς τε γῆς καὶ τῆς θαλάσσης
2 καὶ τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνδραγαθίαν πλοῦτόν τε καὶ δόξαν τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ ἰδοὺ γέγραπται ἐν βιβλίῳ βασιλέων Περσῶν καὶ Μήδων εἰς μνημόσυνον
3 ὁ δὲ Μαρδοχαῖος διεδέχετο τὸν βασιλέα Ἀρταξέρξην καὶ μέγας ἦν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ καὶ δεδοξασμένος ὑπὸ τῶν Ιουδαίων καὶ φιλούμενος διηγεῖτο τὴν ἀγωγὴν παντὶ τῷ ἔθνει αὐτοῦ

4 καὶ εἶπεν Μαρδοχαῖος παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐγένετο ταῦτα
5 ἐμνήσθην γὰρ περὶ τοῦ ἐνυπνίου οὗ εἶδον περὶ τῶν λόγων τούτων οὐδὲ γὰρ παρῆλθεν ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν λόγος
6 ἡ μικρὰ πηγή ἣ ἐγένετο ποταμὸς καὶ ἦν φῶς καὶ ἥλιος καὶ ὕδωρ πολύ Εσθηρ ἐστὶν ὁ ποταμός ἣν ἐγάμησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ ἐποίησεν βασίλισσαν
7 οἱ δὲ δύο δράκοντες ἐγώ εἰμι καὶ Αμαν
8 τὰ δὲ ἔθνη τὰ ἐπισυναχθέντα ἀπολέσαι τὸ ὄνομα τῶν Ιουδαίων
9 τὸ δὲ ἔθνος τὸ ἐμόν οὗτός ἐστιν Ισραηλ οἱ βοήσαντες πρὸς τὸν θεὸν καὶ σωθέντες καὶ ἔσωσεν κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐρρύσατο κύριος ἡμᾶς ἐκ πάντων τῶν κακῶν τούτων καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τὰ σημεῖα καὶ τὰ τέρατα τὰ μεγάλα ἃ οὐ γέγονεν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν
10 διὰ τοῦτο ἐποίησεν κλήρους δύο ἕνα τῷ λαῷ τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἕνα πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν
11 καὶ ἦλθον οἱ δύο κλῆροι οὗτοι εἰς ὥραν καὶ καιρὸν καὶ εἰς ἡμέραν κρίσεως ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν
12 καὶ ἐμνήσθη ὁ θεὸς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐδικαίωσεν τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ
13 καὶ ἔσονται αὐτοῖς αἱ ἡμέραι αὗται ἐν μηνὶ Αδαρ τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ καὶ τῇ πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ αὐτοῦ μηνὸς μετὰ συναγωγῆς καὶ χαρᾶς καὶ εὐφροσύνης ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ κατὰ γενεὰς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ Ισραηλ
