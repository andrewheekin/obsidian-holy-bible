# Book of Esther 12 (RSVCE)

### A Plot against the King
1 Now Morʹdecai took his rest in the courtyard with Gabʹatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king who kept watch in the courtyard.
2 He overheard their conversation and inquired into their purposes, and learned that they were preparing to lay hands upon Ahasu-eʹrusthe king; and he informed the king concerning them.
3 Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and when they confessed they were led to execution.
4 The king made a permanent record of these things, and Morʹdecai wrote an account of them.
5 And the king ordered Morʹdecai to serve in the court and rewarded him for these things.
6 But Haman, the son of Hammedaʹtha, a Bougaeʹan, was in great honor with the king, and he sought to injure Morʹdecai and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king.


# Liber Esther 12 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Morabatur autem eo tempore in aula regis cum Bagatha et Thara eunuchis regis, qui janitores erant palatii.
2 Cumque intellexisset cogitationes eorum, et curas diligentius pervidisset, didicit quod conarentur in regem Artaxerxem manus mittere, et nuntiavit super eo regi.
3 Qui de utroque, habita quæstione, confessos jussit duci ad mortem.
4 Rex autem quod gestum erat, scripsit in commentariis: sed et Mardochæus rei memoriam litteris tradidit.
5 Præcepitque ei rex, ut in aula palatii moraretur, datis ei pro delatione muneribus.
6 Aman vero filius Amadathi Bugæus erat gloriosissimus coram rege, et voluit nocere Mardochæo et populo ejus pro duobus eunuchis regis qui fuerant interfecti. Et diripuerunt bona, vel substantias eorum. Epistolæ autem hoc exemplar fuit.


# Ἐσθήρ 12 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἡσύχασεν Μαρδοχαῖος ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ μετὰ Γαβαθα καὶ Θαρρα τῶν δύο εὐνούχων τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν φυλασσόντων τὴν αὐλὴν
2 ἤκουσέν τε αὐτῶν τοὺς λογισμοὺς καὶ τὰς μερίμνας αὐτῶν ἐξηρεύνησεν καὶ ἔμαθεν ὅτι ἑτοιμάζουσιν τὰς χεῖρας ἐπιβαλεῖν Ἀρταξέρξῃ τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ ὑπέδειξεν τῷ βασιλεῖ περὶ αὐτῶν
3 καὶ ἐξήτασεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς δύο εὐνούχους καὶ ὁμολογήσαντες ἀπήχθησαν
4 καὶ ἔγραψεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς λόγους τούτους εἰς μνημόσυνον καὶ Μαρδοχαῖος ἔγραψεν περὶ τῶν λόγων τούτων
5 καὶ ἐπέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Μαρδοχαίῳ θεραπεύειν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ δόματα περὶ τούτων
6 καὶ ἦν Αμαν Αμαδαθου Βουγαῖος ἔνδοξος ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐζήτησεν κακοποιῆσαι τὸν Μαρδοχαῖον καὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ὑπὲρ τῶν δύο εὐνούχων τοῦ βασιλέως
