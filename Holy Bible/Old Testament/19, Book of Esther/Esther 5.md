# Book of Esther 5 (RSVCE)

### Esther’s Banquet
1 On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king’s palace, opposite the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne inside the palace opposite the entrance to the palace;
2 and when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his sight and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter.
3 And the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom.”
4 And Esther said, “If it please the king, let the king and Haman come this day to a dinner that I have prepared for the king.”
5 Then said the king, “Bring Haman quickly, that we may do as Esther desires.” So the king and Haman came to the dinner that Esther had prepared.
6 And as they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.”
7 But Esther said, “My petition and my request is:
8 If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and fulfil my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the dinner which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.”
### Haman Plans to Have Mordecai Hanged
9 And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Morʹdecai in the king’s gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Morʹdecai.
10 Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and his wife Zeresh.
11 And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and the servants of the king.
12 And Haman added, “Even Queen Esther let no one come with the king to the banquet she prepared but myself. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.
13 Yet all this does me no good, so long as I see Morʹdecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”
14 Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Morʹdecai hanged upon it; then go merrily with the king to the dinner.” This counsel pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made.


# Liber Esther 5 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Die autem tertio induta est Esther regalibus vestimentis, et stetit in atrio domus regiæ, quod erat interius, contra basilicam regis: at ille sedebat super solium suum in consistorio palatii contra ostium domus.
2 Cumque vidisset Esther reginam stantem, placuit oculis ejus, et extendit contra eam virgam auream, quam tenebat manu: quæ accedens, osculata est summitatem virgæ ejus.
3 Dixitque ad eam rex: Quid vis, Esther regina? quæ est petitio tua? etiam si dimidiam partem regni petieris, dabitur tibi.
4 At illa respondit: Si regi placet, obsecro ut venias ad me hodie, et Aman tecum, ad convivium quod paravi.
5 Statimque rex: Vocate, inquit, cito Aman ut Esther obediat voluntati. Venerunt itaque rex et Aman ad convivium, quod eis regina paraverat.
6 Dixitque ei rex, postquam vinum biberat abundanter: Quid petis ut detur tibi? et pro qua re postulas? etiam si dimidiam partem regni mei petieris, impetrabis.
7 Cui respondit Esther: Petitio mea, et preces sunt istæ:
8 si inveni in conspectu regis gratiam, et si regi placet ut det mihi quod postulo, et meam impleat petitionem: veniat rex et Aman ad convivium quod paravi eis, et cras aperiam regi voluntatem meam.

9 Egressus est itaque illo die Aman lætus et alacer. Cumque vidisset Mardochæum sedentem ante fores palatii, et non solum non assurrexisse sibi, sed nec motum quidem de loco sessionis suæ, indignatus est valde:
10 et dissimulata ira reversus in domum suam, convocavit ad se amicos suos, et Zares uxorem suam,
11 et exposuit illis magnitudinem divitiarum suarum, filiorumque turbam, et quanta eum gloria super omnes principes et servos suos rex elevasset.
12 Et post hæc ait: Regina quoque Esther nullum alium vocavit ad convivium cum rege præter me: apud quam etiam cras cum rege pransurus sum.
13 Et cum hæc omnia habeam, nihil me habere puto, quamdiu videro Mardochæum Judæum sedentem ante fores regias.

14 Responderuntque ei Zares uxor ejus, et ceteri amici: Jube parari excelsam trabem, habentem altitudinis quinquaginta cubitos, et dic mane regi ut appendatur super eam Mardochæus, et sic ibis cum rege lætus ad convivium. Placuit ei consilium, et jussit excelsam parari crucem.


# Ἐσθήρ 5 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ ὡς ἐπαύσατο προσευχομένη ἐξεδύσατο τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς θεραπείας καὶ περιεβάλετο τὴν δόξαν αὐτῆς
2 
3 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς τί θέλεις Εσθηρ καὶ τί σού ἐστιν τὸ ἀξίωμα ἕως τοῦ ἡμίσους τῆς βασιλείας μου καὶ ἔσται σοι
4 εἶπεν δὲ Εσθηρ ἡμέρα μου ἐπίσημος σήμερόν ἐστιν εἰ οὖν δοκεῖ τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐλθάτω καὶ αὐτὸς καὶ Αμαν εἰς τὴν δοχήν ἣν ποιήσω σήμερον
5 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς κατασπεύσατε Αμαν ὅπως ποιήσωμεν τὸν λόγον Εσθηρ καὶ παραγίνονται ἀμφότεροι εἰς τὴν δοχήν ἣν εἶπεν Εσθηρ
6 ἐν δὲ τῷ πότῳ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Εσθηρ τί ἐστιν βασίλισσα Εσθηρ καὶ ἔσται σοι ὅσα ἀξιοῖς
7 καὶ εἶπεν τὸ αἴτημά μου καὶ τὸ ἀξίωμά μου
8 εἰ εὗρον χάριν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως ἐλθάτω ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ Αμαν ἐπὶ τὴν αὔριον εἰς τὴν δοχήν ἣν ποιήσω αὐτοῖς καὶ αὔριον ποιήσω τὰ αὐτά

9 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ Αμαν ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως ὑπερχαρὴς εὐφραινόμενος ἐν δὲ τῷ ἰδεῖν Αμαν Μαρδοχαῖον τὸν Ιουδαῖον ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ ἐθυμώθη σφόδρα
10 καὶ εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὰ ἴδια ἐκάλεσεν τοὺς φίλους καὶ Ζωσαραν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ
11 καὶ ὑπέδειξεν αὐτοῖς τὸν πλοῦτον αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν δόξαν ἣν ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτῷ περιέθηκεν καὶ ὡς ἐποίησεν αὐτὸν πρωτεύειν καὶ ἡγεῖσθαι τῆς βασιλείας
12 καὶ εἶπεν Αμαν οὐ κέκληκεν ἡ βασίλισσα μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως οὐδένα εἰς τὴν δοχὴν ἀλ{L'} ἢ ἐμέ καὶ εἰς τὴν αὔριον κέκλημαι
13 καὶ ταῦτά μοι οὐκ ἀρέσκει ὅταν ἴδω Μαρδοχαῖον τὸν Ιουδαῖον ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ

14 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ζωσαρα ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ φίλοι κοπήτω σοι ξύλον πηχῶν πεντήκοντα ὄρθρου δὲ εἰπὸν τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ κρεμασθήτω Μαρδοχαῖος ἐπὶ τοῦ ξύλου σὺ δὲ εἴσελθε εἰς τὴν δοχὴν σὺν τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ εὐφραίνου καὶ ἤρεσεν τὸ ῥῆμα τῷ Αμαν καὶ ἡτοιμάσθη τὸ ξύλον
