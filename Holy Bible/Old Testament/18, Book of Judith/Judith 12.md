# Book of Judith 12 (RSVCE)

### Judith as a Guest of Holofernes
1 Then he commanded them to bring her in where his silver dishes were kept, and ordered them to set a table for her with some of his own food and to serve her with his own wine.
2 But Judith said, “I cannot eat it, lest it be an offense; but I will be provided from the things I have brought with me.”
3 Holoferʹnes said to her, “If your supply runs out, where can we get more like it for you? For none of your people is here with us.”
4 Judith replied, “As your soul lives, my lord, your servant will not use up the things I have with me before the Lord carries out by my hand what he has determined to do.”
5 Then the servants of Holoferʹnes brought her into the tent, and she slept until midnight. Along toward the morning watch she arose
6 and sent to Holoferʹnes and said, “Let my lord now command that your servant be permitted to go out and pray.”
7 So Holoferʹnes commanded his guards not to hinder her. And she remained in the camp for three days, and went out each night to the valley of Bethuʹlia, and bathed at the spring in the camp.
8 When she came up from the spring she prayed the Lord God of Israel to direct her way for the raising up of her people.
9 So she returned clean and stayed in the tent until she ate her food toward evening.
### Judith Attends Holofernes’ Banquet
10 On the fourth day Holoferʹnes held a banquet for his slaves only, and did not invite any of his officers.
11 And he said to Bagoʹas, the eunuch who had charge of all his personal affairs, “Go now and persuade the Hebrew woman who is in your care to join us and eat and drink with us.
12 For it will be a disgrace if we let such a woman go without enjoying her company, for if we do not embrace her she will laugh at us.”
13 So Bagoʹas went out from the presence of Holoferʹnes, and approached her and said, “This beautiful maidservant will please come to my lord and be honored in his presence, and drink wine and be merry with us, and become today like one of the daughters of the Assyrians who serve in the house of Nebuchadnezʹzar.”
14 And Judith said, “Who am I, to refuse my lord? Surely whatever pleases him I will do at once, and it will be a joy to me until the day of my death!”
15 So she got up and arrayed herself in all her woman’s finery, and her maid went and spread on the ground for her before Holoferʹnes the soft fleeces which she had received from Bagoʹas for her daily use, so that she might recline on them when she ate.
16 Then Judith came in and lay down, and Holoferʹnes’ heart was ravished with her and he was moved with great desire to possess her; for he had been waiting for an opportunity to deceive her, ever since the day he first saw her.
17 So Holoferʹnes said to her. “Drink now, and be merry with us!”
18 Judith said, “I will drink now, my lord, because my life means more to me today than in all the days since I was born.”
19 Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared.
20 And Holoferʹnes was greatly pleased with her, and drank a great quantity of wine, much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since he was born.


# Liber Judith 12 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Tunc jussit eam introire ubi repositi erant thesauri ejus, et jussit illic manere eam, et constituit quid daretur illi de convivio suo.
2 Cui respondit Judith, et dixit: Nunc non potero manducare ex his quæ mihi præcipis tribui, ne veniat super me offensio: ex his autem quæ mihi detuli, manducabo.
3 Cui Holofernes ait: Si defecerint tibi ista, quæ tecum detulisti, quid faciemus tibi?
4 Et dixit Judith: Vivit anima tua, domine meus, quoniam non expendet omnia hæc ancilla tua, donec faciat Deus in manu mea hæc quæ cogitavi. Et induxerunt illam servi ejus in tabernaculum quod præceperat.
5 Et petiit dum introiret, ut daretur ei copia nocte et ante lucem egrediendi foras ad orationem, et deprecandi Dominum.
6 Et præcepit cubiculariis suis ut sicut placeret illi, exiret et introiret ad adorandum Deum suum per triduum:
7 et exibat noctibus in vallem Bethuliæ, et baptizabat se in fonte aquæ.
8 Et ut ascendebat, orabat Dominum Deum Israël ut dirigeret viam ejus ad liberationem populi sui.
9 Et introiens, munda manebat in tabernaculo usque dum acciperet escam suam in vespere.

10 Et factum est, in quarto die Holofernes fecit cœnam servis suis, et dixit ad Vagao eunuchum suum: Vade, et suade Hebræam illam ut sponte consentiat habitare mecum.
11 Fœdum est enim apud Assyrios, si femina irrideat virum agendo ut immunis ab eo transeat.
12 Tunc introivit Vagao ad Judith, et dixit: Non vereatur bona puella introire ad dominum meum, ut honorificetur ante faciem ejus, ut manducet cum eo, et bibat vinum in jucunditate.
13 Cui Judith respondit: Quæ ego sum, ut contradicam domino meo?
14 omne quod erit ante oculos ejus bonum et optimum, faciam. Quidquid autem illi placuerit, hoc mihi erit optimum omnibus diebus vitæ meæ.
15 Et surrexit, et ornavit se vestimento suo, et ingressa stetit ante faciem ejus.
16 Cor autem Holofernes concussum est: erat enim ardens in concupiscentia ejus.
17 Et dixit ad eam Holofernes: Bibe nunc, et accumbe in jucunditate, quoniam invenisti gratiam coram me.
18 Et dixit Judith: Bibam, domine, quoniam magnificata est anima mea hodie præ omnibus diebus meis.
19 Et accepit, et manducavit et bibit coram ipso ea quæ paraverat illi ancilla ejus.
20 Et jucundus factus est Holofernes ad eam, bibitque vinum multum nimis, quantum numquam biberat in vita sua.


# Ιουδίθ 12 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐκέλευσεν εἰσαγαγεῖν αὐτὴν οὗ ἐτίθετο τὰ ἀργυρώματα αὐτοῦ καὶ συνέταξεν καταστρῶσαι αὐτῇ ἀπὸ τῶν ὀψοποιημάτων αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ οἴνου αὐτοῦ πίνειν
2 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδιθ οὐ φάγομαι ἐξ αὐτῶν ἵνα μὴ γένηται σκάνδαλον ἀλ{L'} ἐκ τῶν ἠκολουθηκότων μοι χορηγηθήσεται
3 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὴν Ολοφέρνης ἐὰν δὲ ἐκλίπῃ τὰ ὄντα μετὰ σοῦ πόθεν ἐξοίσομέν σοι δοῦναι ὅμοια αὐτοῖς οὐ γάρ ἐστιν με{Q'} ἡμῶν ἐκ τοῦ γένους σου
4 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδιθ πρὸς αὐτόν ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου κύριέ μου ὅτι οὐ δαπανήσει ἡ δούλη σου τὰ ὄντα με{T'} ἐμοῦ ἕως ἂν ποιήσῃ κύριος ἐν χειρί μου ἃ ἐβουλεύσατο
5 καὶ ἠγάγοσαν αὐτὴν οἱ θεράποντες Ολοφέρνου εἰς τὴν σκηνήν καὶ ὕπνωσεν μέχρι μεσούσης τῆς νυκτός καὶ ἀνέστη πρὸς τὴν ἑωθινὴν φυλακήν
6 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς Ολοφέρνην λέγουσα ἐπιταξάτω δὴ ὁ κύριός μου ἐᾶσαι τὴν δούλην σου ἐπὶ προσευχὴν ἐξελθεῖν
7 καὶ προσέταξεν Ολοφέρνης τοῖς σωματοφύλαξιν μὴ διακωλύειν αὐτήν καὶ παρέμεινεν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ ἡμέρας τρεῖς καὶ ἐξεπορεύετο κατὰ νύκτα εἰς τὴν φάραγγα Βαιτυλουα καὶ ἐβαπτίζετο ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ ἐπὶ τῆς πηγῆς τοῦ ὕδατος
8 καὶ ὡς ἀνέβη ἐδέετο τοῦ κυρίου θεοῦ Ισραηλ κατευθῦναι τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῆς εἰς ἀνάστημα τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ
9 καὶ εἰσπορευομένη καθαρὰ παρέμενεν ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ μέχρι οὗ προσηνέγκατο τὴν τροφὴν αὐτῆς πρὸς ἑσπέραν

10 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τετάρτῃ ἐποίησεν Ολοφέρνης πότον τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ μόνοις καὶ οὐκ ἐκάλεσεν εἰς τὴν κλῆσιν οὐδένα τῶν πρὸς ταῖς χρείαις
11 καὶ εἶπεν Βαγώᾳ τῷ εὐνούχῳ ὃς ἦν ἐφεστηκὼς ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν αὐτοῦ πεῖσον δὴ πορευθεὶς τὴν γυναῖκα τὴν Εβραίαν ἥ ἐστιν παρὰ σοί τοῦ ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν με{Q'} ἡμῶν
12 ἰδοὺ γὰρ αἰσχρὸν τῷ προσώπῳ ἡμῶν εἰ γυναῖκα τοιαύτην παρήσομεν οὐχ ὁμιλήσαντες αὐτῇ ὅτι ἐὰν ταύτην μὴ ἐπισπασώμεθα καταγελάσεται ἡμῶν
13 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Βαγώας ἀπὸ προσώπου Ολοφέρνου καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτὴν καὶ εἶπεν μὴ ὀκνησάτω δὴ ἡ παιδίσκη ἡ καλὴ αὕτη ἐλθοῦσα πρὸς τὸν κύριόν μου δοξασθῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ καὶ πίεσαι με{Q'} ἡμῶν εἰς εὐφροσύνην οἶνον καὶ γενηθῆναι ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ ὡς θυγάτηρ μία τῶν υἱῶν Ασσουρ αἳ παρεστήκασιν ἐν οἴκῳ Ναβουχοδονοσορ
14 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ιουδιθ καὶ τίς εἰμι ἐγὼ ἀντεροῦσα τῷ κυρίῳ μου ὅτι πᾶν ὃ ἔσται ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ ἀρεστόν σπεύσασα ποιήσω καὶ ἔσται τοῦτό μοι ἀγαλλίαμα ἕως ἡμέρας θανάτου μου
15 καὶ διαναστᾶσα ἐκοσμήθη τῷ ἱματισμῷ καὶ παντὶ τῷ κόσμῳ τῷ γυναικείῳ καὶ προσῆλθεν ἡ δούλη αὐτῆς καὶ ἔστρωσεν αὐτῇ κατέναντι Ολοφέρνου χαμαὶ τὰ κώδια ἃ ἔλαβεν παρὰ Βαγώου εἰς τὴν καθημερινὴν δίαιταν αὐτῆς εἰς τὸ ἐσθίειν κατακλινομένην ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν
16 καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα ἀνέπεσεν Ιουδιθ καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ καρδία Ολοφέρνου ἐ{P'} αὐτήν καὶ ἐσαλεύθη ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἦν κατεπίθυμος σφόδρα τοῦ συγγενέσθαι με{T'} αὐτῆς καὶ ἐτήρει καιρὸν τοῦ ἀπατῆσαι αὐτὴν ἀ{F'} ἧς ἡμέρας εἶδεν αὐτήν
17 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὴν Ολοφέρνης πίε δὴ καὶ γενήθητι με{Q'} ἡμῶν εἰς εὐφροσύνην
18 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδιθ πίομαι δή κύριε ὅτι ἐμεγαλύνθη τὸ ζῆν μου ἐν ἐμοὶ σήμερον παρὰ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς γενέσεώς μου
19 καὶ λαβοῦσα ἔφαγεν καὶ ἔπιεν κατέναντι αὐτοῦ ἃ ἡτοίμασεν ἡ δούλη αὐτῆς
20 καὶ ηὐφράνθη Ολοφέρνης ἀ{P'} αὐτῆς καὶ ἔπιεν οἶνον πολὺν σφόδρα ὅσον οὐκ ἔπιεν πώποτε ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ ἀ{F'} οὗ ἐγεννήθη
