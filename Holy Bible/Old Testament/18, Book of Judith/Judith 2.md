### The Expedition against the West
1 In the eighteenth year, on the twenty-second day of the first month, there was talk in the palace of Nebuchadnezʹzar king of the Assyrians about carrying out his revenge on the whole region, just as he said.
2 He called together all his officers and all his nobles and set forth to them his secret plan and recounted fully, with his own lips, all the wickedness of the region;
3 and it was decided that every one who had not obeyed his command should be destroyed.
4 When he had finished setting forth his plan, Nebuchadnezʹzar king of the Assyrians called Holoferʹnes, the chief general of his army, second only to himself, and said to him,
5 “Thus says the Great King, the lord of the whole earth: When you leave my presence, take with you men confident in their strength, to the number of one hundred and twenty thousand foot soldiers and twelve thousand cavalry.
6 Go and attack the whole west country, because they disobeyed my orders.
7 Tell them to prepare earth and water, for I am coming against them in my anger, and will cover the whole face of the earth with the feet of my armies, and will hand them over to be plundered by my troops,
8 till their wounded shall fill their valleys, and every brook and river shall be filled with their dead, and overflow;
9 and I will lead them away captive to the ends of the whole earth.
10 You shall go and seize all their territory for me in advance. They will yield themselves to you, and you shall hold them for me till the day of their punishment.
11 But if they refuse, your eye shall not spare and you shall hand them over to slaughter and plunder throughout your whole region.
12 For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, what I have spoken my hand will execute.
13 And you—take care not to transgress any of your sovereign’s commands, but be sure to carry them out just as I have ordered you; and do not delay about it.”
### Campaign of Holofernes
14 So Holoferʹnes left the presence of his master, and called together all the commanders, generals, and officers of the Assyrian army,
15 and mustered the picked troops by divisions as his lord had ordered him to do, one hundred and twenty thousand of them, together with twelve thousand archers on horseback,
16 and he organized them as a great army is marshaled for a campaign.
17 He collected a vast number of camels and asses and mules for transport, and innumerable sheep and oxen and goats for provision;
18 also plenty of food for every man, and a huge amount of gold and silver from the royal palace.
19 So he set out with his whole army, to go ahead of King Nebuchadnezʹzar and to cover the whole face of the earth to the west with their chariots and horsemen and picked troops of infantry.
20 Along with them went a mixed crowd like a swarm of locusts, like the dust of the earth—a multitude that could not be counted.
21 They marched for three days from Ninʹeveh to the plain of Bectiʹleth, and camped opposite Bectiʹleth near the mountain which is to the north of Upper Ciliʹcia.
22 From there Holoferʹnes took his whole army, his infantry, cavalry, and chariots, and went up into the hill country
23 and ravaged Put and Lud, and plundered all the people of Rassis and the Ishʹmaelites who lived along the desert, south of the country of the Chelʹleans.
24 Then he followed the Euphraʹtes and passed through Mesopotaʹmia and destroyed all the hilltop cities along the brook Abron, as far as the sea.
25 He also seized the territory of Ciliʹcia, and killed every one who resisted him, and came to the southern borders of Japheth, fronting toward Arabia.
26 He surrounded all the Midʹianites, and burned their tents and plundered their sheepfolds.
27 Then he went down into the plain of Damasʹcus during the wheat harvest, and burned all their fields and destroyed their flocks and herds and sacked their cities and ravaged their lands and put to death all their young men with the edge of the sword.
28 So fear and terror of him fell upon all the people who lived along the seacoast, at Sidon and Tyre, and those who lived in Sur and Ociʹna and all who lived in Jamʹnia. Those who lived in Azoʹtus and Asʹcalon feared him exceedingly.


# Liber Judith 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno tertiodecimo Nabuchodonosor regis, vigesima et secunda die mensis primi, factum est verbum in domo Nabuchodonosor regis Assyriorum ut defenderet se.
2 Vocavitque omnes majores natu, omnesque duces et bellatores suos, et habuit cum eis mysterium consilii sui:
3 dixitque cogitationem suam in eo esse, ut omnem terram suo subjugaret imperio.
4 Quod dictum cum placuisset omnibus, vocavit Nabuchodonosor rex Holofernem principem militiæ suæ,
5 et dixit ei: Egredere adversus omne regnum occidentis, et contra eos præcipue, qui contempserunt imperium eum.
6 Non parcet oculus tuus ulli regno, omnemque urbem munitam subjugabis mihi.

7 Tunc Holofernes vocavit duces et magistratus virtutis Assyriorum, et dinumeravit viros in expeditionem sicut præcepit ei rex, centum viginti millia peditum pugnatorum, et equitum sagittariorum duodecim millia.
8 Omnemque expeditionem suam fecit præire in multitudine innumerabilium camelorum, cum his quæ exercitibus sufficerent copiose, boum quoque armenta, gregesque ovium, quorum non erat numerus.
9 Frumentum ex omni Syria in transitu suo parari constituit.
10 Aurum vero et argentum de domo regis assumpsit multum nimis.

11 Et profectus est ipse, et omnis exercitus cum quadrigis, et equitibus, et sagittariis: qui cooperuerunt faciem terræ sicut locustæ.

12 Cumque pertransisset fines Assyriorum, venit ad magnos montes Ange, qui sunt a sinistro Ciliciæ: ascenditque omnia castella eorum, et obtinuit omnem munitionem.
13 Effregit autem civitatem opinatissimam Melothi, prædavitque omnes filios Tharsis et filios Ismaël qui erant contra faciem deserti, et ad austrum terræ Cellon.
14 Et transivit Euphraten, et venit in Mesopotamiam: et fregit omnes civitates excelsas quæ erant ibi, a torrente Mambre usquequo perveniatur ad mare:
15 et occupavit terminos ejus, a Cilicia usque ad fines Japheth qui sunt ad austrum.
16 Abduxitque omnes filios Madian, et prædavit omnem locupletationem eorum, omnesque resistentes sibi occidit in ore gladii.
17 Et post hæc descendit in campos Damasci in diebus messis, et succendit omnia sata, omnesque arbores, et vineas fecit incidi:
18 et cecidit timor illius super omnes inhabitantes terram.

1 καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῳ δευτέρᾳ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ πρώτου μηνὸς ἐγένετο λόγος ἐν οἴκῳ Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων ἐκδικῆσαι πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν καθὼς ἐλάλησεν
2 καὶ συνεκάλεσεν πάντας τοὺς θεράποντας αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντας τοὺς μεγιστᾶνας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔθετο με{T'} αὐτῶν τὸ μυστήριον τῆς βουλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ συνετέλεσεν πᾶσαν τὴν κακίαν τῆς γῆς ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ
3 καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔκριναν ὀλεθρεῦσαι πᾶσαν σάρκα οἳ οὐκ ἠκολούθησαν τῷ λόγῳ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ
4 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς συνετέλεσεν τὴν βουλὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκάλεσεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων τὸν Ολοφέρνην ἀρχιστράτηγον τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ δεύτερον ὄντα με{T'} αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν
5 τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ μέγας ὁ κύριος πάσης τῆς γῆς ἰδοὺ σὺ ἐξελεύσῃ ἐκ τοῦ προσώπου μου καὶ λήμψῃ μετὰ σεαυτοῦ ἄνδρας πεποιθότας ἐν ἰσχύι αὐτῶν πεζῶν εἰς χιλιάδας ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι καὶ πλῆθος ἵππων σὺν ἀναβάταις χιλιάδας δέκα δύο
6 καὶ ἐξελεύσῃ εἰς συνάντησιν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ ἐπὶ δυσμάς ὅτι ἠπείθησαν τῷ ῥήματι τοῦ στόματός μου

7 καὶ ἀπαγγελεῖς αὐτοῖς ἑτοιμάζειν γῆν καὶ ὕδωρ ὅτι ἐξελεύσομαι ἐν θυμῷ μου ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς καὶ καλύψω πᾶν τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς ἐν τοῖς ποσὶν τῆς δυνάμεώς μου καὶ δώσω αὐτοὺς εἰς διαρπαγὴν αὐτοῖς
8 καὶ οἱ τραυματίαι αὐτῶν πληρώσουσιν τὰς φάραγγας αὐτῶν καὶ πᾶς χειμάρρους καὶ ποταμὸς ἐπικλύζων τοῖς νεκροῖς αὐτῶν πληρωθήσεται
9 καὶ ἄξω τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὰ ἄκρα πάσης τῆς γῆς
10 σὺ δὲ ἐξελθὼν προκαταλήμψῃ μοι πᾶν ὅριον αὐτῶν καὶ ἐκδώσουσίν σοι ἑαυτούς καὶ διατηρήσεις ἐμοὶ αὐτοὺς εἰς ἡμέραν ἐλεγμοῦ αὐτῶν

11 ἐπὶ δὲ τοὺς ἀπειθοῦντας οὐ φείσεται ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου τοῦ δοῦναι αὐτοὺς εἰς φόνον καὶ ἁρπαγὴν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ σου

12 ὅτι ζῶν ἐγὼ καὶ τὸ κράτος τῆς βασιλείας μου λελάληκα καὶ ποιήσω ταῦτα ἐν χειρί μου
13 καὶ σὺ δὲ οὐ παραβήσῃ ἕν τι τῶν ῥημάτων τοῦ κυρίου σου ἀλλὰ ἐπιτελῶν ἐπιτελέσεις καθότι προστέταχά σοι καὶ οὐ μακρυνεῖς τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτά
14 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ολοφέρνης ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν πάντας τοὺς δυνάστας καὶ τοὺς στρατηγοὺς καὶ ἐπιστάτας τῆς δυνάμεως Ασσουρ
15 καὶ ἠρίθμησεν ἐκλεκτοὺς ἄνδρας εἰς παράταξιν καθότι ἐκέλευσεν αὐτῷ ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ εἰς μυριάδας δέκα δύο καὶ ἱππεῖς τοξότας μυρίους δισχιλίους
16 καὶ διέταξεν αὐτοὺς ὃν τρόπον πολέμου πλῆθος συντάσσεται
17 καὶ ἔλαβεν καμήλους καὶ ὄνους καὶ ἡμιόνους εἰς τὴν ἀπαρτίαν αὐτῶν πλῆθος πολὺ σφόδρα καὶ πρόβατα καὶ βόας καὶ αἶγας εἰς τὴν παρασκευὴν αὐτῶν ὧν οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμός
18 καὶ ἐπισιτισμὸν παντὶ ἀνδρὶ εἰς πλῆθος καὶ χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον ἐξ οἴκου βασιλέως πολὺ σφόδρα
