# Book of Judith 4 (RSVCE)

### Judea on the Alert
1 By this time the people of Israel living in Judea heard of everything that Holoferʹnes, the general of Nebuchadnezʹzar the king of the Assyrians, had done to the nations, and how he had plundered and destroyed all their temples;
2 they were therefore very greatly terrified at his approach, and were alarmed both for Jerusalem and for the temple of the Lord their God.
3 For they had only recently returned from the captivity, and all the people of Judea were newly gathered together, and the sacred vessels and the altar and the temple had been consecrated after their profanation.
4 So they sent to every district of Samarʹia, and to Kona and Beth-horʹon and Belmaʹin and Jericho and to Choba and Aesorʹa and the valley of Salem,
5 and immediately seized all the high hilltops and fortified the villages on them and stored up food in preparation for war—since their fields had recently been harvested.
6 And Joʹakim, the high priest, who was in Jerusalem at the time, wrote to the people of Bethuʹlia and Betomesthaʹim, which faces Esdraeʹlon opposite the plain near Dothan,
7 ordering them to seize the passes up into the hills, since by them Judea could be invaded, and it was easy to stop any who tried to enter, for the approach was narrow, only wide enough for two men at the most.
### Prayer and Penance
8 So the Israelites did as Joʹakim the high priest and the senate of the whole people of Israel, in session at Jerusalem, had given order.
9 And every man of Israel cried out to God with great fervor, and they humbled themselves with much fasting.
10 They and their wives and their children and their cattle and every resident alien and hired laborer and purchased slave—they all girded themselves with sackcloth.
11 And all the men and women of Israel, and their children, living at Jerusalem, prostrated themselves before the temple and put ashes on their heads and spread out their sackcloth before the Lord.
12 They even surrounded the altar with sackcloth and cried out in unison, praying earnestly to the God of Israel not to give up their infants as prey and their wives as booty, and the cities they had inherited to be destroyed, and the sanctuary to be profaned and desecrated to the malicious joy of the Gentiles.
13 So the Lord heard their prayers and looked upon their affliction; for the people fasted many days throughout Judea and in Jerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.
14 And Joʹakim the high priest and all the priests who stood before the Lord and ministered to the Lord, with their loins girded with sackcloth, offered the continual burnt offerings and the vows and freewill offerings of the people.
15 With ashes upon their turbans, they cried out to the Lord with all their might to look with favor upon the whole house of Israel.


# Liber Judith 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Tunc audientes hæc filii Israël qui habitabant in terra Juda, timuerunt valde a facie ejus.
2 Tremor et horror invasit sensus eorum, ne hoc faceret Jerusalem et templo Domini, quod fecerat ceteris civitatibus et templis earum.
3 Et miserunt in omnem Samariam per circuitum usque Jericho, et præoccupaverunt omnes vertices montium:
4 et muris circumdederunt vicos suos, et congregaverunt frumenta in præparationem pugnæ.
5 Sacerdos etiam Eliachim scripsit ad universos qui erant contra Esdrelon, quæ est contra faciem campi magni juxta Dothain, et universos per quos viæ transitus esse poterat,
6 ut obtinerent ascensus montium, per quos via esse poterat ad Jerusalem, et illic custodirent ubi angustum iter esse poterat inter montes.
7 Et fecerunt filii Israël secundum quod constituerat eis sacerdos Domini Eliachim.

8 Et clamavit omnis populus ad Dominum instantia magna, et humiliaverunt animas suas in jejuniis et orationibus, ipsi et mulieres eorum.
9 Et induerunt se sacerdotes ciliciis, et infantes prostraverunt contra faciem templi Domini, et altare Domini operuerunt cilicio:
10 et clamaverunt ad Dominum Deum Israël unanimiter ne darentur in prædam infantes eorum, et uxores eorum in divisionem, et civitates eorum in exterminium, et sancta eorum in pollutionem, et fierent opprobrium gentibus.
11 Tunc Eliachim sacerdos Domini magnus circuivit omnem Israël, allocutusque est eos,
12 dicens: Scitote quoniam exaudiet Dominus preces vestras, si manentes permanseritis in jejuniis et orationibus in conspectu Domini.
13 Memores estote Moysi servi Domini, qui Amalec confidentem in virtute sua, et in potentia sua, et in exercitu suo, et in clypeis suis, et in curribus suis, et in equitibus suis, non ferro pugnando, sed precibus sanctis orando dejecit:
14 sic erunt universi hostes Israël, si perseveraveritis in hoc opere quod cœpistis.
15 Ad hanc igitur exhortationem ejus deprecantes Dominum, permanebant in conspectu Domini,
16 ita ut etiam hi qui offerebant Domino holocausta, præcincti ciliciis offerrent sacrificia Domino, et erat cinis super capita eorum.
17 Et ex toto corde suo omnes orabant Deum, ut visitaret populum suum Israël.


# Ιουδίθ 4 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ολοφέρνης τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων καὶ ὃν τρόπον ἐσκύλευσεν πάντα τὰ ἱερὰ αὐτῶν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ εἰς ἀφανισμόν
2 καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα σφόδρα ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ καὶ περὶ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ τοῦ ναοῦ κυρίου θεοῦ αὐτῶν ἐταράχθησαν
3 ὅτι προσφάτως ἦσαν ἀναβεβηκότες ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας καὶ νεωστὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς συνελέλεκτο τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ τὰ σκεύη καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον καὶ ὁ οἶκος ἐκ τῆς βεβηλώσεως ἡγιασμένα ἦν
4 καὶ ἀπέστειλαν εἰς πᾶν ὅριον Σαμαρείας καὶ Κωνα καὶ Βαιθωρων καὶ Βελμαιν καὶ Ιεριχω καὶ εἰς Χωβα καὶ Αισωρα καὶ τὸν αὐλῶνα Σαλημ
5 καὶ προκατελάβοντο πάσας τὰς κορυφὰς τῶν ὀρέων τῶν ὑψηλῶν καὶ ἐτείχισαν τὰς ἐν αὐτοῖς κώμας καὶ παρέθεντο εἰς ἐπισιτισμὸν εἰς παρασκευὴν πολέμου ὅτι προσφάτως ἦν τὰ πεδία αὐτῶν τεθερισμένα
6 καὶ ἔγραψεν Ιωακιμ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας ὃς ἦν ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐν Ιερουσαλημ τοῖς κατοικοῦσι Βαιτυλουα καὶ Βαιτομεσθαιμ ἥ ἐστιν ἀπέναντι Εσδρηλων κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ πεδίου τοῦ πλησίον Δωθαϊμ
7 λέγων διακατασχεῖν τὰς ἀναβάσεις τῆς ὀρεινῆς ὅτι δ{I'} αὐτῶν ἦν ἡ εἴσοδος εἰς τὴν Ιουδαίαν καὶ ἦν εὐχερῶς διακωλῦσαι αὐτοὺς προσβαίνοντας στενῆς τῆς προσβάσεως οὔσης ἐ{P'} ἄνδρας τοὺς πάντας δύο

8 καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ καθὰ συνέταξεν αὐτοῖς Ιωακιμ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας καὶ ἡ γερουσία παντὸς δήμου Ισραηλ οἳ ἐκάθηντο ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
9 καὶ ἀνεβόησαν πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ἐν ἐκτενείᾳ μεγάλῃ καὶ ἐταπείνωσαν τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν ἐν ἐκτενείᾳ μεγάλῃ
10 αὐτοὶ καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ νήπια αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν καὶ πᾶς πάροικος καὶ μισθωτὸς καὶ ἀργυρώνητος αὐτῶν ἐπέθεντο σάκκους ἐπὶ τὰς ὀσφύας αὐτῶν
11 καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ καὶ γυνὴ καὶ τὰ παιδία οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἔπεσον κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ναοῦ καὶ ἐσποδώσαντο τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν καὶ ἐξέτειναν τοὺς σάκκους αὐτῶν κατὰ πρόσωπον κυρίου
12 καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον σάκκῳ περιέβαλον καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς τὸν θεὸν Ισραηλ ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἐκτενῶς τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι εἰς διαρπαγὴν τὰ νήπια αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας εἰς προνομὴν καὶ τὰς πόλεις τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτῶν εἰς ἀφανισμὸν καὶ τὰ ἅγια εἰς βεβήλωσιν καὶ ὀνειδισμὸν ἐπίχαρμα τοῖς ἔθνεσιν
13 καὶ εἰσήκουσεν κύριος τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν καὶ εἰσεῖδεν τὴν θλῖψιν αὐτῶν καὶ ἦν ὁ λαὸς νηστεύων ἡμέρας πλείους ἐν πάσῃ τῇ Ιουδαίᾳ καὶ Ιερουσαλημ κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἁγίων κυρίου παντοκράτορος
14 καὶ Ιωακιμ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας καὶ πάντες οἱ παρεστηκότες ἐνώπιον κυρίου ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ λειτουργοῦντες κυρίῳ σάκκους περιεζωσμένοι τὰς ὀσφύας αὐτῶν προσέφερον τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν τοῦ ἐνδελεχισμοῦ καὶ τὰς εὐχὰς καὶ τὰ ἑκούσια δόματα τοῦ λαοῦ
15 καὶ ἦν σποδὸς ἐπὶ τὰς κιδάρεις αὐτῶν καὶ ἐβόων πρὸς κύριον ἐκ πάσης δυνάμεως εἰς ἀγαθὸν ἐπισκέψασθαι πᾶν οἶκον Ισραηλ
