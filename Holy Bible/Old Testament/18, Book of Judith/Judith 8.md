# Book of Judith 8 (RSVCE)

### The Character of Judith
1 At that time Judith heard about these things: she was the daughter of Merarʹi the son of Ox, son of Joseph, son of Oʹziel, son of Elkiʹah, son of Ananiʹas, son of Gidʹeon, son of Raphʹa-im, son of Ahiʹtub, son of Eliʹjah, son of Hilkiʹah, son of Elʹiab, son of Nathanʹael, son of Salamʹiel, son of Sarasadʹai, son of Israel.
2 Her husband Manasʹseh, who belonged to her tribe and family, had died during the barley harvest.
3 For as he stood overseeing the men who were binding sheaves in the field, he was overcome by the burning heat, and took to his bed and died in Bethuʹlia his city. So they buried him with his fathers in the field between Dothan and Balaʹmon.
4 Judith had lived at home as a widow for three years and four months.
5 She set up a tent for herself on the roof of her house, and girded sackcloth about her loins and wore the garments of her widowhood.
6 She fasted all the days of her widowhood, except the day before the sabbath and the sabbath itself, the day before the new moon and the day of the new moon, and the feasts and days of rejoicing of the house of Israel.
7 She was beautiful in appearance, and had a very lovely face; and her husband Manasʹseh had left her gold and silver, and men and women slaves, and cattle, and fields; and she maintained this estate.
8 No one spoke ill of her, for she feared God with great devotion.
### Judith and the Elders
9 When Judith heard the wicked words spoken by the people against the ruler, because they were faint for lack of water, and when she heard all that Uzziʹah said to them, and how he promised them under oath to surrender the city to the Assyrians after five days,
10 she sent her maid, who was in charge of all she possessed, to summon Chabris and Charmis, the elders of her city.
11 They came to her, and she said to them, “Listen to me, rulers of the people of Bethuʹlia! What you have said to the people today is not right; you have even sworn and pronounced this oath between God and you, promising to surrender the city to our enemies unless the Lord turns and helps us within so many days.
12 Who are you, that have put God to the test this day, and are setting yourselves up in the place of God among the sons of men?
13 You are putting the Lord Almighty to the test—but you will never know anything!
14 You cannot plumb the depths of the human heart, nor find out what a man is thinking; how do you expect to search out God, who made all these things, and find out his mind or comprehend his thought? No, my brethren, do not provoke the Lord our God to anger.
15 For if he does not choose to help us within these five days, he has power to protect us within any time he pleases, or even to destroy us in the presence of our enemies.
16 Do not try to bind the purposes of the Lord our God; for God is not like man, to be threatened, nor like a human being, to be won over by pleading.
17 Therefore, while we wait for his deliverance, let us call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it pleases him.
18 “For never in our generation, nor in these present days, has there been any tribe or family or people or city of ours which worshiped gods made with hands, as was done in days gone by—
19 and that was why our fathers were handed over to the sword, and to be plundered, and so they suffered a great catastrophe before our enemies.
20 But we know no other god but him, and therefore we hope that he will not disdain us or any of our nation.
21 For if we are captured all Judea will be captured and our sanctuary will be plundered; and he will exact of us the penalty for its desecration.
22 And the slaughter of our brethren and the captivity of the land and the desolation of our inheritance—all this he will bring upon our heads among the Gentiles, wherever we serve as slaves; and we shall be an offense and a reproach in the eyes of those who acquire us.
23 For our slavery will not bring us into favor, but the Lord our God will turn it to dishonor.
24 “Now therefore, brethren, let us set an example to our brethren, for their lives depend upon us, and the sanctuary and the temple and the altar rest upon us.
25 In spite of everything let us give thanks to the Lord our God, who is putting us to the test as he did our forefathers.
26 Remember what he did with Abraham, and how he tested Isaac, and what happened to Jacob in Mesopotaʹmia in Syria, while he was keeping the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother.
27 For he has not tried us with fire, as he did them, to search their hearts, nor has he taken revenge upon us; but the Lord scourges those who draw near to him, in order to admonish them.”
28 Then Uzziʹah said to her, “All that you have said has been spoken out of a true heart, and there is no one who can deny your words.
29 Today is not the first time your wisdom has been shown, but from the beginning of your life all the people have recognized your understanding, for your heart’s disposition is right.
30 But the people were very thirsty, and they compelled us to do for them what we have promised, and made us take an oath which we cannot break.
31 So pray for us, since you are a devout woman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns and we will no longer be faint.”
32 Judith said to them, “Listen to me. I am about to do a thing which will go down through all generations of our descendants.
33 Stand at the city gate tonight, and I will go out with my maid; and within the days after which you have promised to surrender the city to our enemies, the Lord will deliver Israel by my hand.
34 Only, do not try to find out what I plan; for I will not tell you until I have finished what I am about to do.”
35 Uzziʹah and the rulers said to her, “Go in peace, and may the Lord God go before you, to take revenge upon our enemies.”
36 So they returned from the tent and went to their posts.


# Liber Judith 8 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et factum est cum audisset hæc verba Judith vidua, quæ erat filia Merari filii Idox filii Joseph filii Oziæ filii Elai filii Jamnor filii Gedeon filii Raphaim filii Achitob filii Melchiæ filii Enan filii Nathaniæ filii Salathiel filii Simeon filii Ruben,
2 et vir ejus fuit Manasses, qui mortuus est in diebus messis hordeaceæ:
3 instabat enim super alligantes manipulos in campo, et venit æstus super caput ejus, et mortuus est in Bethulia civitate sua, et sepultus est illic cum patribus suis.
4 Erat autem Judith relicta ejus vidua jam annis tribus et mensibus sex.
5 Et in superioribus domus suæ fecit sibi secretum cubiculum, in quo cum puellis suis clausa morabatur,
6 et habens super lumbos suos cilicium, jejunabat omnibus diebus vitæ suæ, præter sabbata et neomenias et festa domus Israël.
7 Erat autem eleganti aspectu nimis, cui vir suus reliquerat divitias multas, et familiam copiosam, ac possessiones armentis boum, et gregibus ovium plenas.
8 Et erat hæc in omnibus famosissima, quoniam timebat Dominum valde, nec erat qui loqueretur de illa verbum malum.

9 Hæc itaque cum audisset quoniam Ozias promisisset quod transacto quinto die traderet civitatem, misit ad presbyteros Chabri et Charmi.
10 Et venerunt ad illam, et dixit illis: Quod est hoc verbum, in quo consensit Ozias, ut tradat civitatem Assyriis si intra quinque dies non venerit vobis adjutorium?
11 et qui estis vos, qui tentatis Dominum?
12 non est iste sermo qui misericordiam provocet, sed potius qui iram excitet, et furorem accendat.
13 Posuistis vos tempus miserationis Domini, et in arbitrium vestrum, diem constituistis ei.
14 Sed quia patiens Dominus est, in hoc ipso pœniteamus, et indulgentiam ejus fusis lacrimis postulemus:
15 non enim quasi homo sic Deus comminabitur, neque sicut filius hominis ad iracundiam inflammabitur.
16 Et ideo humiliemus illi animas nostras, et in spiritu constituti humiliato, servientes illi
17 dicamus flentes Domino, ut secundum voluntatem suam sic faciat nobiscum misericordiam suam: ut sicut conturbatum est cor nostrum in superbia eorum, ita etiam de nostra humilitate gloriemur:
18 quoniam non sumus secuti peccata patrum nostrorum, qui dereliquerunt Deum suum, et adoraverunt deos alienos,
19 pro quo scelere dati sunt in gladium, et in rapinam, et in confusionem inimicis suis: nos autem alterum deum nescimus præter ipsum.
20 Expectemus humiles consolationem ejus, et exquiret sanguinem nostrum de afflictionibus inimicorum nostrorum, et humiliabit omnes gentes, quæcumque insurgunt contra nos, et faciet illas sine honore Dominus Deus noster.

21 Et nunc fratres, quoniam vos estis presbyteri in populo Dei, et ex vobis pendet anima illorum, ad eloquium vestrum corda eorum erigite, ut memores sint quia tentati sunt patres nostri, ut probarentur si vere colerent Deum suum.
22 Memores esse debent quomodo pater noster Abraham tentatus est, et per multas tribulationes probatus, Dei amicus effectus est.
23 Sic Isaac, sic Jacob, sic Moyses, et omnes qui placuerunt Deo, per multas tribulationes transierunt fideles.
24 Illi autem qui tentationes non susceperunt cum timore Domini, et impatientiam suam et improperium murmurationis suæ contra Dominum protulerunt,
25 exterminati sunt ab exterminatore, et a serpentibus perierunt.
26 Et nos ergo non ulciscamur nos pro his quæ patimur,
27 sed reputantes peccatis nostris hæc ipsa supplicia minora esse flagella Domini, quibus quasi servi corripimur ad emendationem, et non ad perditionem nostram evenisse credamus.

28 Et dixerunt illi Ozias et presbyteri: Omnia quæ locuta es, vera sunt, et non est in sermonibus tuis ulla reprehensio.
29 Nunc ergo ora pro nobis, quoniam mulier sancta es, et timens Deum.
30 Et dixit illis Judith: Sicut quod potui loqui, Dei esse cognoscitis,
31 ita quod facere disposui, probate si ex Deo est, et orate ut firmum faciat Deus consilium meum.
32 Stabitis vos ad portam nocte ista, et ego exeam cum abra mea: et orate, ut sicut dixistis, in diebus quinque respiciat Dominus populum suum Israël.
33 Vos autem nolo ut scrutemini actum meum, et usque dum renuntiem vobis, nihil aliud fiat, nisi oratio pro me ad Dominum Deum nostrum.
34 Et dixit ad eam Ozias princeps Juda: Vade in pace, et Dominus sit tecum in ultionem inimicorum nostrorum. Et revertentes abierunt.

4 καὶ ἦν Ιουδιθ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτῆς χηρεύουσα ἔτη τρία καὶ μῆνας τέσσαρας
5 καὶ ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῇ σκηνὴν ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος τοῦ οἴκου αὐτῆς καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτῆς σάκκον καὶ ἦν ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς χηρεύσεως αὐτῆς

9 καὶ ἤκουσεν τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ λαοῦ τὰ πονηρὰ ἐπὶ τὸν ἄρχοντα ὅτι ὠλιγοψύχησαν ἐν τῇ σπάνει τῶν ὑδάτων καὶ ἤκουσεν πάντας τοὺς λόγους Ιουδιθ οὓς ἐλάλησεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Οζιας ὡς ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς παραδώσειν τὴν πόλιν μετὰ ἡμέρας πέντε τοῖς Ἀσσυρίοις
10 καὶ ἀποστείλασα τὴν ἅβραν αὐτῆς τὴν ἐφεστῶσαν πᾶσιν τοῖς ὑπάρχουσιν αὐτῆς ἐκάλεσεν Χαβριν καὶ Χαρμιν τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς πόλεως αὐτῆς
11 καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτήν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς ἀκούσατε δή μου ἄρχοντες τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν Βαιτυλουα ὅτι οὐκ εὐθὴς ὁ λόγος ὑμῶν ὃν ἐλαλήσατε ἐναντίον τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ καὶ ἐστήσατε τὸν ὅρκον τοῦτον ὃν ἐλαλήσατε ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ὑμῶν καὶ εἴπατε ἐκδώσειν τὴν πόλιν τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ἡμῶν ἐὰν μὴ ἐν αὐταῖς ἐπιστρέψῃ κύριος βοήθειαν ὑμῖν
12 καὶ νῦν τίνες ἐστὲ ὑμεῖς οἳ ἐπειράσατε τὸν θεὸν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ σήμερον καὶ ἵστατε ὑπὲρ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν ἀνθρώπων
13 καὶ νῦν κύριον παντοκράτορα ἐξετάζετε καὶ οὐθὲν ἐπιγνώσεσθε ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος
14 ὅτι βάθος καρδίας ἀνθρώπου οὐχ εὑρήσετε καὶ λόγους τῆς διανοίας αὐτοῦ οὐ διαλήμψεσθε καὶ πῶς τὸν θεόν ὃς ἐποίησεν πάντα ταῦτα ἐρευνήσετε καὶ τὸν νοῦν αὐτοῦ ἐπιγνώσεσθε καὶ τὸν λογισμὸν αὐτοῦ κατανοήσετε μηδαμῶς ἀδελφοί μὴ παροργίζετε κύριον τὸν θεὸν ἡμῶν
15 ὅτι ἐὰν μὴ βούληται ἐν ταῖς πέντε ἡμέραις βοηθῆσαι ἡμῖν αὐτὸς ἔχει τὴν ἐξουσίαν ἐν αἷς θέλει σκεπάσαι ἡμέραις ἢ καὶ ὀλεθρεῦσαι ἡμᾶς πρὸ προσώπου τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν
16 ὑμεῖς δὲ μὴ ἐνεχυράζετε τὰς βουλὰς κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν ὅτι οὐχ ὡς ἄνθρωπος ὁ θεὸς ἀπειληθῆναι οὐ{D'} ὡς υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου διαιτηθῆναι
17 διόπερ ἀναμένοντες τὴν πα{R'} αὐτοῦ σωτηρίαν ἐπικαλεσώμεθα αὐτὸν εἰς βοήθειαν ἡμῶν καὶ εἰσακούσεται τῆς φωνῆς ἡμῶν ἐὰν ᾖ αὐτῷ ἀρεστόν
18 ὅτι οὐκ ἀνέστη ἐν ταῖς γενεαῖς ἡμῶν οὐδέ ἐστιν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ σήμερον οὔτε φυλὴ οὔτε πατριὰ οὔτε δῆμος οὔτε πόλις ἐξ ἡμῶν οἳ προσκυνοῦσι θεοῖς χειροποιήτοις καθάπερ ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς πρότερον ἡμέραις

21 ὅτι ἐν τῷ λημφθῆναι ἡμᾶς οὕτως καὶ λημφθήσεται πᾶσα ἡ Ιουδαία καὶ προνομευθήσεται τὰ ἅγια ἡμῶν καὶ ἐκζητήσει τὴν βεβήλωσιν αὐτῶν ἐκ τοῦ αἵματος ἡμῶν
22 καὶ τὸν φόνον τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν καὶ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τῆς γῆς καὶ τὴν ἐρήμωσιν τῆς κληρονομίας ἡμῶν ἐπιστρέψει εἰς κεφαλὴν ἡμῶν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν οὗ ἐὰν δουλεύσωμεν ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐσόμεθα εἰς πρόσκομμα καὶ εἰς ὄνειδος ἐναντίον τῶν κτωμένων ἡμᾶς

24 καὶ νῦν ἀδελφοί ἐπιδειξώμεθα τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἡμῶν ὅτι ἐξ ἡμῶν κρέμαται ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἅγια καὶ ὁ οἶκος καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐπεστήρισται ἐ{F'} ἡμῖν
25 παρὰ ταῦτα πάντα εὐχαριστήσωμεν κυρίῳ τῷ θεῷ ἡμῶν ὃς πειράζει ἡμᾶς καθὰ καὶ τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν
26 μνήσθητε ὅσα ἐποίησεν μετὰ Αβρααμ καὶ ὅσα ἐπείρασεν τὸν Ισαακ καὶ ὅσα ἐγένετο τῷ Ιακωβ ἐν Μεσοποταμίᾳ τῆς Συρίας ποιμαίνοντι τὰ πρόβατα Λαβαν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ
27 ὅτι οὐ καθὼς ἐκείνους ἐπύρωσεν εἰς ἐτασμὸν τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν καὶ ἡμᾶς οὐκ ἐξεδίκησεν ἀλ{L'} εἰς νουθέτησιν μαστιγοῖ κύριος τοὺς ἐγγίζοντας αὐτῷ

28 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὴν Οζιας πάντα ὅσα εἶπας ἐν ἀγαθῇ καρδίᾳ ἐλάλησας καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἀντιστήσεται τοῖς λόγοις σου
29 ὅτι οὐκ ἐν τῇ σήμερον ἡ σοφία σου πρόδηλός ἐστιν ἀλ{L'} ἀ{P'} ἀρχῆς ἡμερῶν σου ἔγνω πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὴν σύνεσίν σου καθότι ἀγαθόν ἐστιν τὸ πλάσμα τῆς καρδίας σου
30 ἀλλὰ ὁ λαὸς δεδίψηκεν σφόδρα καὶ ἠνάγκασαν ἡμᾶς ποιῆσαι καθὰ ἐλαλήσαμεν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐπαγαγεῖν ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς ὅρκον ὃν οὐ παραβησόμεθα
31 καὶ νῦν δεήθητι περὶ ἡμῶν ὅτι γυνὴ εὐσεβὴς εἶ καὶ ἀποστελεῖ κύριος τὸν ὑετὸν εἰς πλήρωσιν τῶν λάκκων ἡμῶν καὶ οὐκ ἐκλείψομεν ἔτι
32 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ιουδιθ ἀκούσατέ μου καὶ ποιήσω πρᾶγμα ὃ ἀφίξεται εἰς γενεὰς γενεῶν υἱοῖς τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν
33 ὑμεῖς στήσεσθε ἐπὶ τῆς πύλης τὴν νύκτα ταύτην καὶ ἐξελεύσομαι ἐγὼ μετὰ τῆς ἅβρας μου καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις με{Q'} ἃς εἴπατε παραδώσειν τὴν πόλιν τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ἡμῶν ἐπισκέψεται κύριος τὸν Ισραηλ ἐν χειρί μου
34 ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐκ ἐξερευνήσετε τὴν πρᾶξίν μου οὐ γὰρ ἐρῶ ὑμῖν ἕως τοῦ τελεσθῆναι ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ
