# Book of Judith 15 (RSVCE)

### The Assyrians Flee in Panic
1 When the men in the tents heard it, they were amazed at what had happened.
2 Fear and trembling came over them, so that they did not wait for one another, but with one impulse all rushed out and fled by every path across the plain and through the hill country.
3 Those who had camped in the hills around Bethuʹlia also took to flight. Then the men of Israel, every one that was a soldier, rushed out upon them.
4 And Uzziʹah sent men to Betomasthaʹim and Beʹbai and Choba and Kola, and to all the frontiers of Israel, to tell what had taken place and to urge all to rush out upon their enemies to destroy them.
5 And when the Israelites heard it, with one accord they fell upon the enemy, and cut them down as far as Choba. Those in Jerusalem and all the hill country also came, for they were told what had happened in the camp of the enemy; and those in Gilʹead and in Galilee outflanked them with great slaughter, even beyond Damasʹcus and its borders.
6 The rest of the people of Bethuʹlia fell upon the Assyrian camp and plundered it, and were greatly enriched.
7 And the Israelites, when they returned from the slaughter, took possession of what remained, and the villages and towns in the hill country and in the plain got a great amount of booty, for there was a vast quantity of it.
### The Israelites Celebrate Their Victory
8 Then Joʹakim the high priest, and the senate of the people of Israel who lived at Jerusalem, came to witness the good things which the Lord had done for Israel, and to see Judith and to greet her.
9 And when they met her they all blessed her with one accord and said to her, “You are the exaltation of Jerusalem, you are the great glory of Israel, you are the great pride of our nation!
10 You have done all this singlehanded; you have done great good to Israel, and God is well pleased with it. May the Almighty Lord bless you for ever!” And all the people said, “So be it!”
11 So all the people plundered the camp for thirty days. They gave Judith the tent of Holoferʹnes and all his silver dishes and his beds and his bowls and all his furniture; and she took them and loaded her mule and hitched up her carts and piled the things on them.
12 Then all the women of Israel gathered to see her, and blessed her, and some of them performed a dance for her; and she took branches in her hands and gave them to the women who were with her;
13 and they crowned themselves with olive wreaths, she and those who were with her; and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women, while all the men of Israel followed, bearing their arms and wearing garlands and with songs on their lips.


# Liber Judith 15 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Cumque omnis exercitus decollatum Holofernem audisset, fugit mens et consilium ab eis, et solo tremore et metu agitati, fugæ præsidium sumunt,
2 ita ut nullus loqueretur cum proximo suo, sed inclinato capite, relictis omnibus, evadere festinabant Hebræos, quos armatos super se venire audiebant, fugientes per vias camporum et semitas collium.
3 Videntes itaque filii Israël fugientes, secuti sunt illos. Descenderuntque clangentes tubis, et ululantes post ipsos.
4 Et quoniam Assyrii non adunati, in fugam ibant præcipites: filii autem Israël uno agmine persequentes debilitabant omnes quos invenire potuissent.
5 Misit itaque Ozias nuntios per omnes civitates et regiones Israël.
6 Omnis itaque regio, omnisque urbs electam juventutem armatam misit post eos, et persecuti sunt eos in ore gladii, quousque pervenirent ad extremitatem finium suorum.
7 Reliqui autem qui erant in Bethulia, ingressi sunt castra Assyriorum, et prædam quam fugientes Assyrii reliquerant, abstulerunt, et onustati sunt valde.
8 Hi vero qui victores reversi sunt ad Bethuliam, omnia quæ erant illorum attulerunt secum, ita ut non esset numerus in pecoribus et jumentis et universis mobilibus eorum, ut a minimo usque ad maximum omnes divites fierent de prædationibus eorum.

9 Joacim autem summus pontifex de Jerusalem venit in Bethuliam cum universis presbyteris suis ut videret Judith.
10 Quæ cum exisset ad illum, benedixerunt eam omnes una voce, dicentes: Tu gloria Jerusalem; tu lætitia Israël; tu honorificentia populi nostri:
11 quia fecisti viriliter, et confortatum est cor tuum, eo quod castitatem amaveris, et post virum tuum, alterum nescieris: ideo et manus Domini confortavit te, et ideo eris benedicta in æternum.
12 Et dixit omnis populus: Fiat, fiat.

13 Per dies autem triginta, vix collecta sunt spolia Assyriorum a populo Israël.
14 Porro autem universa quæ Holofernis peculiaria fuisse probata sunt, dederunt Judith in auro, et argento, et vestibus, et gemmis, et omni supellectili: et tradita sunt omnia illi a populo.
15 Et omnes populi gaudebant cum mulieribus, et virginibus, et juvenibus, in organis et citharis.


# Ιουδίθ 15 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ὡς ἤκουσαν οἱ ἐν τοῖς σκηνώμασιν ὄντες ἐξέστησαν ἐπὶ τὸ γεγονός
2 καὶ ἐπέπεσεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς τρόμος καὶ φόβος καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἄνθρωπος μένων κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ πλησίον ἔτι ἀλ{L'} ἐκχυθέντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἔφευγον ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ὁδὸν τοῦ πεδίου καὶ τῆς ὀρεινῆς
3 καὶ οἱ παρεμβεβληκότες ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ κύκλῳ Βαιτυλουα καὶ ἐτράπησαν εἰς φυγήν καὶ τότε οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πᾶς ἀνὴρ πολεμιστὴς ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐξεχύθησαν ἐ{P'} αὐτούς
4 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Οζιας εἰς Βαιτομασθαιμ καὶ Βηβαι καὶ Χωβαι καὶ Κωλα καὶ εἰς πᾶν ὅριον Ισραηλ τοὺς ἀπαγγέλλοντας ὑπὲρ τῶν συντετελεσμένων καὶ ἵνα πάντες ἐπεκχυθῶσιν τοῖς πολεμίοις εἰς τὴν ἀναίρεσιν αὐτῶν
5 ὡς δὲ ἤκουσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ πάντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἐπέπεσον ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς καὶ ἔκοπτον αὐτοὺς ἕως Χωβα ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ οἱ ἐξ Ιερουσαλημ παρεγενήθησαν καὶ ἐκ πάσης τῆς ὀρεινῆς ἀνήγγειλαν γὰρ αὐτοῖς τὰ γεγονότα τῇ παρεμβολῇ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ ἐν Γαλααδ καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ ὑπερεκέρασαν αὐτοὺς πληγῇ μεγάλῃ ἕως οὗ παρῆλθον Δαμασκὸν καὶ τὰ ὅρια αὐτῆς
6 οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Βαιτυλουα ἐπέπεσαν τῇ παρεμβολῇ Ασσουρ καὶ ἐπρονόμευσαν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐπλούτησαν σφόδρα
7 οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ ἀναστρέψαντες ἀπὸ τῆς κοπῆς ἐκυρίευσαν τῶν λοιπῶν καὶ αἱ κῶμαι καὶ ἐπαύλεις ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ καὶ πεδινῇ ἐκράτησαν πολλῶν λαφύρων ἦν γὰρ πλῆθος πολὺ σφόδρα
8 καὶ Ιωακιμ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας καὶ ἡ γερουσία τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ιερουσαλημ ἦλθον τοῦ θεάσασθαι τὰ ἀγαθά ἃ ἐποίησεν κύριος τῷ Ισραηλ καὶ τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὴν Ιουδιθ καὶ λαλῆσαι με{T'} αὐτῆς εἰρήνην

9 ὡς δὲ εἰσῆλθον πρὸς αὐτήν εὐλόγησαν αὐτὴν πάντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτήν σὺ ὕψωμα Ιερουσαλημ σὺ γαυρίαμα μέγα τοῦ Ισραηλ σὺ καύχημα μέγα τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν
10 ἐποίησας ταῦτα πάντα ἐν χειρί σου ἐποίησας τὰ ἀγαθὰ μετὰ Ισραηλ καὶ εὐδόκησεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοῖς ὁ θεός εὐλογημένη γίνου παρὰ τῷ παντοκράτορι κυρίῳ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον καὶ εἶπεν πᾶς ὁ λαός γένοιτο
11 καὶ ἐλαφύρευσεν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὴν παρεμβολὴν ἐ{F'} ἡμέρας τριάκοντα καὶ ἔδωκαν τῇ Ιουδιθ τὴν σκηνὴν Ολοφέρνου καὶ πάντα τὰ ἀργυρώματα καὶ τὰς κλίνας καὶ τὰ ὁλκεῖα καὶ πάντα τὰ κατασκευάσματα αὐτοῦ καὶ λαβοῦσα αὐτὴ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὴν ἡμίονον αὐτῆς καὶ ἔζευξεν τὰς ἁμάξας αὐτῆς καὶ ἐσώρευσεν αὐτὰ ἐ{P'} αὐτῶν
12 καὶ συνέδραμεν πᾶσα γυνὴ Ισραηλ τοῦ ἰδεῖν αὐτὴν καὶ εὐλόγησαν αὐτὴν καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτῇ χορὸν ἐξ αὐτῶν καὶ ἔλαβεν θύρσους ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῆς καὶ ἔδωκεν ταῖς γυναιξὶν ταῖς με{T'} αὐτῆς

13 καὶ ἐστεφανώσαντο τὴν ἐλαίαν αὐτὴ καὶ αἱ με{T'} αὐτῆς καὶ προῆλθεν παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν χορείᾳ ἡγουμένη πασῶν τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ ἠκολούθει πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ ἐνωπλισμένοι μετὰ στεφάνων καὶ ὕμνουν ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν
14 καὶ ἐξῆρχεν Ιουδιθ τὴν ἐξομολόγησιν ταύτην ἐν παντὶ Ισραηλ καὶ ὑπερεφώνει πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὴν αἴνεσιν ταύτην
