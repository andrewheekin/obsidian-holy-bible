# Book of Judith 16 (RSVCE)

### Judith Offers Her Hymn of Praise
1 Then Judith began this thanksgiving before all Israel, and all the people loudly sang this song of praise.
2 And Judith said, Begin a song to my God with tambourines, sing to my Lord with cymbals. Raise to him a new psalm;w exalt him, and call upon his name.
3 For God is the Lord who crushes wars; for he has delivered me out of the hands of my pursuers, and brought me to his camp, in the midst of the people.
4 The Assyrian came down from the mountains of the north; he came with myriads of his warriors; their multitude blocked up the valleys, their cavalry covered the hills.
5 He boasted that he would burn up my territory, and kill my young men with the sword, and dash my infants to the ground and seize my children as prey, and take my virgins as booty.
6 But the Lord Almighty has foiled them by the hand of a woman.
7 For their mighty one did not fall by the hands of the young men, nor did the sons of the Titans smite him, nor did tall giants set upon him; but Judith the daughter of Merarʹi undid him with the beauty of her countenance.
8 For she took off her widow’s mourning to exalt the oppressed in Israel. She anointed her face with ointment and fastened her hair with a tiara and put on a linen gown to deceive him.
9 Her sandal ravished his eyes, her beauty captivated his mind, and the sword severed his neck.
10 The Persians trembled at her boldness, the Medes were daunted at her daring.
11 Then my oppressed people shouted for joy; my weak people shoutedxand the enemyytrembled; they lifted up their voices, and the enemyzwere turned back.
12 The sons of maidservants have pierced them through; they were wounded like the children of fugitives, they perished before the army of my Lord.
13 I will sing to my God a new song: O Lord, thou are great and glorious, wonderful in strength, invincible.
14 Let all thy creatures serve thee, for thou didst speak, and they were made. Thou didst send forth thy Spirit,aand it formed them; there is none that can resist thy voice.
15 For the mountains shall be shaken to their foundations with the waters; at thy presence the rocks shall melt like wax, but to those who fear thee thou wilt continue to show mercy.
16 For every sacrifice as a fragrant offering is a small thing, and all fat for burnt offerings to thee is a very little thing, but he who fears the Lord shall be great for ever.
17 Woe to the nations that rise up against my people! The Lord Almighty will take vengeance on them in the day of judgment; fire and worms he will give to their flesh; they shall weep in pain for ever.
18 When they arrived at Jerusalem they worshiped God. As soon as the people were purified, they offered their burnt offerings, their freewill offerings, and their gifts.
19 Judith also dedicated to God all the vessels of Holoferʹnes, which the people had given her; and the canopy which she took for herself from his bedchamber she gave as a votive offering to the Lord.
20 So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for three months, and Judith remained with them.
### The Renown and Death of Judith
21 After this every one returned home to his own inheritance, and Judith went to Bethuʹlia, and remained on her estate, and was honored in her time throughout the whole country.
22 Many desired to marry her, but she remained a widow all the days of her life after Manasʹseh her husband died and was gathered to his people.
23 She became more and more famous, and grew old in her husband’s house, until she was one hundred and five years old. She set her maid free. She died in Bethuʹlia, and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasʹseh,
24 and the house of Israel mourned for her seven days. Before she died she distributed her property to all those who were next of kin to her husband Manasʹseh, and to her own nearest kindred.
25 And no one ever again spread terror among the people of Israel in the days of Judith, or for a long time after her death.


# Liber Judith 16 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Tunc cantavit canticum hoc Domino Judith, dicens:
2 Incipite Domino in tympanis;cantate Domino in cymbalis;modulamini illi psalmum novum:exaltate, et invocate nomen ejus.
3 Dominus conterens bella,Dominus nomen est illi.
4 Qui posuit castra sua in medio populi sui,ut eriperet nos de manu omnium inimicorum nostrorum.

5 Venit Assur ex montibus ab aquilonein multitudine fortitudinis suæ:cujus multitudo obturavit torrentes,et equi eorum cooperuerunt valles.
6 Dixit se incensurum fines meos,et juvenes meos occisurum gladio;infantes meos dare in prædam,et virgines in captivitatem.
7 Dominus autem omnipotens nocuit eum,et tradidit eum in manus feminæ, et confodit eum.
8 Non enim cecidit potens eorum a juvenibus,nec filii Titan percusserunt eum,nec excelsi gigantes opposuerunt se illi:sed Judith filia Merari in specie faciei suæ dissolvit eum.
9 Exuit enim se vestimento viduitatis,et induit se vestimento lætitiæin exultatione filiorum Israël.
10 Unxit faciem suam unguento,et colligavit cincinnos suos mitra;accepit stolam novem ad decipiendum illum.
11 Sandalia ejus rapuerunt oculos ejus;pulchritudo ejus captivam fecit animam ejus:amputavit pugione cervicem ejus.
12 Horruerunt Persæ constantiam ejus,et Medi audaciam ejus.
13 Tunc ululaverunt castra Assyriorum,quando apparuerunt humiles mei, arescentes in siti.
14 Filii puellarum compunxerunt eos,et sicut pueros fugientes occiderunt eos:perierunt in prælio a facie Domini Dei mei.

15 Hymnum cantemus Domino;hymnum novum cantemus Deo nostro.
16 Adonai Domine, magnus es tu,et præclarus in virtute tua:et quem superare nemo potest.
17 Tibi serviat omnis creatura tua,quia dixisti, et facta sunt;misisti spiritum tuum, et creata sunt:et non est qui resistat voci tuæ.
18 Montes a fundamentis movebuntur cum aquis;petræ, sicut cera, liquescent ante faciem tuam.
19 Qui autem timent te,magni erunt apud te per omnia.
20 Væ genti insurgenti super genus meum:Dominus enim omnipotens vindicabit in eis;in die judicii visitabit illos.
21 Dabit enim ignem et vermes in carnes eorum,ut urantur et sentiant usque in sempiternum.

22 Et factum est post hæc, omnis populus post victoriam venit in Jerusalem adorare Dominum: et mox ut purificati sunt, obtulerunt omnes holocausta, et vota, et repromissiones suas.
23 Porro Judith universa vasa bellica Holofernis, quæ dedit illi populus, et conopeum quod ipsa sustulerat de cubili ipsius, obtulit in anathema oblivionis.
24 Erat autem populus jucundus secundum faciem sanctorum: et per tres menses gaudium hujus victoriæ celebratum est cum Judith.
25 Post dies autem illos, unusquisque rediit in domum suam: et Judith magna facta est in Bethulia, et præclarior erat universæ terræ Israël.
26 Erat enim virtuti castitas adjuncta, ita ut non cognosceret virum omnibus diebus vitæ suæ, ex quo defunctus est Manasses vir ejus.
27 Erat autem, diebus festis, procedens cum magna gloria.
28 Mansit autem in domo viri sui annos centum quinque, et dimisit abram suam liberam: et defuncta est ac sepulta cum viro suo in Bethulia.
29 Luxitque illam omnis populus diebus septem.
30 In omni autem spatio vitæ ejus non fuit qui perturbaret Israël, et post mortem ejus annis multis.
31 Dies autem victoriæ hujus festivitatis ab Hebræis in numero sanctorum dierum accipitur, et colitur a Judæis ex illo tempore usque in præsentem diem.


# Ιουδίθ 16 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδιθ ἐξάρχετε τῷ θεῷ μου ἐν τυμπάνοις ᾄσατε τῷ κυρίῳ ἐν κυμβάλοις ἐναρμόσασθε αὐτῷ ψαλμὸν καὶ αἶνον ὑψοῦτε καὶ ἐπικαλεῖσθε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ
2 ὅτι θεὸς συντρίβων πολέμους κύριος ὅτι εἰς παρεμβολὰς αὐτοῦ ἐν μέσῳ λαοῦ ἐξείλατό με ἐκ χειρὸς καταδιωκόντων με
3 ἦλθεν Ασσουρ ἐξ ὀρέων ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἦλθεν ἐν μυριάσι δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ ὧν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῶν ἐνέφραξεν χειμάρρους καὶ ἡ ἵππος αὐτῶν ἐκάλυψεν βουνούς
4 εἶπεν ἐμπρήσειν τὰ ὅριά μου καὶ τοὺς νεανίσκους μου ἀνελεῖν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ τὰ θηλάζοντά μου θήσειν εἰς ἔδαφος καὶ τὰ νήπιά μου δώσειν εἰς προνομὴν καὶ τὰς παρθένους μου σκυλεῦσαι

5 κύριος παντοκράτωρ ἠθέτησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ θηλείας
6 οὐ γὰρ ὑπέπεσεν ὁ δυνατὸς αὐτῶν ὑπὸ νεανίσκων οὐδὲ υἱοὶ τιτάνων ἐπάταξαν αὐτόν οὐδὲ ὑψηλοὶ γίγαντες ἐπέθεντο αὐτῷ ἀλλὰ Ιουδιθ θυγάτηρ Μεραρι ἐν κάλλει προσώπου αὐτῆς παρέλυσεν αὐτόν
7 ἐξεδύσατο γὰρ στολὴν χηρεύσεως αὐτῆς εἰς ὕψος τῶν πονούντων ἐν Ισραηλ ἠλείψατο τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς ἐν μυρισμῷ
8 καὶ ἐδήσατο τὰς τρίχας αὐτῆς ἐν μίτρᾳ καὶ ἔλαβεν στολὴν λινῆν εἰς ἀπάτην αὐτοῦ
9 τὸ σανδάλιον αὐτῆς ἥρπασεν ὀφθαλμὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ κάλλος αὐτῆς ᾐχμαλώτισεν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ διῆλθεν ὁ ἀκινάκης τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ
10 ἔφριξαν Πέρσαι τὴν τόλμαν αὐτῆς καὶ Μῆδοι τὸ θράσος αὐτῆς ἐταράχθησαν
11 τότε ἠλάλαξαν οἱ ταπεινοί μου καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ ἀσθενοῦντές μου καὶ ἐπτοήθησαν ὕψωσαν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνετράπησαν
12 υἱοὶ κορασίων κατεκέντησαν αὐτοὺς καὶ ὡς παῖδας αὐτομολούντων ἐτίτρωσκον αὐτούς ἀπώλοντο ἐκ παρατάξεως κυρίου μου
13 ὑμνήσω τῷ θεῷ μου ὕμνον καινόν κύριε μέγας εἶ καὶ ἔνδοξος θαυμαστὸς ἐν ἰσχύι ἀνυπέρβλητος
14 σοὶ δουλευσάτω πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις σου ὅτι εἶπας καὶ ἐγενήθησαν ἀπέστειλας τὸ πνεῦμά σου καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἀντιστήσεται τῇ φωνῇ σου

15 ὄρη γὰρ ἐκ θεμελίων σὺν ὕδασιν σαλευθήσεται πέτραι {D'} ἀπὸ προσώπου σου ὡς κηρὸς τακήσονται ἔτι δὲ τοῖς φοβουμένοις σε σὺ εὐιλατεύσεις αὐτοῖς
16 ὅτι μικρὸν πᾶσα θυσία εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας καὶ ἐλάχιστον πᾶν στέαρ εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμά σοι ὁ δὲ φοβούμενος τὸν κύριον μέγας διὰ παντός
17 οὐαὶ ἔθνεσιν ἐπανιστανομένοις τῷ γένει μου κύριος παντοκράτωρ ἐκδικήσει αὐτοὺς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κρίσεως δοῦναι πῦρ καὶ σκώληκας εἰς σάρκας αὐτῶν καὶ κλαύσονται ἐν αἰσθήσει ἕως αἰῶνος
18 ὡς δὲ ἤλθοσαν εἰς Ιερουσαλημ προσεκύνησαν τῷ θεῷ καὶ ἡνίκα ἐκαθαρίσθη ὁ λαός ἀνήνεγκαν τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἑκούσια αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ δόματα
19 καὶ ἀνέθηκεν Ιουδιθ πάντα τὰ σκεύη Ολοφέρνου ὅσα ἔδωκεν ὁ λαὸς αὐτῇ καὶ τὸ κωνώπιον ὃ ἔλαβεν ἑαυτῇ ἐκ τοῦ κοιτῶνος αὐτοῦ εἰς ἀνάθημα τῷ θεῷ ἔδωκεν
20 καὶ ἦν ὁ λαὸς εὐφραινόμενος ἐν Ιερουσαλημ κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἁγίων ἐπὶ μῆνας τρεῖς καὶ Ιουδιθ με{T'} αὐτῶν κατέμεινεν
21 μετὰ δὲ τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας ἀνέζευξεν ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ Ιουδιθ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς Βαιτυλουα καὶ κατέμεινεν ἐπὶ τῆς ὑπάρξεως αὐτῆς καὶ ἐγένετο κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν αὐτῆς ἔνδοξος ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ

22 καὶ πολλοὶ ἐπεθύμησαν αὐτήν καὶ οὐκ ἔγνω ἀνὴρ αὐτὴν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτῆς ἀ{F'} ἧς ἡμέρας ἀπέθανεν Μανασσης ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς καὶ προσετέθη πρὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ
23 καὶ ἦν προβαίνουσα μεγάλη σφόδρα καὶ ἐγήρασεν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς ἔτη ἑκατὸν πέντε καὶ ἀφῆκεν τὴν ἅβραν αὐτῆς ἐλευθέραν καὶ ἀπέθανεν εἰς Βαιτυλουα καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὴν ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς Μανασση
24 καὶ ἐπένθησεν αὐτὴν οἶκος Ισραηλ ἡμέρας ἑπτά καὶ διεῖλεν τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῆς πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτὴν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔγγιστα Μανασση τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ τοῖς ἔγγιστα τοῦ γένους αὐτῆς
25 καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἔτι ὁ ἐκφοβῶν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ισραηλ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ιουδιθ καὶ μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτὴν ἡμέρας πολλάς
