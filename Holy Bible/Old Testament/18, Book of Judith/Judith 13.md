# Book of Judith 13 (RSVCE)

### Judith Beheads Holofernes
1 When evening came, his slaves quickly withdrew, and Bagoʹas closed the tent from outside and shut out the attendants from his master’s presence; and they went to bed, for they all were weary because the banquet had lasted long.
2 So Judith was left alone in the tent, with Holoferʹnes stretched out on his bed, for he was overcome with wine.
3 Now Judith had told her maid to stand outside the bedchamber and to wait for her to come out, as she did every day; for she said she would be going out for her prayers. And she had said the same thing to Bagoʹas.
4 So every one went out, and no one, either small or great, was left in the bedchamber. Then Judith, standing beside his bed, said in her heart, “O Lord God of all might, look in this hour upon the work of my hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem.
5 For now is the time to help thy inheritance, and to carry out my undertaking for the destruction of the enemies who have risen up against us.”
6 She went up to the post at the end of the bed, above Holoferʹnes’ head, and took down his sword that hung there.
7 She came close to his bed and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, “Give me strength this day, O Lord God of Israel!”
8 And she struck his neck twice with all her might, and severed his head from his body.
9 Then she tumbled his body off the bed and pulled down the canopy from the posts; after a moment she went out, and gave Holoferʹnes’ head to her maid,
### Judith Returns to Bethulia
10 who placed it in her food bag. Then the two of them went out together, as they were accustomed to go for prayer; and they passed through the camp and circled around the valley and went up the mountain to Bethuʹlia and came to its gates.
11 Judith called out from afar to the watchmen at the gates, “Open, open the gate! God, our God, is still with us, to show his power in Israel, and his strength against our enemies, even as he has done this day!”
12 When the men of her city heard her voice, they hurried down to the city gate and called together the elders of the city.
13 They all ran together, both small and great, for it was unbelievable that she had returned; they opened the gate and admitted them, and they kindled a fire for light, and gathered around them.
14 Then she said to them with a loud voice, “Praise God, O praise him! Praise God, who has not withdrawn his mercy from the house of Israel, but has destroyed our enemies by my hand this very night!”
15 Then she took the head out of the bag and showed it to them, and said, “See, here is the head of Holoferʹnes, the commander of the Assyrian army, and here is the canopy beneath which he lay in his drunken stupor. The Lord has struck him down by the hand of a woman.
16 As the Lord lives, who has protected me in the way I went, it was my face that tricked him to his destruction, and yet he committed no act of sin with me, to defile and shame me.”
17 All the people were greatly astonished, and bowed down and worshiped God, and said with one accord, “Blessed art thou, our God, who hast brought into contempt this day the enemies of thy people.”
18 And Uzziʹah said to her, “O daughter, you are blessed by the Most High God above all women on earth; and blessed be the Lord God, who created the heavens and the earth, who has guided you to strike the head of the leader of our enemies.
19 Your hope will never depart from the hearts of men, as they remember the power of God.
20 May God grant this to be a perpetual honor to you, and may he visit you with blessings, because you did not spare your own life when our nation was brought low, but have avenged our ruin, walking in the straight path before our God.” And all the people said, “So be it, so be it!”


# Liber Judith 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Ut autem sero factum est, festinaverunt servi illius ad hospitia sua, et conclusit Vagao ostia cubiculi, et abiit.
2 Erant autem omnes fatigati a vino,
3 eratque Judith sola in cubiculo.
4 Porro Holofernes jacebat in lecto, nimia ebrietate sopitus.
5 Dixitque Judith puellæ suæ ut staret foris ante cubiculum, et observaret.
6 Stetitque Judith ante lectum, orans cum lacrimis, et labiorum motu in silentio,
7 dicens: Confirma me, Domine Deus Israël, et respice in hac hora ad opera manuum mearum, ut, sicut promisisti, Jerusalem civitatem tuam erigas: et hoc quod credens per te posse fieri cogitavi, perficiam.
8 Et cum hæc dixisset, accessit ad columnam quæ erat ad caput lectuli ejus, et pugionem ejus, qui in ea ligatus pendebat, exsolvit.
9 Cumque evaginasset illum, apprehendit comam capitis ejus, et ait: Confirma me, Domine Deus, in hac hora.
10 Et percussit bis in cervicem ejus, et abscidit caput ejus, et abstulit conopeum ejus a columnis, et evolvit corpus ejus truncum.
11 Et post pusillum exivit, et tradidit caput Holofernis ancillæ suæ, et jussit ut mitteret illud in peram suam.
12 Et exierunt duæ, secundum consuetudinem suam, quasi ad orationem, et transierunt castra, et gyrantes vallem, venerunt ad portam civitatis.

13 Et dixit Judith a longe custodibus murorum: Aperite portas, quoniam nobiscum est Deus, qui fecit virtutem in Israël.
14 Et factum est cum audissent viri vocem ejus, vocaverunt presbyteros civitatis.
15 Et concurrerunt ad eam omnes, a minimo usque ad maximum: quoniam sperabant eam jam non esse venturam.
16 Et accendentes luminaria, congyraverunt circa eam universi: illa autem ascendens in eminentiorem locum, jussit fieri silentium. Cumque omnes tacuissent,
17 dixit Judith: Laudate Dominum Deum nostrum, qui non deseruit sperantes in se,
18 et in me ancilla sua adimplevit misericordiam suam, quam promisit domui Israël: et interfecit in manu mea hostem populi sui hac nocte.
19 Et proferens de pera caput Holofernis, ostendit illis, dicens: Ecce caput Holofernis principis militiæ Assyriorum, et ecce conopeum illius, in quo recumbebat in ebrietate sua, ubi per manum feminæ percussit illum Dominus Deus noster.
20 Vivit autem ipse Dominus, quoniam custodivit me angelus ejus et hinc euntem, et ibi commorantem, et inde huc revertentem, et non permisit me Dominus ancillam suam coinquinari, sed sine pollutione peccati revocavit me vobis gaudentem in victoria sua, in evasione mea, et in liberatione vestra.
21 Confitemini illi omnes, quoniam bonus, quoniam in sæculum misericordia ejus.

22 Universi autem adorantes Dominum, dixerunt ad eam: Benedixit te Dominus in virtute sua, quia per te ad nihilum redegit inimicos nostros.
23 Porro Ozias princeps populi Israël dixit ad eam: Benedicta es tu, filia, a Domino Deo excelso præ omnibus mulieribus super terram.
24 Benedictus Dominus, qui creavit cælum et terram, qui te direxit in vulnera capitis principis inimicorum nostrorum:
25 quia hodie nomen tuum ita magnificavit, ut non recedat laus tua de ore hominum qui memores fuerint virtutis Domini in æternum, pro quibus non pepercisti animæ tuæ propter angustias et tribulationem generis tui, sed subvenisti ruinæ ante conspectum Dei nostri.
26 Et dixit omnis populus: Fiat, fiat.

27 Porro Achior vocatus venit, et dixit ei Judith: Deus Israël, cui tu testimonium dedisti quod ulciscatur se de inimicis suis, ipse caput omnium incredulorum incidit hac nocte in manu mea.
28 Et ut probes quia ita est, ecce caput Holofernis, qui in contemptu superbiæ suæ Deum Israël contempsit, et tibi interitum minabatur, dicens: Cum captus fuerit populus Israël, gladio perforari præcipiam latera tua.
29 Videns autem Achior caput Holofernis, angustiatus præ pavore cecidit in faciem suam super terram, et æstuavit anima ejus.
30 Postea vero quam resumpto spiritu recreatus est, procidit ad pedes ejus, et adoravit eam, et dixit:
31 Benedicta tu a Deo tuo in omni tabernaculo Jacob, quoniam in omni gente quæ audierit nomen tuum, magnificabitur super te Deus Israël.


# Ιουδίθ 13 (Septuagint)

1 ὡς δὲ ὀψία ἐγένετο ἐσπούδασαν οἱ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ ἀναλύειν καὶ Βαγώας συνέκλεισεν τὴν σκηνὴν ἔξωθεν καὶ ἀπέκλεισεν τοὺς παρεστῶτας ἐκ προσώπου τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπῴχοντο εἰς τὰς κοίτας αὐτῶν ἦσαν γὰρ πάντες κεκοπωμένοι διὰ τὸ ἐπὶ πλεῖον γεγονέναι τὸν πότον
2 ὑπελείφθη δὲ Ιουδιθ μόνη ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ καὶ Ολοφέρνης προπεπτωκὼς ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην αὐτοῦ ἦν γὰρ περικεχυμένος αὐτῷ ὁ οἶνος
3 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδιθ τῇ δούλῃ αὐτῆς στῆναι ἔξω τοῦ κοιτῶνος αὐτῆς καὶ ἐπιτηρεῖν τὴν ἔξοδον αὐτῆς καθάπερ κα{Q'} ἡμέραν ἐξελεύσεσθαι γὰρ ἔφη ἐπὶ τὴν προσευχὴν αὐτῆς καὶ τῷ Βαγώᾳ ἐλάλησεν κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα
4 καὶ ἀπήλθοσαν πάντες ἐκ προσώπου καὶ οὐδεὶς κατελείφθη ἐν τῷ κοιτῶνι ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου καὶ στᾶσα Ιουδιθ παρὰ τὴν κλίνην αὐτοῦ εἶπεν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς κύριε ὁ θεὸς πάσης δυνάμεως ἐπίβλεψον ἐν τῇ ὥρᾳ ταύτῃ ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν μου εἰς ὕψωμα Ιερουσαλημ
5 ὅτι νῦν καιρὸς ἀντιλαβέσθαι τῆς κληρονομίας σου καὶ ποιῆσαι τὸ ἐπιτήδευμά μου εἰς θραῦσμα ἐχθρῶν οἳ ἐπανέστησαν ἡμῖν
6 καὶ προσελθοῦσα τῷ κανόνι τῆς κλίνης ὃς ἦν πρὸς κεφαλῆς Ολοφέρνου καθεῖλεν τὸν ἀκινάκην αὐτοῦ ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
7 καὶ ἐγγίσασα τῆς κλίνης ἐδράξατο τῆς κόμης τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν κραταίωσόν με κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ
8 καὶ ἐπάταξεν εἰς τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ δὶς ἐν τῇ ἰσχύι αὐτῆς καὶ ἀφεῖλεν τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
9 καὶ ἀπεκύλισε τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς στρωμνῆς καὶ ἀφεῖλε τὸ κωνώπιον ἀπὸ τῶν στύλων καὶ με{T'} ὀλίγον ἐξῆλθεν καὶ παρέδωκεν τῇ ἅβρᾳ αὐτῆς τὴν κεφαλὴν Ολοφέρνου
10 καὶ ἐνέβαλεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν πήραν τῶν βρωμάτων αὐτῆς καὶ ἐξῆλθον αἱ δύο ἅμα κατὰ τὸν ἐθισμὸν αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν προσευχήν καὶ διελθοῦσαι τὴν παρεμβολὴν ἐκύκλωσαν τὴν φάραγγα ἐκείνην καὶ προσανέβησαν τὸ ὄρος Βαιτυλουα καὶ ἤλθοσαν πρὸς τὰς πύλας αὐτῆς
11 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδιθ μακρόθεν τοῖς φυλάσσουσιν ἐπὶ τῶν πυλῶν ἀνοίξατε ἀνοίξατε δὴ τὴν πύλην με{Q'} ἡμῶν ὁ θεὸς ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν ποιῆσαι ἔτι ἰσχὺν ἐν Ισραηλ καὶ κράτος κατὰ τῶν ἐχθρῶν καθὰ καὶ σήμερον ἐποίησεν
12 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσαν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως αὐτῆς τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῆς ἐσπούδασαν τοῦ καταβῆναι ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν καὶ συνεκάλεσαν τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς πόλεως

13 καὶ συνέδραμον πάντες ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου αὐτῶν ὅτι παράδοξον ἦν αὐτοῖς τὸ ἐλθεῖν αὐτήν καὶ ἤνοιξαν τὴν πύλην καὶ ὑπεδέξαντο αὐτὰς καὶ ἅψαντες πῦρ εἰς φαῦσιν περιεκύκλωσαν αὐτάς
14 ἡ δὲ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς φωνῇ μεγάλῃ αἰνεῖτε τὸν θεόν αἰνεῖτε αἰνεῖτε τὸν θεόν ὃς οὐκ ἀπέστησεν τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Ισραηλ ἀλ{L'} ἔθραυσε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἡμῶν διὰ χειρός μου ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ
15 καὶ προελοῦσα τὴν κεφαλὴν ἐκ τῆς πήρας ἔδειξεν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἰδοὺ ἡ κεφαλὴ Ολοφέρνου ἀρχιστρατήγου δυνάμεως Ασσουρ καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ κωνώπιον ἐν ᾧ κατέκειτο ἐν ταῖς μέθαις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος ἐν χειρὶ θηλείας
16 καὶ ζῇ κύριος ὃς διεφύλαξέν με ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ μου ᾗ ἐπορεύθην ὅτι ἠπάτησεν αὐτὸν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου εἰς ἀπώλειαν αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησεν ἁμάρτημα με{T'} ἐμοῦ εἰς μίασμα καὶ αἰσχύνην
17 καὶ ἐξέστη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα καὶ κύψαντες προσεκύνησαν τῷ θεῷ καὶ εἶπαν ὁμοθυμαδόν εὐλογητὸς εἶ ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν ὁ ἐξουδενώσας ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ σήμερον τοὺς ἐχθροὺς τοῦ λαοῦ σου
18 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Οζιας εὐλογητὴ σύ θύγατερ τῷ θεῷ τῷ ὑψίστῳ παρὰ πάσας τὰς γυναῖκας τὰς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ εὐλογημένος κύριος ὁ θεός ὃς ἔκτισεν τοὺς οὐρανοὺς καὶ τὴν γῆν ὃς κατεύθυνέν σε εἰς τραῦμα κεφαλῆς ἄρχοντος ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν
19 ὅτι οὐκ ἀποστήσεται ἡ ἐλπίς σου ἀπὸ καρδίας ἀνθρώπων μνημονευόντων ἰσχὺν θεοῦ ἕως αἰῶνος
20 καὶ ποιήσαι σοι αὐτὰ ὁ θεὸς εἰς ὕψος αἰώνιον τοῦ ἐπισκέψασθαί σε ἐν ἀγαθοῖς ἀν{Q'} ὧν οὐκ ἐφείσω τῆς ψυχῆς σου διὰ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν ἀλ{L'} ἐπεξῆλθες τῷ πτώματι ἡμῶν ἐ{P'} εὐθεῖαν πορευθεῖσα ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ εἶπαν πᾶς ὁ λαός γένοιτο γένοιτο
