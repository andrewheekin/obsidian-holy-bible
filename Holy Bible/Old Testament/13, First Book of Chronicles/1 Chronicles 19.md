# First Book of Chronicles 19 (RSVCE)

### Defeat of the Ammonites and Arameʹans
1 Now after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his stead.
2 And David said, “I will deal loyally with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David’s servants came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites, to console him.
3 But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?”
4 So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away;
5 and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”
6 When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotaʹmia, from Aram-maʹacah, and from Zobah.
7 They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maʹacah with his army, who came and encamped before Medʹeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle.
8 When David heard of it, he sent Joʹab and all the army of the mighty men.
9 And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
10 When Joʹab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the picked men of Israel, and arrayed them against the Syrians;
11 the rest of his men he put in the charge of Abiʹshai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites.
12 And he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you.
13 Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God; and may theLorddo what seems good to him.”
14 So Joʹab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle; and they fled before him.
15 And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abiʹshai, Joʹab’s brother, and entered the city. Then Joʹab came to Jerusalem.
16 But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphraʹtes, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadeʹzer at their head.
17 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and crossed the Jordan, and came to them, and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
18 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand foot soldiers, and killed also Shophach the commander of their army.
19 And when the servants of Hadadeʹzer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and became subject to him. So the Syrians were not willing to help the Ammonites any more.


# Liber Primus Paralipomenon 19 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Accidit autem ut moreretur Naas rex filiorum Ammon, et regnaret filius ejus pro eo.
2 Dixitque David: Faciam misericordiam cum Hanon filio Naas: præstitit enim mihi pater ejus gratiam. Misitque David nuntios ad consolandum eum super morte patris sui. Qui cum pervenissent in terram filiorum Ammon ut consolarentur Hanon,
3 dixerunt principes filiorum Ammon ad Hanon: Tu forsitan putas, quod David honoris causa in patrem tuum miserit qui consolentur te: nec animadvertis quod ut explorent, et investigent, et scrutentur terram tuam, venerint ad te servi ejus.
4 Igitur Hanon pueros David decalvavit, et rasit, et præcidit tunicas eorum a natibus usque ad pedes, et dimisit eos.
5 Qui cum abiissent, et hoc mandassent David, misit in occursum eorum (grandem enim contumeliam sustinuerant) et præcepit ut manerent in Jericho, donec cresceret barba eorum, et tunc reverterentur.
6 Videntes autem filii Ammon quod injuriam fecissent David, tam Hanon quam reliquus populus, miserunt mille talenta argenti, ut conducerent sibi de Mesopotamia, et de Syria Maacha, et de Soba currus et equites.
7 Conduxeruntque triginta duo millia curruum, et regem Maacha cum populo ejus. Qui cum venissent, castrametati sunt e regione Medaba. Filii quoque Ammon congregati de urbibus suis venerunt ad bellum.
8 Quod cum audisset David, misit Joab, et omnem exercitum virorum fortium:
9 egressique filii Ammon, direxerunt aciem juxta portam civitatis; reges autem, qui ad auxilium ejus venerant, separatim in agro steterunt.
10 Igitur Joab, intelligens bellum ex adverso et post tergum contra se fieri, elegit viros fortissimos de universo Israël, et perrexit contra Syrum.
11 Reliquam autem partem populi dedit sub manu Abisai fratris sui: et perrexerunt contra filios Ammon.
12 Dixitque: Si vicerit me Syrus, auxilio eris mihi: si autem superaverint te filii Ammon, ero tibi in præsidium.
13 Confortare, et agamus viriliter pro populo nostro, et pro urbibus Dei nostri: Dominus autem, quod in conspectu suo bonum est, faciet.
14 Perrexit ergo Joab et populus qui cum eo erat, contra Syrum ad prælium: et fugavit eos.
15 Porro filii Ammon videntes quod fugisset Syrus, ipsi quoque fugerunt Abisai fratrem ejus, et ingressi sunt civitatem: reversusque est etiam Joab in Jerusalem.

16 Videns autem Syrus quod cecidisset coram Israël, misit nuntios, et adduxit Syrum, qui erat trans fluvium: Sophach autem princeps militiæ Adarezer erat dux eorum.
17 Quod cum nuntiatum esset David, congregavit universum Israël, et transivit Jordanem, irruitque in eos et direxit ex adverso aciem, illis contra pugnantibus.
18 Fugit autem Syrus Israël, et interfecit David de Syris septem millia curruum, et quadraginta millia peditum, et Sophach exercitus principem.
19 Videntes autem servi Adarezer se ab Israël esse superatos, transfugerunt ad David, et servierunt ei: noluitque ultra Syria auxilium præbere filiis Ammon.

1 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπέθανεν Ναας βασιλεὺς υἱῶν Αμμων καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Αναν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν{T'} αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ εἶπεν Δαυιδ ποιήσω ἔλεος μετὰ Αναν υἱοῦ Ναας ὡς ἐποίησεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ με{T'} ἐμοῦ ἔλεος καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους Δαυιδ τοῦ παρακαλέσαι αὐτὸν περὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἦλθον παῖδες Δαυιδ εἰς γῆν υἱῶν Αμμων τοῦ παρακαλέσαι αὐτόν
3 καὶ εἶπον ἄρχοντες Αμμων πρὸς Αναν μὴ δοξάζων Δαυιδ τὸν πατέρα σου ἐναντίον σου ἀπέστειλέν σοι παρακαλοῦντας οὐχ ὅπως ἐξερευνήσωσιν τὴν πόλιν τοῦ κατασκοπῆσαι τὴν γῆν ἦλθον παῖδες αὐτοῦ πρὸς σέ
4 καὶ ἔλαβεν Αναν τοὺς παῖδας Δαυιδ καὶ ἐξύρησεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀφεῖλεν τῶν μανδυῶν αὐτῶν τὸ ἥμισυ ἕως τῆς ἀναβολῆς καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτούς
5 καὶ ἦλθον ἀπαγγεῖλαι τῷ Δαυιδ περὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῖς ὅτι ἦσαν ἠτιμωμένοι σφόδρα καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς καθίσατε ἐν Ιεριχω ἕως τοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι τοὺς πώγωνας ὑμῶν καὶ ἀνακάμψατε
6 καὶ εἶδον οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων ὅτι ᾐσχύνθη λαὸς Δαυιδ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Αναν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων χίλια τάλαντα ἀργυρίου τοῦ μισθώσασθαι ἑαυτοῖς ἐκ Συρίας Μεσοποταμίας καὶ ἐκ Συρίας Μοοχα καὶ ἐκ Σωβα ἅρματα καὶ ἱππεῖς
7 καὶ ἐμισθώσαντο ἑαυτοῖς δύο καὶ τριάκοντα χιλιάδας ἁρμάτων καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Μωχα καὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἦλθον καὶ παρενέβαλον κατέναντι Μαιδαβα καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων συνήχθησαν ἐκ τῶν πόλεων αὐτῶν καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὸ πολεμῆσαι
8 καὶ ἤκουσεν Δαυιδ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τὸν Ιωαβ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν στρατιὰν τῶν δυνατῶν
9 καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων καὶ παρατάσσονται εἰς πόλεμον παρὰ τὸν πυλῶνα τῆς πόλεως καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς οἱ ἐλθόντες παρενέβαλον κα{Q'} ἑαυτοὺς ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ
10 καὶ εἶδεν Ιωαβ ὅτι γεγόνασιν ἀντιπρόσωποι τοῦ πολεμεῖν πρὸς αὐτὸν κατὰ πρόσωπον καὶ ἐξόπισθεν καὶ ἐξελέξατο ἐκ παντὸς νεανίου ἐξ Ισραηλ καὶ παρετάξαντο ἐναντίον τοῦ Σύρου
11 καὶ τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ λαοῦ ἔδωκεν ἐν χειρὶ Αβεσσα ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ παρετάξαντο ἐξ ἐναντίας υἱῶν Αμμων
12 καὶ εἶπεν ἐὰν κρατήσῃ ὑπὲρ ἐμὲ Σύρος καὶ ἔσῃ μοι εἰς σωτηρίαν καὶ ἐὰν υἱοὶ Αμμων κρατήσωσιν ὑπὲρ σέ καὶ σώσω σε
13 ἀνδρίζου καὶ ἐνισχύσωμεν περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ περὶ τῶν πόλεων τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ κύριος τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ ποιήσει
14 καὶ παρετάξατο Ιωαβ καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ με{T'} αὐτοῦ κατέναντι Σύρων εἰς πόλεμον καὶ ἔφυγον ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ
15 καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Αμμων εἶδον ὅτι ἔφυγον Σύροι καὶ ἔφυγον καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου Ιωαβ καὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου Αβεσσα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἦλθεν Ιωαβ εἰς Ιερουσαλημ

16 καὶ εἶδεν Σύρος ὅτι ἐτροπώσατο αὐτὸν Ισραηλ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους καὶ ἐξήγαγον τὸν Σύρον ἐκ τοῦ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ Σωφαχ ἀρχιστράτηγος δυνάμεως Αδρααζαρ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν
17 καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Δαυιδ καὶ συνήγαγεν τὸν πάντα Ισραηλ καὶ διέβη τὸν Ιορδάνην καὶ ἦλθεν ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς καὶ παρετάξατο ἐ{P'} αὐτούς καὶ παρατάσσεται Σύρος ἐξ ἐναντίας Δαυιδ καὶ ἐπολέμησαν αὐτόν
18 καὶ ἔφυγεν Σύρος ἀπὸ προσώπου Δαυιδ καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν Δαυιδ ἀπὸ τοῦ Σύρου ἑπτὰ χιλιάδας ἁρμάτων καὶ τεσσαράκοντα χιλιάδας πεζῶν καὶ τὸν Σωφαχ ἀρχιστράτηγον δυνάμεως ἀπέκτεινεν
19 καὶ εἶδον παῖδες Αδρααζαρ ὅτι ἐπταίκασιν ἀπὸ προσώπου Ισραηλ καὶ διέθεντο μετὰ Δαυιδ καὶ ἐδούλευσαν αὐτῷ καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν Σύρος τοῦ βοηθῆσαι τοῖς υἱοῖς Αμμων ἔτι
