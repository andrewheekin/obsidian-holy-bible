# First Book of Chronicles 20 (RSVCE)

### Siege and Capture of Rabbah
1 In the spring of the year, the time when kings go forth to battle, Joʹab led out the army, and ravaged the country of the Ammonites, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. And Joʹab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.
2 And David took the crown of their king from his head; he found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
3 And he brought forth the people who were in it, and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and axes; and thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
### Exploits against the Philistines
4 And after this there arose war with the Philistines at Gezer; then Sibʹbecai the Huʹshathite slew Sipʹpai, who was one of the descendants of the giants; and the Philistines were subdued.
5 And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhaʹnan the son of Jaʹir slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
6 And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was descended from the giants.
7 And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimʹe-a, David’s brother, slew him.
8 These were descended from the giants in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.


# Liber Primus Paralipomenon 20 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem post anni circulum, eo tempore quo solent reges ad bella procedere, congregavit Joab exercitum, et robur militiæ, et vastavit terram filiorum Ammon: perrexitque et obsedit Rabba. Porro David manebat in Jerusalem, quando Joab percussit Rabba et destruxit eam.
2 Tulit autem David coronam Melchom de capite ejus, et invenit in ea auri pondo talentum, et pretiosissimas gemmas, fecitque sibi inde diadema: manubias quoque urbis plurimas tulit;
3 populum autem, qui erat in ea, eduxit, et fecit super eos tribulas, et trahas, et ferrata carpenta transire, ita ut dissecarentur et contererentur. Sic fecit David cunctis urbibus filiorum Ammon: et reversus est cum omni populo suo in Jerusalem.

4 Post hæc initum est bellum in Gazer adversum Philisthæos, in quo percussit Sobochai Husathites, Saphai de genere Raphaim, et humiliavit eos.
5 Aliud quoque bellum gestum est adversus Philisthæos, in quo percussit Adeodatus filius Saltus Bethlehemites fratrem Goliath Gethæi, cujus hastæ lignum erat quasi liciatorium texentium.
6 Sed et aliud bellum accidit in Geth, in quo fuit homo longissimus, senos habens digitos, id est, simul viginti quatuor: qui et ipse de Rapha fuerat stirpe generatus.
7 Hic blasphemavit Israël: et percussit eum Jonathan filius Samaa fratris David.

1 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐπιόντι ἔτει ἐν τῇ ἐξόδῳ τῶν βασιλέων καὶ ἤγαγεν Ιωαβ πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν τῆς στρατιᾶς καὶ ἔφθειραν τὴν χώραν υἱῶν Αμμων καὶ ἦλθεν καὶ περιεκάθισεν τὴν Ραββα καὶ Δαυιδ ἐκάθητο ἐν Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ιωαβ τὴν Ραββα καὶ κατέσκαψεν αὐτήν
2 καὶ ἔλαβεν Δαυιδ τὸν στέφανον Μολχολ βασιλέως αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ εὑρέθη ὁ σταθμὸς αὐτοῦ τάλαντον χρυσίου καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ λίθος τίμιος καὶ ἦν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Δαυιδ καὶ σκῦλα τῆς πόλεως ἐξήνεγκεν πολλὰ σφόδρα
3 καὶ τὸν λαὸν τὸν ἐν αὐτῇ ἐξήγαγεν καὶ διέπρισεν πρίοσιν καὶ ἐν σκεπάρνοις σιδηροῖς καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησεν Δαυιδ τοῖς πᾶσιν υἱοῖς Αμμων καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν Δαυιδ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ εἰς Ιερουσαλημ

4 καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἐγένετο ἔτι πόλεμος ἐν Γαζερ μετὰ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τότε ἐπάταξεν Σοβοχαι ὁ Ουσαθι τὸν Σαφου ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῶν γιγάντων καὶ ἐταπείνωσεν αὐτόν
5 καὶ ἐγένετο ἔτι πόλεμος μετὰ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ελλαναν υἱὸς Ιαϊρ τὸν Λεεμι ἀδελφὸν Γολιαθ τοῦ Γεθθαίου καὶ ξύλον δόρατος αὐτοῦ ὡς ἀντίον ὑφαινόντων
6 καὶ ἐγένετο ἔτι πόλεμος ἐν Γεθ καὶ ἦν ἀνὴρ ὑπερμεγέθης καὶ δάκτυλοι αὐτοῦ ἓξ καὶ ἕξ εἴκοσι τέσσαρες καὶ οὗτος ἦν ἀπόγονος γιγάντων
7 καὶ ὠνείδισεν τὸν Ισραηλ καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν Ιωναθαν υἱὸς Σαμαα ἀδελφοῦ Δαυιδ
