# First Book of Chronicles 10 (RSVCE)

### Death of Saul and His Sons
1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboʹa.
2 And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinʹadab and Malʹchishuʹa, the sons of Saul.
3 The battle pressed hard upon Saul, and the archers found him; and he was wounded by the archers.
4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and make sport of me.” But his armor-bearer would not; for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword, and fell upon it.
5 And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword, and died.
6 Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.
7 And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
8 On the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboʹa.
9 And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.
10 And they put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
11 But when all Jaʹbesh-gilʹead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
12 all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
13 So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to theLordin that he did not keep the command of theLord, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance,
14 and did not seek guidance from theLord. Therefore theLordslew him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.


# Liber Primus Paralipomenon 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Philisthiim autem pugnabant contra Israël, fugeruntque viri Israël Palæsthinos, et ceciderunt vulnerati in monte Gelboë.
2 Cumque appropinquassent Philisthæi, persequentes Saul et filios ejus, percusserunt Jonathan, et Abinadab, et Melchisua filios Saul.
3 Et aggravatum est prælium contra Saul, inveneruntque eum sagittarii, et vulneraverunt jaculis.
4 Et dixit Saul ad armigerum suum: Evagina gladium tuum, et interfice me, ne forte veniant incircumcisi isti, et illudant mihi. Noluit autem armiger ejus hoc facere, timore perterritus: arripuit ergo Saul ensem, et irruit in eum.
5 Quod cum vidisset armiger ejus, videlicet mortuum esse Saul, irruit etiam ipse in gladium suum, et mortuus est.
6 Interiit ergo Saul: et tres filii ejus, et omnis domus illius pariter concidit.

7 Quod cum vidissent viri Israël qui habitabant in campestribus, fugerunt: et Saul ac filiis ejus mortuis, dereliquerunt urbes suas, et huc illucque dispersi sunt: veneruntque Philisthiim, et habitaverunt in eis.
8 Die igitur altero detrahentes Philisthiim spolia cæsorum, invenerunt Saul et filios ejus jacentes in monte Gelboë.
9 Cumque spoliassent eum, et amputassent caput, armisque nudassent, miserunt in terram suam, ut circumferretur, et ostenderetur idolorum templis, et populis:
10 arma autem ejus consecraverunt in fano dei sui, et caput affixerunt in templo Dagon.
11 Hoc cum audissent viri Jabes Galaad, omnia scilicet quæ Philisthiim fecerant super Saul,
12 consurrexerunt singuli virorum fortium, et tulerunt cadavera Saul et filiorum ejus: attuleruntque ea in Jabes, et sepelierunt ossa eorum subter quercum, quæ erat in Jabes, et jejunaverunt septem diebus.
13 Mortuus est ergo Saul propter iniquitates suas, eo quod prævaricatus sit mandatum Domini quod præceperat, et non custodierit illud: sed insuper etiam pythonissam consuluerit,
14 nec speraverit in Domino: propter quod interfecit eum, et transtulit regnum ejus ad David filium Isai.

1 καὶ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπολέμησαν πρὸς Ισραηλ καὶ ἔφυγον ἀπὸ προσώπου ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἔπεσον τραυματίαι ἐν ὄρει Γελβουε
2 καὶ κατεδίωξαν ἀλλόφυλοι ὀπίσω Σαουλ καὶ ὀπίσω υἱῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἀλλόφυλοι τὸν Ιωναθαν καὶ τὸν Αμιναδαβ καὶ τὸν Μελχισουε υἱοὺς Σαουλ
3 καὶ ἐβαρύνθη ὁ πόλεμος ἐπὶ Σαουλ καὶ εὗρον αὐτὸν οἱ τοξόται ἐν τοῖς τόξοις καὶ πόνοις καὶ ἐπόνεσεν ἀπὸ τῶν τόξων
4 καὶ εἶπεν Σαουλ τῷ αἴροντι τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ σπάσαι τὴν ῥομφαίαν σου καὶ ἐκκέντησόν με ἐν αὐτῇ μὴ ἔλθωσιν οἱ ἀπερίτμητοι οὗτοι καὶ ἐμπαίξωσίν μοι καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλετο ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐφοβεῖτο σφόδρα καὶ ἔλαβεν Σαουλ τὴν ῥομφαίαν καὶ ἐπέπεσεν ἐ{P'} αὐτήν
5 καὶ εἶδεν ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἀπέθανεν Σαουλ καὶ ἔπεσεν καί γε αὐτὸς ἐπὶ τὴν ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέθανεν
6 καὶ ἀπέθανεν Σαουλ καὶ τρεῖς υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἀπέθανεν

7 καὶ εἶδεν πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ισραηλ ὁ ἐν τῷ αὐλῶνι ὅτι ἔφυγεν Ισραηλ καὶ ὅτι ἀπέθανεν Σαουλ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ κατέλιπον τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν καὶ ἔφυγον καὶ ἦλθον ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐν αὐταῖς
8 καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ ἐχομένῃ καὶ ἦλθον ἀλλόφυλοι τοῦ σκυλεύειν τοὺς τραυματίας καὶ εὗρον τὸν Σαουλ καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ πεπτωκότας ἐν τῷ ὄρει Γελβουε
9 καὶ ἐξέδυσαν αὐτὸν καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέστειλαν εἰς γῆν ἀλλοφύλων κύκλῳ τοῦ εὐαγγελίσασθαι τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν καὶ τῷ λαῷ
10 καὶ ἔθηκαν τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἐν οἴκῳ θεοῦ αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ἔθηκαν ἐν οἴκῳ Δαγων
11 καὶ ἤκουσαν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαλααδ ἅπαντα ἃ ἐποίησαν ἀλλόφυλοι τῷ Σαουλ καὶ τῷ Ισραηλ
12 καὶ ἠγέρθησαν ἐκ Γαλααδ πᾶς ἀνὴρ δυνατὸς καὶ ἔλαβον τὸ σῶμα Σαουλ καὶ τὸ σῶμα τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἤνεγκαν αὐτὰ εἰς Ιαβις καὶ ἔθαψαν τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν ὑπὸ τὴν δρῦν ἐν Ιαβις καὶ ἐνήστευσαν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας
13 καὶ ἀπέθανεν Σαουλ ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις αὐτοῦ αἷς ἠνόμησεν τῷ κυρίῳ κατὰ τὸν λόγον κυρίου διότι οὐκ ἐφύλαξεν ὅτι ἐπηρώτησεν Σαουλ ἐν τῷ ἐγγαστριμύθῳ τοῦ ζητῆσαι καὶ ἀπεκρίνατο αὐτῷ Σαμουηλ ὁ προφήτης
14 καὶ οὐκ ἐζήτησεν κύριον καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ Δαυιδ υἱῷ Ιεσσαι
