# First Book of Chronicles 26 (RSVCE)

### The Gatekeepers
1 As for the divisons of the gatekeepers: of the Korʹahites, Meshelemiʹah the son of Korʹe, of the sons of Asaph.
2 And Meshelemiʹah had sons: Zechariʹah the first-born, Jediʹa-el the second, Zebadiʹah the third, Jathʹni-el the fourth,
3 Elam the fifth, Jeho-haʹnan the sixth, Eli-e-ho-eʹnai the seventh.
4 And Oʹbed-eʹdom had sons: Shemaiʹah the first-born, Jehoʹzabad the second, Joʹah the third, Sachar the fourth, Nethanʹel the fifth,
5 Amʹmi-el the sixth, Isʹsachar the seventh, Pe-ulʹlethai the eighth; for God blessed him.
6 Also to his son Shemaiʹah were sons born who were rulers in their fathers’ houses, for they were men of great ability.
7 The sons of Shemaiʹah: Othni, Rephʹa-el, Obed, and Elzaʹbad, whose brethren were able men, Eliʹhu and Semachiʹah.
8 All these were of the sons of Oʹbed-eʹdom with their sons and brethren, able men qualified for the service; sixty-two of Oʹbed-eʹdom.
9 And Meshelemiʹah had sons and brethren, able men, eighteen.
10 And Hosah, of the sons of Merarʹi, had sons: Shimri the chief (for though he was not the first-born, his father made him chief),
11 Hilkiʹah the second, Tebaliʹah the third, Zechariʹah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.
12 These divisions of the gatekeepers, corresponding to their chief men, had duties, just as their brethren did, ministering in the house of theLord;
13 and they cast lots by fathers’ houses, small and great alike, for their gates.
14 The lot for the east fell to Shelemiʹah. They cast lots also for his son Zechariʹah, a shrewd counselor, and his lot came out for the north.
15 Oʹbed-eʹdom’s came out for the south, and to his sons was allotted the storehouse.
16 For Shuppim and Hosah it came out for the west, at the gate of Shalʹlecheth on the road that goes up. Watch corresponded to watch.
17 On the east there were six each day, on the north four each day, on the south four each day, as well as two and two at the storehouse;
18 and for the parbar on the west there were four at the road and two at the parbar.
19 These were the divisions of the gatekeepers among the Korʹahites and the sons of Merarʹi.
### The Treasurers, Officers, and Judges
20 And of the Levites, Ahiʹjah had charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries of the dedicated gifts.
21 The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers’ houses belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehiʹeli.
22 The sons of Jehiʹeli, Zetham and Joʹel his brother, were in charge of the treasuries of the house of theLord.
23 Of the Amʹramites, the Izʹharites, the Heʹbronites, and the Uzʹzielites—
24 and Shebʹuel the son of Gershom, son of Moses, was chief officer in charge of the treasuries.
25 His brethren: from Elieʹzer were his son Rehabiʹah, and his son Jeshaʹiah, and his son Joram, and his son Zichri, and his son Sheloʹmoth.
26 This Sheloʹmoth and his brethren were in charge of all the treasuries of the dedicated gifts which David the king, and the heads of the fathers’ houses, and the officers of the thousands and the hundreds, and the commanders of the army, had dedicated.
27 From spoil won in battles they dedicated gifts for the maintenance of the house of theLord.
28 Also all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joʹab the son of Zeruʹiah had dedicated—all dedicated gifts were in the care of Sheloʹmoth and his brethren.
29 Of the Izʹharites, Chenaniʹah and his sons were appointed to outside duties for Israel, as officers and judges.
30 Of the Heʹbronites, Hashabiʹah and his brethren, one thousand seven hundred men of ability, had the oversight of Israel westward of the Jordan for all the work of theLordand for the service of the king.
31 Of the Heʹbronites, Jeriʹjah was chief of the Heʹbronites of whatever genealogy or fathers’ houses. (In the fortieth year of David’s reign search was made and men of great ability among them were found at Jazer in Gilead.)
32 King David appointed him and his brethren, two thousand seven hundred men of ability, heads of fathers’ houses, to have the oversight of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manasʹsites for everything pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king.

5 Ammiel sextus, Issachar septimus, Phollathi octavus: quia benedixit illi Dominus.
6 Semei autem filio ejus nati sunt filii, præfecti familiarum suarum: erant enim viri fortissimi.
7 Filii ergo Semeiæ: Othni, et Raphaël, et Obed, Elzabad, fratres ejus viri fortissimi: Eliu quoque et Samachias.
8 Omnes hi, de filiis Obededom: ipsi, et filii et fratres eorum, fortissimi ad ministrandum, sexaginta duo de Obededom.
9 Porro Meselemiæ filii, et fratres eorum robustissimi, decem et octo.
10 De Hosa autem, id est, de filiis Merari: Semri princeps (non enim habuerat primogenitum, et idcirco posuerat eum pater ejus in principem),
11 Helcias secundus, Tabelias tertius, Zacharias quartus: omnes hi filii et fratres Hosa, tredecim.

12 Hi divisi sunt in janitores, ut semper principes custodiarum, sicut et fratres eorum ministrarent in domo Domini.
13 Missæ sunt ergo sortes ex æquo, et parvis et magnis, per familias suas in unamquamque portarum.
14 Cecidit ergo sors orientalis, Selemiæ. Porro Zachariæ filio ejus, viro prudentissimo et erudito, sortito obtigit plaga septentrionalis.
15 Obededom vero et filiis ejus ad austrum: in qua parte domus erat seniorum concilium.
16 Sephim et Hosa ad occidentem, juxta portam, quæ ducit ad viam ascensionis: custodia contra custodiam.
17 Ad orientem vero Levitæ sex: et ad aquilonem, quatuor per diem: atque ad meridiem similiter in die quatuor: et ubi erat concilium bini et bini.
18 In cellulis quoque janitorum ad occidentem quatuor in via, binique per cellulas.
19 Hæ sunt divisiones janitorum filiorum Core et Merari.

20 Porro Achias erat super thesauros domus Dei, et vasa sanctorum.
21 Filii Ledan, filii Gersonni: de Ledan principes familiarum Ledan, et Gersonni, Jehieli.

23 Amramitis, et Isaaritis, et Hebronitis, et Ozihelitis.
24 Subaël autem filius Gersom filii Moysi, præpositus thesauris.
25 Fratres quoque ejus Eliezer, cujus filius Rahabia, et hujus filius Isaias, et hujus filius Joram, hujus quoque filius Zechri, et hujus filius Selemith.
26 Ipse Selemith, et fratres ejus, super thesauros sanctorum quæ sanctificavit David rex, et principes familiarum, et tribuni, et centuriones, et duces exercitus,
27 de bellis et manubiis præliorum, quæ consecraverant ad instaurationem et supellectilem templi Domini.
28 Hæc autem universa sanctificavit Samuel videns, et Saul filius Cis, et Abner filius Ner, et Joab filius Sarviæ: omnes qui sanctificaverant ea per manum Selemith et fratrum ejus.

29 Isaaritis vero præerat Chonenias, et filii ejus ad opera forinsecus super Israël ad docendum et judicandum eos.
30 Porro de Hebronitis Hasabias, et fratres ejus viri fortissimi, mille septingenti præerant Israëli trans Jordanem contra occidentem, in cunctis operibus Domini, et in ministerium regis.
31 Hebronitarum autem princeps fuit Jeria secundum familias et cognationes eorum. Quadragesimo anno regni David recensiti sunt, et inventi sunt viri fortissimi in Jazer Galaad,
32 fratresque ejus robustioris ætatis, duo millia septingenti principes familiarum. Præposuit autem eos David rex Rubenitis, et Gadditis, et dimidiæ tribui Manasse, in omne ministerium Dei et regis.
