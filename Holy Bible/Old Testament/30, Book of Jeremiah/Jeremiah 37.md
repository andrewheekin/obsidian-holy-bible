# Book of Jeremiah 37 (RSVCE)

### Zedekiah’s Vain Hope
1 Zedekiʹah the son of Josiʹah, whom Nebuchadrezʹzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of Coniʹah the son of Jehoiʹakim.
2 But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of theLordwhich he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
3 King Zedekiʹah sent Jehuʹcal the son of Shelemiʹah, and Zephaniʹah the priest, the son of Ma-aseiʹah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Pray for us to theLordour God.”
4 Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.
5 The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeʹans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
6 Then the word of theLordcame to Jeremiah the prophet:
7 “Thus says theLord, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me, ‘Behold, Pharaoh’s army which came to help you is about to return to Egypt, to its own land.
8 And the Chaldeʹans shall come back and fight against this city; they shall take it and burn it with fire.
9 Thus says theLord, Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeʹans will surely stay away from us,” for they will not stay away.
10 For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeʹans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.’ ”
### Jeremiah Is Imprisoned
11 Now when the Chaldeʹan army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh’s army,
12 Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people.
13 When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Iriʹjah the son of Shelemiʹah, son of Hananiʹah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeʹans.”
14 And Jeremiah said, “It is false; I am not deserting to the Chaldeʹans.” But Iriʹjah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes.
15 And the princes were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.
16 When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells, and remained there many days,
17 King Zedekiʹah sent for him, and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house, and said, “Is there any word from theLord?” Jeremiah said, “There is.” Then he said, “You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”
18 Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiʹah, “What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?
19 Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’?
20 Now hear, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you, and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there.”
21 So King Zedekiʹah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers’ street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.


# Prophetia Jeremiae 37 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et regnavit rex Sedecias filius Josiæ pro Jechonia filio Joakim, quem constituit regem Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis in terra Juda:
2 et non obedivit ipse, et servi ejus, et populus terræ, verbis Domini, quæ locutus est in manu Jeremiæ prophetæ.
3 Et misit rex Sedecias Juchal filium Selemiæ, et Sophoniam filium Maasiæ, sacerdotem, ad Jeremiam prophetam, dicens: Ora pro nobis Dominum Deum nostrum.
4 Jeremias autem libere ambulabat in medio populi: non enim miserant eum in custodiam carceris.
5 Igitur exercitus Pharaonis egressus est de Ægypto, et audientes Chaldæi qui obsidebant Jerusalem, hujuscemodi nuntium, recesserunt ab Jerusalem.
6 Et factum est verbum Domini ad Jeremiam prophetam, dicens:
7 Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Sic dicetis regi Juda, qui misit vos ad me interrogandum: Ecce exercitus Pharaonis, qui egressus est vobis in auxilium, revertetur in terram suam in Ægyptum:
8 et redient Chaldæi, et bellabunt contra civitatem hanc, et capient eam, et succendent eam igni.
9 Hæc dicit Dominus: Nolite decipere animas vestras, dicentes: Euntes abibunt, et recedent a nobis Chaldæi: quia non abibunt.

10 Sed etsi percusseritis omnem exercitum Chaldæorum qui præliantur adversum vos, et derelicti fuerint ex eis aliqui vulnerati, singuli de tentorio suo consurgent, et incendent civitatem hanc igni.
11 Ergo cum recessisset exercitus Chaldæorum ab Jerusalem, propter exercitum Pharaonis,
12 egressus est Jeremias de Jerusalem ut iret in terram Benjamin, et divideret ibi possessionem in conspectu civium.
13 Cumque pervenisset ad portam Benjamin, erat ibi custos portæ per vices, nomine Jerias filius Selemiæ filii Hananiæ: et apprehendit Jeremiam prophetam, dicens: Ad Chaldæos profugis.
14 Et respondit Jeremias: Falsum est: non fugio ad Chaldæos. Et non audivit eum, sed comprehendit Jerias Jeremiam, et adduxit eum ad principes:
15 quam ob rem irati principes contra Jeremiam, cæsum eum miserunt in carcerem qui erat in domo Jonathan scribæ: ipse enim præpositus erat super carcerem.

16 Itaque ingressus est Jeremias in domum laci et in ergastulum: et sedit ibi Jeremias diebus multis.
17 Mittens autem Sedecias rex, tulit eum: et interrogavit eum in domo sua abscondite, et dixit: Putasne est sermo a Domino? Et dixit Jeremias: Est: et ait: In manus regis Babylonis traderis.
18 Et dixit Jeremias ad regem Sedeciam: Quid peccavi tibi, et servis tuis, et populo tuo, quia misisti me in domum carceris?
19 ubi sunt prophetæ vestri, qui prophetabant vobis, et dicebant: Non veniet rex Babylonis super vos, et super terram hanc?
20 Nunc ergo audi, obsecro, domine mi rex: valeat deprecatio mea in conspectu tuo, et ne me remittas in domum Jonathan scribæ, ne moriar ibi.


# Ἱερεμίας 37 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Σεδεκιας υἱὸς Ιωσια ἀντὶ Ιωακιμ ὃν ἐβασίλευσεν Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεύειν τοῦ Ιουδα
2 καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τοὺς λόγους κυρίου οὓς ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ Ιερεμιου
3 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σεδεκιας τὸν Ιωαχαλ υἱὸν Σελεμιου καὶ τὸν Σοφονιαν υἱὸν Μαασαιου τὸν ἱερέα πρὸς Ιερεμιαν λέγων πρόσευξαι δὴ περὶ ἡμῶν πρὸς κύριον
4 καὶ Ιερεμιας ἦλθεν καὶ διῆλθεν διὰ μέσου τῆς πόλεως καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκαν αὐτὸν εἰς οἶκον τῆς φυλακῆς
5 καὶ δύναμις Φαραω ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι τὴν ἀκοὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνέβησαν ἀπὸ Ιερουσαλημ
6 καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος κυρίου πρὸς Ιερεμιαν λέγων
7 οὕτως εἶπεν κύριος οὕτως ἐρεῖς πρὸς βασιλέα Ιουδα τὸν ἀποστείλαντα πρὸς σὲ τοῦ ἐκζητῆσαί με ἰδοὺ δύναμις Φαραω ἡ ἐξελθοῦσα ὑμῖν εἰς βοήθειαν ἀποστρέψουσιν εἰς γῆν Αἰγύπτου
8 καὶ ἀναστρέψουσιν αὐτοὶ οἱ Χαλδαῖοι καὶ πολεμήσουσιν ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην καὶ συλλήμψονται αὐτὴν καὶ καύσουσιν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί
9 ὅτι οὕτως εἶπεν κύριος μὴ ὑπολάβητε ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν λέγοντες ἀποτρέχοντες ἀπελεύσονται ἀ{F'} ἡμῶν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἀπέλθωσιν

10 καὶ ἐὰν πατάξητε πᾶσαν δύναμιν τῶν Χαλδαίων τοὺς πολεμοῦντας ὑμᾶς καὶ καταλειφθῶσίν τινες ἐκκεκεντημένοι ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ τόπῳ αὐτοῦ οὗτοι ἀναστήσονται καὶ καύσουσιν τὴν πόλιν ταύτην ἐν πυρί
11 καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε ἀνέβη ἡ δύναμις τῶν Χαλδαίων ἀπὸ Ιερουσαλημ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς δυνάμεως Φαραω
12 ἐξῆλθεν Ιερεμιας ἀπὸ Ιερουσαλημ τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς γῆν Βενιαμιν τοῦ ἀγοράσαι ἐκεῖθεν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ
13 καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτὸς ἐν πύλῃ Βενιαμιν καὶ ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος πα{R'} ᾧ κατέλυεν Σαρουιας υἱὸς Σελεμιου υἱοῦ Ανανιου καὶ συνέλαβεν τὸν Ιερεμιαν λέγων πρὸς τοὺς Χαλδαίους σὺ φεύγεις
14 καὶ εἶπεν ψεῦδος οὐκ εἰς τοὺς Χαλδαίους ἐγὼ φεύγω καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν αὐτοῦ καὶ συνέλαβεν Σαρουιας τὸν Ιερεμιαν καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας
15 καὶ ἐπικράνθησαν οἱ ἄρχοντες ἐπὶ Ιερεμιαν καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπέστειλαν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν Ιωναθαν τοῦ γραμματέως ὅτι ταύτην ἐποίησαν εἰς οἰκίαν φυλακῆς

16 καὶ ἦλθεν Ιερεμιας εἰς οἰκίαν τοῦ λάκκου καὶ εἰς τὴν χερεθ καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας πολλάς
17 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σεδεκιας καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτόν καὶ ἠρώτα αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς κρυφαίως εἰπεῖν εἰ ἔστιν λόγος παρὰ κυρίου καὶ εἶπεν ἔστιν εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος παραδοθήσῃ
18 καὶ εἶπεν Ιερεμιας τῷ βασιλεῖ τί ἠδίκησά σε καὶ τοὺς παῖδάς σου καὶ τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον ὅτι σὺ δίδως με εἰς οἰκίαν φυλακῆς
19 καὶ ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ προφῆται ὑμῶν οἱ προφητεύσαντες ὑμῖν λέγοντες ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἔλθῃ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ταύτην
20 καὶ νῦν κύριε βασιλεῦ πεσέτω τὸ ἔλεός μου κατὰ πρόσωπόν σου καὶ τί ἀποστρέφεις με εἰς οἰκίαν Ιωναθαν τοῦ γραμματέως καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνω ἐκεῖ
