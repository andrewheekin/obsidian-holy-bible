# Book of Jeremiah 52 (RSVCE)

### The Destruction of Jerusalem Reviewed
1 Zedekiʹah was twenty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamuʹtal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 And he did what was evil in the sight of theLord, according to all that Jehoiʹakim had done.
3 Surely because of the anger of theLordthings came to such a pass in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiʹah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
4 And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadrezʹzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and they laid siege to it and built siegeworks against it round about.
5 So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiʹah.
6 On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city, that there was no food for the people of the land.
7 Then a breach was made in the city; and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls, by the king’s garden, while the Chaldeʹans were round about the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah.
8 But the army of the Chaldeʹans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiʹah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
9 Then they captured the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence upon him.
10 The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiʹah before his eyes, and also slew all the princes of Judah at Riblah.
11 He put out the eyes of Zedekiʹah, and bound him in fetters, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
12 In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month—which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadrezʹzar, king of Babylon—Nebuʹzaradʹan the captain of the bodyguard who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
13 And he burned the house of theLord, and the king’s house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
14 And all the army of the Chaldeʹans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls round about Jerusalem.
15 And Nebuʹzaradʹan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans.
16 But Nebuʹzaradʹan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
17 And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of theLord, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of theLord, the Chaldeʹans broke in pieces, and carried all the bronze to Babylon.
18 And they took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the dishes for incense, and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service;
19 also the small bowls, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the dishes for incense, and the bowls for libation. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver.
20 As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze bulls which were under the sea, and the stands, which Solomon the king had made for the house of theLord, the bronze of all these things was beyond weight.
21 As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference was twelve cubits, and its thickness was four fingers, and it was hollow.
22 Upon it was a capital of bronze; the height of the one capital was five cubits; a network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were upon the capital round about. And the second pillar had the like, with pomegranates.
23 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.
24 And the captain of the guard took Seraiʹah the chief priest, and Zephaniʹah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;
25 and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and seven men of the king’s council, who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.
26 And Nebuʹzaradʹan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried captive out of its land.
28 This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadrezʹzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;
29 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezʹzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;
30 in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezʹzar, Nebuʹzaradʹan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons; all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
### Jehoiachin Favored in Captivity
31 And in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiʹachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-meʹrodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, lifted up the head of Jehoiʹachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison;
32 and he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
33 So Jehoiʹachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king’s table;
34 as for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king according to his daily need, until the day of his death as long as he lived.


# Prophetia Jeremiae 52 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Filius viginti et unius anni erat Sedecias cum regnare cœpisset, et undecim annis regnavit in Jerusalem. Et nomen matris ejus Amital filia Jeremiæ de Lobna.
2 Et fecit malum in oculis Domini, juxta omnia quæ fecerat Joakim,
3 quoniam furor Domini erat in Jerusalem et in Juda, usquequo projiceret eos a facie sua: et recessit Sedecias a rege Babylonis.

4 Factum est autem in anno nono regni ejus, in mense decimo, decima mensis, venit Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis, ipse et omnis exercitus ejus, adversus Jerusalem: et obsederunt eam, et ædificaverunt contra eam munitiones in circuitu.
5 Et fuit civitas obsessa usque ad undecimum annum regis Sedeciæ.
6 Mense autem quarto, nona mensis, obtinuit fames civitatem, et non erant alimenta populo terræ.
7 Et dirupta est civitas, et omnes viri bellatores ejus fugerunt, exieruntque de civitate nocte, per viam portæ quæ est inter duos muros, et ducit ad hortum regis, Chaldæis obsidentibus urbem in gyro, et abierunt per viam quæ ducit in eremum.
8 Persecutus est autem Chadæorum exercitus regem, et apprehenderunt Sedeciam in deserto quod est juxta Jericho: et omnis comitatus ejus diffugit ab eo.
9 Cumque comprehendissent regem, adduxerunt eum ad regem Babylonis in Reblatha, quæ est in terra Emath, et locutus est ad eum judicia.
10 Et jugulavit rex Babylonis filios Sedeciæ in oculis ejus, sed et omnes principes Juda occidit in Reblatha.
11 Et oculos Sedeciæ eruit, et vinxit eum compedibus, et adduxit eum rex Babylonis in Babylonem, et posuit eum in domo carceris usque ad diem mortis ejus.

12 In mense autem quinto, decima mensis, ipse est annus nonusdecimus Nabuchodonosor regis Babylonis, venit Nabuzardan princeps militiæ, qui stabat coram rege Babylonis, in Jerusalem,
13 et incendit domum Domini, et domum regis, et omnes domos Jerusalem: et omnem domum magnam igni combussit:
14 et totum murum Jerusalem per circuitum destruxit cunctus exercitus Chaldæorum qui erat cum magistro militiæ.
15 De pauperibus autem populi, et de reliquo vulgo quod remanserat in civitate, et de perfugis qui transfugerant ad regem Babylonis, et ceteros de multitudine transtulit Nabuzardan princeps militiæ.
16 De pauperibus vero terræ reliquit Nabuzardan princeps militiæ vinitores et agricolas.
17 Columnas quoque æreas quæ erant in domo Domini, et bases, et mare æneum quod erat in domo Domini, confregerunt Chaldæi, et tulerunt omne æs eorum in Babylonem,
18 et lebetes, et creagras, et psalteria, et phialas, et mortariola, et omnia vasa ærea quæ in ministerio fuerant, tulerunt:
19 et hydrias, et thymiamateria, et urceos, et pelves, et candelabra, et mortaria, et cyathos, quotquot aurea, aurea, et quotquot argentea, argentea, tulit magister militiæ:
20 et columnas duas, et mare unum, et vitulos duodecim æreos qui erant sub basibus quas fecerat rex Salomon in domo Domini. Non erat pondus æris omnium horum vasorum.
21 De columnis autem decem et octo cubiti altitudinis erant in columna una, et funiculus duodecim cubitorum circuibat eam: porro grossitudo ejus quatuor digitorum, et intrinsecus cava erat.
22 Et capitella super utramque ærea: altitudo capitelli unius quinque cubitorum, et retiacula et malogranata super coronam in circuitu, omnia ærea: similiter columnæ secundæ, et malogranata.
23 Et fuerunt malogranata nonaginta sex dependentia: et omnia malogranata centum, retiaculis circumdabantur.

24 Et tulit magister militiæ Saraiam sacerdotem primum, et Sophoniam sacerdotem secundum, et tres custodes vestibuli:
25 et de civitate tulit eunuchum unum, qui erat præpositus super viros bellatores: et septem viros de his qui videbant faciem regis, qui inventi sunt in civitate: et scribam principem militum, qui probabat tyrones: et sexaginta viros de populo terræ, qui inventi sunt in medio civitatis.
26 Tulit autem eos Nabuzardan magister militiæ, et duxit eos ad regem Babylonis in Reblatha:
27 et percussit eos rex Babylonis, et interfecit eos in Reblatha in terra Emath: et translatus est Juda de terra sua.
28 Iste est populus quem transtulit Nabuchodonosor: in anno septimo, Judæos tria millia et viginti tres:
29 in anno octavodecimo Nabuchodonosor, de Jerusalem animas octingentas triginta duas:
30 in anno vigesimo tertio Nabuchodonosor, transtulit Nabuzardan magister militiæ animas Judæorum septingentas quadraginta quinque. Omnes ergo animæ, quatuor millia sexcentæ.

31 Et factum est in trigesimo septimo anno transmigrationis Joachin regis Juda, duodecimo mense, vigesima quinta mensis, elevavit Evilmerodach rex Babylonis, ipso anno regni sui, caput Joachin regis Juda, et eduxit eum de domo carceris.
32 Et locutus est cum eo bona, et posuit thronum ejus super thronos regum qui erant post se in Babylone.
33 Et mutavit vestimenta carceris ejus, et comedebat panem coram eo semper cunctis diebus vitæ suæ.
34 Et cibaria ejus, cibaria perpetua dabantur ei a rege Babylonis, statuta per singulos dies, usque ad diem mortis suæ, cunctis diebus vitæ ejus.
