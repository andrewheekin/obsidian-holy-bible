# Book of Jeremiah 39 (RSVCE)

### The Fall of Jerusalem
1 In the ninth year of Zedekiʹah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadrezʹzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it;
2 in the eleventh year of Zedekiʹah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city.
3 When Jerusalem was taken, all the princes of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle gate: Nerʹgal-shareʹzer, Samʹgar-neʹbo, Sarʹsechim the Rabʹsaris, Nerʹgal-shareʹzer the Rabmag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon.
4 When Zedekiʹah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah.
5 But the army of the Chaldeʹans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiʹah in the plains of Jericho; and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezʹzar king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence upon him.
6 The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiʹah at Riblah before his eyes; and the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
7 He put out the eyes of Zedekiʹah, and bound him in fetters to take him to Babylon.
8 The Chaldeʹans burned the king’s house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
9 Then Nebuʹzaradʹan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained.
10 Nebuʹzaradʹan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
### Jeremiah, Set Free, Remembers Ebed-melech
11 Nebuchadrezʹzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuʹzaradʹan, the captain of the guard, saying,
12 “Take him, look after him well and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you.”
13 So Nebuʹzaradʹan the captain of the guard, Nebushazʹban the Rabʹsaris, Nerʹgal-shareʹzer the Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon
14 sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliʹah the son of Ahiʹkam, son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he dwelt among the people.
15 The word of theLordcame to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard:
16 “Go, and say to Eʹbed-melʹech the Ethiopian, ‘Thus says theLordof hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will fulfil my words against this city for evil and not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day.
17 But I will deliver you on that day, says theLord, and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
18 For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me, says theLord.’ ”


# Prophetia Jeremiae 39 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Anno nono Sedeciæ regis Juda, mense decimo, venit Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis, et omnis exercitus ejus, ad Jerusalem, et obsidebant eam.
2 Undecimo autem anno Sedeciæ, mense quarto, quinta mensis, aperta est civitas:
3 et ingressi sunt omnes principes regis Babylonis, et sederunt in porta media: Neregel, Sereser, Semegarnabu, Sarsachim, Rabsares, Neregel, Sereser, Rebmag, et omnes reliqui principes regis Babylonis.
4 Cumque vidisset eos Sedecias rex Juda, et omnes viri bellatores, fugerunt: et egressi sunt nocte de civitate per viam horti regis, et per portam quæ erat inter duos muros, et egressi sunt ad viam deserti.
5 Persecutus est autem eos exercitus Chaldæorum, et comprehenderunt Sedeciam in campo solitudinis Jerichontinæ, et captum adduxerunt ad Nabuchodonosor regem Babylonis, in Reblatha, quæ est in terra Emath: et locutus est ad eum judicia.
6 Et occidit rex Babylonis filios Sedeciæ in Reblatha, in oculis ejus: et omnes nobiles Juda occidit rex Babylonis.
7 Oculos quoque Sedeciæ eruit, et vinxit eum compedibus ut duceretur in Babylonem.
8 Domum quoque regis et domum vulgi succenderunt Chaldæi igni, et murum Jerusalem subverterunt.
9 Et reliquias populi qui remanserant in civitate, et perfugas qui transfugerant ad eum, et superfluos vulgi qui remanserant, transtulit Nabuzardan, magister militum, in Babylonem.
10 Et de plebe pauperum, qui nihil penitus habebant, dimisit Nabuzardan magister militum in terra Juda, et dedit eis vineas et cisternas in die illa.

11 Præceperat autem Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis de Jeremia Nabuzardan magistro militum, dicens:
12 Tolle illum, et pone super eum oculos tuos, nihilque ei mali facias: sed ut voluerit, sic facias ei.
13 Misit ergo Nabuzardan princeps militiæ, et Nabusezban, et Rabsares, et Neregel, et Sereser, et Rebmag, et omnes optimates regis Babylonis,
14 miserunt, et tulerunt Jeremiam de vestibulo carceris, et tradiderunt eum Godoliæ filio Ahicam filii Saphan, ut intraret in domum, et habitaret in populo.

15 Ad Jeremiam autem factus fuerat sermo Domini, cum clausus esset in vestibulo carceris, dicens:
16 Vade, et dic Abdemelech Æthiopi, dicens: Hæc dicit Dominus exercituum, Deus Israël: Ecce ego inducam sermones meos super civitatem hanc in malum, et non in bonum, et erunt in conspectu tuo in die illa.
17 Et liberabo te in die illa, ait Dominus, et non traderis in manus virorum quos tu formidas:
18 sed eruens liberabo te, et gladio non cades, sed erit tibi anima tua in salutem, quia in me habuisti fiduciam, ait Dominus.
