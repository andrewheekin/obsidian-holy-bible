# Book of Jeremiah 38 (RSVCE)

### Jeremiah in the Cistern
1 Now Shephatiʹah the son of Mattan, Gedaliʹah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiʹah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiʹah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people,
2 “Thus says theLord, He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes out to the Chaldeʹans shall live; he shall have his life as a prize of war, and live.
3 Thus says theLord, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken.”
4 Then the princes said to the king, “Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.”
5 King Zedekiʹah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.”
6 So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiʹah, the king’s son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
### Jeremiah Is Rescued by Ebed-melech
7 When Eʹbed-melʹech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern—the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate—
8 Eʹbed-melʹech went from the king’s house and said to the king,
9 “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern; and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city.”
10 Then the king commanded Eʹbed-melʹech, the Ethiopian, “Take three men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”
11 So Eʹbed-melʹech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe of the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes.
12 Then Eʹbed-melʹech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes.” Jeremiah did so.
13 Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
### Zedekiah Consults Jeremiah Again
14 King Zedekiʹah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of theLord. The king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me.”
15 Jeremiah said to Zedekiʹah, “If I tell you, will you not be sure to put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.”
16 Then King Zedekiʹah swore secretly to Jeremiah, “As theLordlives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life.”
17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiʹah, “Thus says theLord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, If you will surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live.
18 But if you do not surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeʹans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.”
19 King Zedekiʹah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeʹans, lest I be handed over to them and they abuse me.”
20 Jeremiah said, “You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of theLordin what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared.
21 But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which theLordhas shown to me:
22 Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the princes of the king of Babylon and were saying, ‘Your trusted friends have deceived you and prevailed against you; now that your feet are sunk in the mire, they turn away from you.’
23 All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeʹans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon; and this city shall be burned with fire.”
24 Then Zedekiʹah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words and you shall not die.
25 If the princes hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,’
26 then you shall say to them, ‘I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.’ ”
27 Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they left off speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard.
28 And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.


# Prophetia Jeremiae 38 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Audivit autem Saphatias filius Mathan, et Gedelias filius Phassur, et Juchal filius Selemiæ, et Phassur filius Melchiæ, sermones quos Jeremias loquebatur ad omnem populum, dicens:
2 Hæc dicit Dominus: Quicumque manserit in civitate hac, morietur gladio, et fame, et peste: qui autem profugerit ad Chaldæos, vivet, et erit anima ejus sospes et vivens.
3 Hæc dicit Dominus: Tradendo tradetur civitas hæc in manu exercitus regis Babylonis, et capiet eam.
4 Et dixerunt principes regi: Rogamus ut occidatur homo iste: de industria enim dissolvit manus virorum bellantium qui remanserunt in civitate hac, et manus universi populi, loquens ad eos juxta verba hæc: siquidem homo iste non quærit pacem populo huic, sed malum.
5 Et dixit rex Sedecias: Ecce ipse in manibus vestris est: nec enim fas est regem vobis quidquam negare.
6 Tulerunt ergo Jeremiam, et projecerunt eum in lacum Melchiæ filii Amelech, qui erat in vestibulo carceris: et submiserunt Jeremiam funibus in lacum, in quo non erat aqua, sed lutum: descendit itaque Jeremias in cœnum.

7 Audivit autem Abdemelech Æthiops, vir eunuchus, qui erat in domo regis, quod misissent Jeremiam in lacum. Porro rex sedebat in porta Benjamin:
8 et egressus est Abdemelech de domo regis, et locutus est ad regem, dicens:
9 Domine mi rex, male fecerunt viri isti omnia quæcumque perpetrarunt contra Jeremiam prophetam, mittentes eum in lacum, ut moriatur ibi fame: non sunt enim panes ultra in civitate.
10 Præcepit itaque rex Abdemelech Æthiopi, dicens: Tolle tecum hinc triginta viros, et leva Jeremiam prophetam de lacu, antequam moriatur.
11 Assumptis ergo Abdemelech secum viris, ingressus est domum regis, quæ erat sub cellario, et tulit inde veteres pannos, et antiqua quæ computruerant, et submisit ea ad Jeremiam in lacum per funiculos.
12 Dixitque Abdemelech Æthiops ad Jeremiam: Pone veteres pannos, et hæc scissa et putrida, sub cubito manuum tuarum, et super funes. Fecit ergo Jeremias sic,
13 et extraxerunt Jeremiam funibus, et eduxerunt eum de lacu: mansit autem Jeremias in vestibulo carceris.

14 Et misit rex Sedecias, et tulit ad se Jeremiam prophetam ad ostium tertium quod erat in domo Domini: et dixit rex ad Jeremiam: Interrogo ego te sermonem, ne abscondas a me aliquid.
15 Dixit autem Jeremias ad Sedeciam: Si annuntiavero tibi, numquid non interficies me? et si consilium dedero tibi, non me audies.
16 Juravit ergo rex Sedecias Jeremiæ clam, dicens: Vivit Dominus, qui fecit nobis animam hanc, si occidero te, et si tradidero te in manus virorum istorum qui quærunt animam tuam.
17 Et dixit Jeremias ad Sedeciam: Hæc dicit Dominus exercituum, Deus Israël: Si profectus exieris ad principes regis Babylonis, vivet anima tua, et civitas hæc non succendetur igni: et salvus eris tu, et domus tua.
18 Si autem non exieris ad principes regis Babylonis, tradetur civitas hæc in manus Chaldæorum, et succendent eam igni: et tu non effugies de manu eorum.
19 Et dixit rex Sedecias ad Jeremiam: Sollicitus sum propter Judæos qui transfugerunt ad Chaldæos, ne forte tradar in manus eorum, et illudant mihi.
20 Respondit autem Jeremias: Non te tradent. Audi, quæso, vocem Domini, quam ego loquor ad te, et bene tibi erit, et vivet anima tua.
21 Quod si nolueris egredi, iste est sermo quem ostendit mihi Dominus:
22 ecce omnes mulieres quæ remanserunt in domo regis Juda educentur ad principes regis Babylonis, et ipsæ dicent: Seduxerunt te, et prævaluerunt adversum te, viri pacifici tui: demerserunt in cœno et in lubrico pedes tuos, et recesserunt a te.
23 Et omnes uxores tuæ et filii tui educentur ad Chaldæos: et non effugies manus eorum, sed in manu regis Babylonis capieris, et civitatem hanc comburet igni.

24 Dixit ergo Sedecias ad Jeremiam: Nullus sciat verba hæc, et non morieris.
25 Si autem audierint principes quia locutus sum tecum, et venerint ad te, et dixerint tibi: Indica nobis quid locutus sis cum rege: ne celes nos, et non te interficiemus: et quid locutus est tecum rex:
26 dices ad eos: Prostravi ego preces meas coram rege, ne me reduci juberet in domum Jonathan, et ibi morerer.
27 Venerunt ergo omnes principes ad Jeremiam, et interrogaverunt eum, et locutus est eis juxta omnia verba quæ præceperat ei rex: et cessaverunt ab eo: nihil enim fuerat auditum.
28 Mansit vero Jeremias in vestibulo carceris usque ad diem quo capta est Jerusalem: et factum est ut caperetur Jerusalem.


# Ἱερεμίας 38 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἤκουσεν Σαφατιας υἱὸς Μαθαν καὶ Γοδολιας υἱὸς Πασχωρ καὶ Ιωαχαλ υἱὸς Σελεμιου τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἐλάλει Ιερεμιας ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν λέγων
2 οὕτως εἶπεν κύριος ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ ἀποθανεῖται ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ ἐν λιμῷ καὶ ὁ ἐκπορευόμενος πρὸς τοὺς Χαλδαίους ζήσεται καὶ ἔσται ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς εὕρεμα καὶ ζήσεται
3 ὅτι οὕτως εἶπεν κύριος παραδιδομένη παραδοθήσεται ἡ πόλις αὕτη εἰς χεῖρας δυνάμεως βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος καὶ συλλήμψεται αὐτήν
4 καὶ εἶπαν τῷ βασιλεῖ ἀναιρεθήτω δὴ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος ὅτι αὐτὸς ἐκλύει τὰς χεῖρας τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῶν πολεμούντων τῶν καταλειπομένων ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ τὰς χεῖρας παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ λαλῶν πρὸς αὐτοὺς κατὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους ὅτι ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗτος οὐ χρησμολογεῖ εἰρήνην τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ ἀλ{L'} ἢ πονηρά
5 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἐν χερσὶν ὑμῶν ὅτι οὐκ ἠδύνατο ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς αὐτούς
6 καὶ ἔρριψαν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν λάκκον Μελχιου υἱοῦ τοῦ βασιλέως ὃς ἦν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς φυλακῆς καὶ ἐχάλασαν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν λάκκον καὶ ἐν τῷ λάκκῳ οὐκ ἦν ὕδωρ ἀλ{L'} ἢ βόρβορος καὶ ἦν ἐν τῷ βορβόρῳ

7 καὶ ἤκουσεν Αβδεμελεχ ὁ Αἰθίοψ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν οἰκίᾳ τοῦ βασιλέως ὅτι ἔδωκαν Ιερεμιαν εἰς τὸν λάκκον καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἦν ἐν τῇ πύλῃ Βενιαμιν
8 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ εἶπεν
9 ἐπονηρεύσω ἃ ἐποίησας τοῦ ἀποκτεῖναι τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦτον ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ λιμοῦ ὅτι οὐκ εἰσὶν ἔτι ἄρτοι ἐν τῇ πόλει
10 καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Αβδεμελεχ λέγων λαβὲ εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου ἐντεῦθεν τριάκοντα ἀνθρώπους καὶ ἀνάγαγε αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου ἵνα μὴ ἀποθάνῃ
11 καὶ ἔλαβεν Αβδεμελεχ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ βασιλέως τὴν ὑπόγειον καὶ ἔλαβεν ἐκεῖθεν παλαιὰ ῥάκη καὶ παλαιὰ σχοινία καὶ ἔρριψεν αὐτὰ πρὸς Ιερεμιαν εἰς τὸν λάκκον
12 καὶ εἶπεν ταῦτα θὲς ὑποκάτω τῶν σχοινίων καὶ ἐποίησεν Ιερεμιας οὕτως
13 καὶ εἵλκυσαν αὐτὸν τοῖς σχοινίοις καὶ ἀνήγαγον αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου καὶ ἐκάθισεν Ιερεμιας ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς φυλακῆς

14 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν πρὸς ἑαυτὸν εἰς οἰκίαν ασελισι τὴν ἐν οἴκῳ κυρίου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς ἐρωτήσω σε λόγον καὶ μὴ δὴ κρύψῃς ἀ{P'} ἐμοῦ ῥῆμα
15 καὶ εἶπεν Ιερεμιας τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐὰν ἀναγγείλω σοι οὐχὶ θανάτῳ με θανατώσεις καὶ ἐὰν συμβουλεύσω σοι οὐ μὴ ἀκούσῃς μου
16 καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεὺς λέγων ζῇ κύριος ὃς ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν τὴν ψυχὴν ταύτην εἰ ἀποκτενῶ σε καὶ εἰ δώσω σε εἰς χεῖρας τῶν ἀνθρώπων τούτων
17 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ιερεμιας οὕτως εἶπεν κύριος ἐὰν ἐξελθὼν ἐξέλθῃς πρὸς ἡγεμόνας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος καὶ ζήσεται ἡ ψυχή σου καὶ ἡ πόλις αὕτη οὐ μὴ κατακαυθῇ ἐν πυρί καὶ ζήσῃ σὺ καὶ ἡ οἰκία σου
18 καὶ ἐὰν μὴ ἐξέλθῃς δοθήσεται ἡ πόλις αὕτη εἰς χεῖρας τῶν Χαλδαίων καὶ καύσουσιν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί καὶ σὺ οὐ μὴ σωθῇς
19 καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Ιερεμια ἐγὼ λόγον ἔχω τῶν Ιουδαίων τῶν πεφευγότων πρὸς τοὺς Χαλδαίους μὴ δώσειν με εἰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν καὶ καταμωκήσονταί μου
20 καὶ εἶπεν Ιερεμιας οὐ μὴ παραδῶσίν σε ἄκουσον τὸν λόγον κυρίου ὃν ἐγὼ λέγω πρὸς σέ καὶ βέλτιον ἔσται σοι καὶ ζήσεται ἡ ψυχή σου
21 καὶ εἰ μὴ θέλεις σὺ ἐξελθεῖν οὗτος ὁ λόγος ὃν ἔδειξέν μοι κύριος
22 καὶ ἰδοὺ πᾶσαι αἱ γυναῖκες αἱ καταλειφθεῖσαι ἐν οἰκίᾳ βασιλέως Ιουδα ἐξήγοντο πρὸς ἄρχοντας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος καὶ αὗται ἔλεγον ἠπάτησάν σε καὶ δυνήσονταί σοι ἄνδρες εἰρηνικοί σου καὶ καταλύσουσιν ἐν ὀλισθήμασιν πόδας σου ἀπέστρεψαν ἀπὸ σοῦ
23 καὶ τὰς γυναῖκάς σου καὶ τὰ τέκνα σου ἐξάξουσιν πρὸς τοὺς Χαλδαίους καὶ σὺ οὐ μὴ σωθῇς ὅτι ἐν χειρὶ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος συλλημφθήσῃ καὶ ἡ πόλις αὕτη κατακαυθήσεται

24 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς ἄνθρωπος μὴ γνώτω ἐκ τῶν λόγων τούτων καὶ σὺ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνῃς
25 καὶ ἐὰν ἀκούσωσιν οἱ ἄρχοντες ὅτι ἐλάλησά σοι καὶ ἔλθωσιν πρὸς σὲ καὶ εἴπωσίν σοι ἀνάγγειλον ἡμῖν τί ἐλάλησέν σοι ὁ βασιλεύς μὴ κρύψῃς ἀ{F'} ἡμῶν καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀνέλωμέν σε καὶ τί ἐλάλησεν πρὸς σὲ ὁ βασιλεύς
26 καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς ῥίπτω ἐγὼ τὸ ἔλεός μου κα{T'} ὀφθαλμοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἀποστρέψαι με εἰς οἰκίαν Ιωναθαν ἀποθανεῖν ἐκεῖ
27 καὶ ἤλθοσαν πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες πρὸς Ιερεμιαν καὶ ἠρώτησαν αὐτόν καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς κατὰ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους οὓς ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς καὶ ἀπεσιώπησαν ὅτι οὐκ ἠκούσθη λόγος κυρίου
28 καὶ ἐκάθισεν Ιερεμιας ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς φυλακῆς ἕως χρόνου οὗ συνελήμφθη Ιερουσαλημ
