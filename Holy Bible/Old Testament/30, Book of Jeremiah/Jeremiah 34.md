# Book of Jeremiah 34 (RSVCE)

### Death in Captivity Predicted for Zedekiah
1 The word which came to Jeremiah from theLord, when Nebuchadrezʹzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities:
2 “Thus says theLord, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiʹah king of Judah and say to him, ‘Thus says theLord: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
3 You shall not escape from his hand, but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand; you shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face; and you shall go to Babylon.’
4 Yet hear the word of theLord, O Zedekiʹah king of Judah! Thus says theLordconcerning you: ‘You shall not die by the sword.
5 You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so men shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, “Alas, lord!” ’ For I have spoken the word, says theLord.”
6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiʹah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
7 when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azeʹkah; for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained.
### Treacherous Treatment of Slaves
8 The word which came to Jeremiah from theLord, after King Zedekiʹah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them,
9 that every one should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother.
10 And they obeyed, all the princes and all the people who had entered into the covenant that every one would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again; they obeyed and set them free.
11 But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves.
12 The word of theLordcame to Jeremiah from theLord:
13 “Thus says theLord, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
14 ‘At the end of six years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must set him free from your service.’ But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me.
15 You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name;
16 but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.
17 Therefore, thus says theLord: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, says theLord. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
18 And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant which they made before me, I will make like the calf which they cut in two and passed between its parts—
19 the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf;
20 and I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
21 And Zedekiʹah king of Judah, and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you.
22 Behold, I will command, says theLord, and will bring them back to this city; and they will fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.”


# Prophetia Jeremiae 34 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Verbum quod factum est ad Jeremiam a Domino quando Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis, et omnis exercitus ejus, universaque regna terræ quæ erant sub potestate manus ejus, et omnes populi, bellabant contra Jerusalem, et contra omnes urbes ejus, dicens:
2 Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Vade, et loquere ad Sedeciam regem Juda, et dices ad eum: Hæc dicit Dominus: Ecce ego tradam civitatem hanc in manus regis Babylonis, et succendet eam igni:
3 et tu non effugies de manu ejus, sed comprehensione capieris, et in manu ejus traderis: et oculi tui oculos regis Babylonis videbunt, et os ejus cum ore tuo loquetur, et Babylonem introibis.
4 Attamen audi verbum Domini, Sedecia, rex Juda: Hæc dicit Dominus ad te: Non morieris in gladio,
5 sed in pace morieris: et secundum combustiones patrum tuorum, regum priorum qui fuerunt ante te, sic comburent te: et: Væ domine, plangent te: quia verbum ego locutus sum, dicit Dominus.
6 Et locutus est Jeremias propheta ad Sedeciam regem Juda universa verba hæc in Jerusalem.
7 Et exercitus regis Babylonis pugnabat contra Jerusalem, et contra omnes civitates Juda quæ reliquæ erant, contra Lachis et contra Azecha: hæ enim supererant de civitatibus Juda, urbes munitæ.

8 Verbum quod factum est ad Jeremiam a Domino, postquam percussit rex Sedecias fœdus cum omni populo in Jerusalem, prædicans
9 ut dimitteret unusquisque servum suum et unusquisque ancillam suam, Hebræum et Hebræam, liberos, et nequaquam dominarentur eis, id est, in Judæo et fratre suo.
10 Audierunt ergo omnes principes et universus populus qui inierant pactum ut dimitteret unusquisque servum suum et unusquisque ancillam suam liberos, et ultra non dominarentur eis: audierunt igitur, et dimiserunt.
11 Et conversi sunt deinceps: et retraxerunt servos et ancillas suas quos dimiserant liberos, et subjugaverunt in famulos et famulas.
12 Et factum est verbum Domini ad Jeremiam a Domino, dicens:
13 Hæc dicit Dominus Deus Israël: Ego percussi fœdus cum patribus vestris in die qua eduxi eos de terra Ægypti, de domo servitutis, dicens:
14 Cum completi fuerint septem anni, dimittat unusquisque fratrem suum Hebræum, qui venditus est ei: et serviet tibi sex annis, et dimittes eum a te liberum: et non audierunt patres vestri me, nec inclinaverunt aurem suam.
15 Et conversi estis vos hodie, et fecistis quod rectum est in oculis meis, ut prædicaretis libertatem unusquisque ad amicum suum: et inistis pactum in conspectu meo, in domo in qua invocatum est nomen meum super eam:
16 et reversi estis, et commaculastis nomen meum, et reduxistis unusquisque servum suum et unusquisque ancillam suam quos dimiseratis ut essent liberi et suæ potestatis, et subjugastis eos ut sint vobis servi et ancillæ.

17 Propterea hæc dicit Dominus: Vos non audistis me, ut prædicaretis libertatem unusquisque fratri suo et unusquisque amico suo: ecce ego prædico vobis libertatem, ait Dominus, ad gladium, ad pestem, et ad famem, et dabo vos in commotionem cunctis regnis terræ.
18 Et dabo viros qui prævaricantur fœdus meum, et non observaverunt verba fœderis quibus assensi sunt in conspectu meo, vitulum quem conciderunt in duas partes, et transierunt inter divisiones ejus,
19 principes Juda et principes Jerusalem, eunuchi et sacerdotes, et omnis populus terræ, qui transierunt inter divisiones vituli:
20 et dabo eos in manus inimicorum suorum, et in manus quærentium animam eorum, et erit morticinum eorum in escam volatilibus cæli et bestiis terræ.
21 Et Sedeciam regem Juda, et principes ejus, dabo in manus inimicorum suorum, et in manus quærentium animas eorum, et in manus exercituum regis Babylonis, qui recesserunt a vobis.
22 Ecce ego præcipio, dicit Dominus, et reducam eos in civitatem hanc, et præliabuntur adversus eam, et capient eam, et incendent igni: et civitates Juda dabo in solitudinem, eo quod non sit habitator.


# Ἱερεμίας 34 (Septuagint)

1 ὁ λόγος ὁ γενόμενος πρὸς Ιερεμιαν παρὰ κυρίου καὶ Ναβουχοδονοσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος καὶ πᾶν τὸ στρατόπεδον αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ ἀρχῆς αὐτοῦ ἐπολέμουν ἐπὶ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐπὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις Ιουδα λέγων
2 οὕτως εἶπεν κύριος βάδισον πρὸς Σεδεκιαν βασιλέα Ιουδα καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτῷ οὕτως εἶπεν κύριος παραδόσει παραδοθήσεται ἡ πόλις αὕτη εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος καὶ συλλήμψεται αὐτὴν καὶ καύσει αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί
3 καὶ σὺ οὐ μὴ σωθῇς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ συλλήμψει συλλημφθήσῃ καὶ εἰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ δοθήσῃ καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ὄψονται καὶ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ μετὰ τοῦ στόματός σου λαλήσει καὶ εἰς Βαβυλῶνα εἰσελεύσῃ
4 ἀλλὰ ἄκουσον τὸν λόγον κυρίου Σεδεκια βασιλεῦ Ιουδα οὕτως λέγει κύριος
5 ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἀποθανῇ καὶ ὡς ἔκλαυσαν τοὺς πατέρας σου τοὺς βασιλεύσαντας πρότερόν σου κλαύσονται καὶ σὲ καὶ ὦ αδων κόψονταί σε ὅτι λόγον ἐγὼ ἐλάλησα εἶπεν κύριος
6 καὶ ἐλάλησεν Ιερεμιας πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Σεδεκιαν πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
7 καὶ ἡ δύναμις βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος ἐπολέμει ἐπὶ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις Ιουδα ἐπὶ Λαχις καὶ ἐπὶ Αζηκα ὅτι αὗται κατελείφθησαν ἐν πόλεσιν Ιουδα πόλεις ὀχυραί

8 ὁ λόγος ὁ γενόμενος πρὸς Ιερεμιαν παρὰ κυρίου μετὰ τὸ συντελέσαι τὸν βασιλέα Σεδεκιαν διαθήκην πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τοῦ καλέσαι ἄφεσιν
9 τοῦ ἐξαποστεῖλαι ἕκαστον τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕκαστον τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ τὸν Εβραῖον καὶ τὴν Εβραίαν ἐλευθέρους πρὸς τὸ μὴ δουλεύειν ἄνδρα ἐξ Ιουδα
10 καὶ ἐπεστράφησαν πάντες οἱ μεγιστᾶνες καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς οἱ εἰσελθόντες ἐν τῇ διαθήκῃ τοῦ ἀποστεῖλαι ἕκαστον τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕκαστον τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ
11 καὶ ἔωσαν αὐτοὺς εἰς παῖδας καὶ παιδίσκας
12 καὶ ἐγενήθη λόγος κυρίου πρὸς Ιερεμιαν λέγων
13 οὕτως εἶπεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ ἐγὼ ἐθέμην διαθήκην πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐξειλάμην αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας λέγων
14 ὅταν πληρωθῇ ἓξ ἔτη ἀποστελεῖς τὸν ἀδελφόν σου τὸν Εβραῖον ὃς πραθήσεταί σοι καὶ ἐργᾶταί σοι ἓξ ἔτη καὶ ἐξαποστελεῖς αὐτὸν ἐλεύθερον καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσάν μου καὶ οὐκ ἔκλιναν τὸ οὖς αὐτῶν
15 καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν σήμερον ποιῆσαι τὸ εὐθὲς πρὸ ὀφθαλμῶν μου τοῦ καλέσαι ἄφεσιν ἕκαστον τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ καὶ συνετέλεσαν διαθήκην κατὰ πρόσωπόν μου ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ οὗ ἐπεκλήθη τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ
16 καὶ ἐπεστρέψατε καὶ ἐβεβηλώσατε τὸ ὄνομά μου τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι ἕκαστον τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕκαστον τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ οὓς ἐξαπεστείλατε ἐλευθέρους τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν ὑμῖν εἰς παῖδας καὶ παιδίσκας

17 διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως εἶπεν κύριος ὑμεῖς οὐκ ἠκούσατέ μου τοῦ καλέσαι ἄφεσιν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ καλῶ ἄφεσιν ὑμῖν εἰς μάχαιραν καὶ εἰς τὸν θάνατον καὶ εἰς τὸν λιμὸν καὶ δώσω ὑμᾶς εἰς διασπορὰν πάσαις ταῖς βασιλείαις τῆς γῆς
18 καὶ δώσω τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς παρεληλυθότας τὴν διαθήκην μου τοὺς μὴ στήσαντας τὴν διαθήκην μου ἣν ἐποίησαν κατὰ πρόσωπόν μου τὸν μόσχον ὃν ἐποίησαν ἐργάζεσθαι αὐτῷ
19 τοὺς ἄρχοντας Ιουδα καὶ τοὺς δυνάστας καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς καὶ τὸν λαόν
20 καὶ δώσω αὐτοὺς τοῖς ἐχθροῖς αὐτῶν καὶ ἔσται τὰ θνησιμαῖα αὐτῶν βρῶσις τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς
21 καὶ τὸν Σεδεκιαν βασιλέα τῆς Ιουδαίας καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας αὐτῶν δώσω εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν καὶ δύναμις βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος τοῖς ἀποτρέχουσιν ἀ{P'} αὐτῶν
22 ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ συντάσσω φησὶν κύριος καὶ ἐπιστρέψω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην καὶ πολεμήσουσιν ἐ{P'} αὐτὴν καὶ λήμψονται αὐτὴν καὶ κατακαύσουσιν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρὶ καὶ τὰς πόλεις Ιουδα καὶ δώσω αὐτὰς ἐρήμους ἀπὸ κατοικούντων
