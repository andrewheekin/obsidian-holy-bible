# Book of Nehemiah 4 (RSVCE)

### Hostile Plots Thwarted
1 Now when Sanbalʹlat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and greatly enraged, and he ridiculed the Jews.
2 And he said in the presence of his brethren and of the army of Samarʹia, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore things? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, and burned ones at that?”
3 Tobiʹah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, “Yes, what they are building—if a fox goes up on it he will break down their stone wall!”
4 Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn back their taunt upon their own heads, and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are captives.
5 Do not cover their guilt, and let not their sin be blotted out from thy sight; for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.
6 So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height. For the people had a mind to work.
7 But when Sanbalʹlat and Tobiʹah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashʹdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and that the breaches were beginning to be closed, they were very angry;
8 and they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.
9 And we prayed to our God, and set a guard as a protection against them day and night.
10 But Judah said, “The strength of the burden-bearers is failing, and there is much rubbish; we are not able to work on the wall.”
11 And our enemies said, “They will not know or see till we come into the midst of them and kill them and stop the work.”
12 When the Jews who lived by them came they said to us ten times, “From all the places where they live they will come up against us.”
13 So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in open places, I stationed the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
14 And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.”
15 When our enemies heard that it was known to us and that God had frustrated their plan, we all returned to the wall, each to his work.
16 From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail; and the leaders stood behind all the house of Judah,
17 who were building on the wall. Those who carried burdens were laden in such a way that each with one hand labored on the work and with the other held his weapon.
18 And each of the builders had his sword girded at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me.
19 And I said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and widely spread, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another.
20 In the place where you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”
21 So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn till the stars came out.
22 I also said to the people at that time, “Let every man and his servant pass the night within Jerusalem, that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day.”
23 So neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each kept his weapon in his hand.


# Liber Nehemiae Qui Et Esdrae Secundus Dicitur 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem, cum audisset Sanaballat quod ædificaremus murum, iratus est valde: et motus nimis subsannavit Judæos,
2 et dixit coram fratribus suis, et frequentia Samaritanorum: Quid Judæi faciunt imbecilles? num dimittent eos gentes? num sacrificabunt, et complebunt in una die? numquid ædificare poterunt lapides de acervis pulveris, qui combusti sunt?
3 Sed et Tobias Ammanites, proximus ejus, ait: Ædificent: si ascenderit vulpes, transiliet murum eorum lapideum.

4 Audi, Deus noster, quia facti sumus despectui: converte opprobrium super caput eorum, et da eos in despectionem in terra captivitatis.
5 Ne operias iniquitatem eorum, et peccatum eorum coram facie tua non deleatur, quia irriserunt ædificantes.

6 Itaque ædificavimus murum, et conjunximus totum usque ad partem dimidiam: et provocatum est cor populi ad operandum.
7 Factum est autem, cum audisset Sanaballat, et Tobias, et Arabes, et Ammanitæ, et Azotii, quod obducta esset cicatrix muri Jerusalem, et quod cœpissent interrupta concludi, irati sunt nimis.
8 Et congregati sunt omnes pariter ut venirent, et pugnarent contra Jerusalem, et molirentur insidias.
9 Et oravimus Deum nostrum, et posuimus custodes super murum die ac nocte contra eos.
10 Dixit autem Judas: Debilitata est fortitudo portantis, et humus nimia est, et nos non poterimus ædificare murum.
11 Et dixerunt hostes nostri: Nesciant, et ignorent donec veniamus in medium eorum, et interficiamus eos, et cessare faciamus opus.
12 Factum est autem venientibus Judæis qui habitabant juxta eos, et dicentibus nobis per decem vices, ex omnibus locis quibus venerant ad nos,
13 statui in loco post murum per circuitum populum in ordinem cum gladiis suis, et lanceis, et arcubus.
14 Et perspexi atque surrexi: et aio ad optimates et magistratus, et ad reliquam partem vulgi: Nolite timere a facie eorum: Domini magni et terribilis mementote, et pugnate pro fratribus vestris, filiis vestris, et filiabus vestris, et uxoribus vestris, et domibus vestris.
15 Factum est autem, cum audissent inimici nostri nuntiatum esse nobis, dissipavit Deus consilium eorum. Et reversi sumus omnes ad muros, unusquisque ad opus suum.
16 Et factum est a die illa, media pars juvenum eorum faciebat opus, et media parata erat ad bellum: et lanceæ, et scuta, et arcus, et loricæ, et principes post eos in omni domo Juda.
17 Ædificantium in muro, et portantium onera, et imponentium: una manu sua faciebat opus, et altera tenebat gladium:
18 ædificentium enim unusquisque gladio erat accinctus renes. Et ædificabant, et clangebant buccina juxta me.
19 Et dixi ad optimates, et ad magistratus, et ad reliquam partem vulgi: Opus grande est et latum, et nos separati sumus in muro procul alter ab altero:
20 in loco quocumque audieritis clangorem tubæ, illuc concurrite ad nos: Deus noster pugnabit pro nobis.
21 Et nos ipsi faciamus opus, et media pars nostrum teneat lanceas ab ascensu auroræ donec egrediantur astra.
22 In tempore quoque illo dixi populo: Unusquisque cum puero suo maneat in medio Jerusalem, et sint nobis vices per noctem et diem ad operandum.
23 Ego autem et fratres mei, et pueri mei, et custodes, qui erant post me, non deponebamus vestimenta nostra: unusquisque tantum nudabatur ad baptismum.


# Ἔσδρας Βʹ 4 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἤκουσεν Σαναβαλλατ ὅτι ἡμεῖς οἰκοδομοῦμεν τὸ τεῖχος καὶ πονηρὸν ἦν αὐτῷ καὶ ὠργίσθη ἐπὶ πολὺ καὶ ἐξεγέλα ἐπὶ τοῖς Ιουδαίοις
2 καὶ εἶπεν ἐνώπιον τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ αὕτη ἡ δύναμις Σομορων ὅτι οἱ Ιουδαῖοι οὗτοι οἰκοδομοῦσιν τὴν ἑαυτῶν πόλιν
3 καὶ Τωβιας ὁ αμμανίτης ἐχόμενα αὐτοῦ ἦλθεν καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς ἑαυτούς μὴ θυσιάσουσιν ἢ φάγονται ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν οὐχὶ ἀναβήσεται ἀλώπηξ καὶ καθελεῖ τὸ τεῖχος λίθων αὐτῶν

4 ἄκουσον ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν ὅτι ἐγενήθημεν εἰς μυκτηρισμόν καὶ ἐπίστρεψον ὀνειδισμὸν αὐτῶν εἰς κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν καὶ δὸς αὐτοὺς εἰς μυκτηρισμὸν ἐν γῇ αἰχμαλωσίας
5 καὶ μὴ καλύψῃς ἐπὶ ἀνομίαν

6 
7 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Σαναβαλλατ καὶ Τωβια καὶ οἱ Ἄραβες καὶ οἱ Αμμανῖται ὅτι ἀνέβη φυὴ τοῖς τείχεσιν Ιερουσαλημ ὅτι ἤρξαντο αἱ διασφαγαὶ ἀναφράσσεσθαι καὶ πονηρὸν αὐτοῖς ἐφάνη σφόδρα
8 καὶ συνήχθησαν πάντες ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἐλθεῖν παρατάξασθαι ἐν Ιερουσαλημ
9 καὶ προσηυξάμεθα πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ἡμῶν καὶ ἐστήσαμεν προφύλακας ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν
10 καὶ εἶπεν Ιουδας συνετρίβη ἡ ἰσχὺς τῶν ἐχθρῶν καὶ ὁ χοῦς πολύς καὶ ἡμεῖς οὐ δυνησόμεθα οἰκοδομεῖν ἐν τῷ τείχει
11 καὶ εἶπαν οἱ θλίβοντες ἡμᾶς οὐ γνώσονται καὶ οὐκ ὄψονται ἕως ὅτου ἔλθωμεν εἰς μέσον αὐτῶν καὶ φονεύσωμεν αὐτοὺς καὶ καταπαύσωμεν τὸ ἔργον
12 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤλθοσαν οἱ Ιουδαῖοι οἱ οἰκοῦντες ἐχόμενα αὐτῶν καὶ εἴποσαν ἡμῖν ἀναβαίνουσιν ἐκ πάντων τῶν τόπων ἐ{F'} ἡμᾶς
13 καὶ ἔστησα εἰς τὰ κατώτατα τοῦ τόπου κατόπισθεν τοῦ τείχους ἐν τοῖς σκεπεινοῖς καὶ ἔστησα τὸν λαὸν κατὰ δήμους μετὰ ῥομφαιῶν αὐτῶν λόγχας αὐτῶν καὶ τόξα αὐτῶν
14 καὶ εἶδον καὶ ἀνέστην καὶ εἶπα πρὸς τοὺς ἐντίμους καὶ πρὸς τοὺς στρατηγοὺς καὶ πρὸς τοὺς καταλοίπους τοῦ λαοῦ μὴ φοβηθῆτε ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν μνήσθητε τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν τοῦ μεγάλου καὶ φοβεροῦ καὶ παρατάξασθε περὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν υἱῶν ὑμῶν καὶ θυγατέρων ὑμῶν γυναικῶν ὑμῶν καὶ οἴκων ὑμῶν
15 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἤκουσαν οἱ ἐχθροὶ ἡμῶν ὅτι ἐγνώσθη ἡμῖν καὶ διεσκέδασεν ὁ θεὸς τὴν βουλὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπεστρέψαμεν πάντες ἡμεῖς εἰς τὸ τεῖχος ἀνὴρ εἰς τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ
16 καὶ ἐγένετο ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης ἥμισυ τῶν ἐκτετιναγμένων ἐποίουν τὸ ἔργον καὶ ἥμισυ αὐτῶν ἀντείχοντο καὶ λόγχαι καὶ θυρεοὶ καὶ τὰ τόξα καὶ οἱ θώρακες καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ὀπίσω παντὸς οἴκου Ιουδα
17 τῶν οἰκοδομούντων ἐν τῷ τείχει καὶ οἱ αἴροντες ἐν τοῖς ἀρτῆρσιν ἐν ὅπλοις ἐν μιᾷ χειρὶ ἐποίει αὐτὸ τὸ ἔργον καὶ μία ἐκράτει τὴν βολίδα
18 καὶ οἱ οἰκοδόμοι ἀνὴρ ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ ἐζωσμένος ἐπὶ τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ καὶ ᾠκοδομοῦσαν καὶ ὁ σαλπίζων ἐν τῇ κερατίνῃ ἐχόμενα αὐτοῦ
19 καὶ εἶπα πρὸς τοὺς ἐντίμους καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ πρὸς τοὺς καταλοίπους τοῦ λαοῦ τὸ ἔργον πλατὺ καὶ πολύ καὶ ἡμεῖς σκορπιζόμεθα ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους μακρὰν ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ
20 ἐν τόπῳ οὗ ἐὰν ἀκούσητε τὴν φωνὴν τῆς κερατίνης ἐκεῖ συναχθήσεσθε πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν πολεμήσει περὶ ἡμῶν
21 καὶ ἡμεῖς ποιοῦντες τὸ ἔργον καὶ ἥμισυ αὐτῶν κρατοῦντες τὰς λόγχας ἀπὸ ἀναβάσεως τοῦ ὄρθρου ἕως ἐξόδου τῶν ἄστρων
22 καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ εἶπα τῷ λαῷ αὐλίσθητε ἐν μέσῳ Ιερουσαλημ καὶ ἔστω ὑμῖν ἡ νὺξ προφυλακὴ καὶ ἡ ἡμέρα ἔργον
23 καὶ ἤμην ἐγὼ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς προφυλακῆς ὀπίσω μου καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐξ ἡμῶν ἐκδιδυσκόμενος ἀνὴρ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ
