# Book of Nehemiah 6 (RSVCE)

### Intrigues of Enemies Foiled
1 Now when it was reported to Sanbalʹlat and Tobiʹah and to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it (although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),
2 Sanbalʹlat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come and let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to do me harm.
3 And I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”
4 And they sent to me four times in this way and I answered them in the same manner.
5 In the same way Sanbalʹlat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.
6 In it was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Geshem also says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you are building the wall; and you wish to become their king, according to this report.
7 And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, ‘There is a king in Judah.’ And now it will be reported to the king according to these words. So now come, and let us take counsel together.”
8 Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say have been done, for you are inventing them out of your own mind.”
9 For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done.” But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.
10 Now when I went into the house of Shemaiʹah the son of Delaiʹah, son of Mehetʹabel, who was shut up, he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill you, at night they are coming to kill you.”
11 But I said, “Should such a man as I flee? And what man such as I could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.”
12 And I understood, and saw that God had not sent him, but he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobiʹah and Sanbalʹlat had hired him.
13 For this purpose he was hired, that I should be afraid and act in this way and sin, and so they could give me an evil name, in order to taunt me.
14 Remember Tobiʹah and Sanbalʹlat, O my God, according to these things that they did, and also the prophetess No-adiʹah and the rest of the prophets who wanted to make me afraid.
### The Wall Completed
15 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.
16 And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations round about us were afraid and fell greatly in their own esteem; for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.
17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiʹah, and Tobiʹah’s letters came to them.
18 For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniʹah the son of Arah: and his son Jeho-haʹnan had taken the daughter of Meshulʹlam the son of Berechiʹah as his wife.
19 Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence, and reported my words to him. And Tobiʹah sent letters to make me afraid.


# Liber Nehemiae Qui Et Esdrae Secundus Dicitur 6 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem, cum audisset Sanaballat, et Tobias, et Gossem Arabs, et ceteri inimici nostri, quod ædificassem ego murum, et non esset in ipso residua interruptio (usque ad tempus autem illud valvas non posueram in portis),
2 miserunt Sanaballat et Gossem ad me, dicentes: Veni, et percutiamus fœdus pariter in viculis in campo Ono. Ipsi autem cogitabant ut facerent mihi malum.
3 Misi ergo ad eos nuntios, dicens: Opus grande ego facio, et non possum descendere, ne forte negligatur cum venero, et descendero ad vos.
4 Miserunt autem ad me secundum verbum hoc per quatuor vices: et respondi eis juxta sermonem priorem.
5 Et misit ad me Sanaballat juxta verbum prius quinta vice puerum suum, et epistolam habebat in manu sua scriptam hoc modo:
6 In gentibus auditum est, et Gossem dixit, quod tu et Judæi cogitetis rebellare, et propterea ædifices murum, et levare te velis super eos regem: propter quam causam
7 et prophetas posueris, qui prædicent de te in Jerusalem, dicentes: Rex in Judæa est. Auditurus est rex verba hæc: idcirco nunc veni, ut ineamus consilium pariter.
8 Et misi ad eos, dicens: Non est factum secundum verba hæc, quæ tu loqueris: de corde enim tuo tu componis hæc.

9 Omnes enim hi terrebant nos, cogitantes quod cessarent manus nostræ ab opere, et quiesceremus: quam ob causam magis confortavi manus meas.
10 Et ingressus sum domum Semaiæ filii Dalaiæ filii Metabeel secreto. Qui ait: Tractemus nobiscum in domo Dei in medio templi, et claudamus portas ædis: quia venturi sunt ut interficiant te, et nocte venturi sunt ad occidendum te.
11 Et dixi: Num quisquam similis mei fugit? et quis ut ego ingredietur templum, et vivet? non ingrediar.
12 Et intellexi quod Deus non misisset eum, sed quasi vaticinans locutus esset ad me, et Tobias et Sanaballat conduxissent eum.
13 Acceperat enim pretium, ut territus facerem, et peccarem, et haberent malum quod exprobrarent mihi.
14 Memento mei, Domine, pro Tobia et Sanaballat, juxta opera eorum talia: sed et Noadiæ prophetæ, et ceterorum prophetarum, qui terrebant me.

15 Completus est autem murus vigesimo quinto die mensis Elul, quinquaginta duobus diebus.
16 Factum est ergo cum audissent omnes inimici nostri, ut timerent universæ gentes quæ erant in circuitu nostro, et conciderent intra semetipsos, et scirent quod a Deo factum esset opus hoc.

17 Sed et in diebus illis multæ optimatum Judæorum epistolæ mittebantur ad Tobiam, et a Tobia veniebant ad eos.
18 Multi enim erant in Judæa habentes juramentum ejus, quia gener erat Secheniæ filii Area, et Johanan filius ejus acceperat filiam Mosollam filii Barachiæ:
19 sed et laudabant eum coram me, et verba mea nuntiabant ei: et Tobias mittebat epistolas ut terreret me.


# Ἔσδρας Βʹ 6 (Septuagint)

1 καὶ ἐγένετο καθὼς ἠκούσθη τῷ Σαναβαλλατ καὶ Τωβια καὶ τῷ Γησαμ τῷ Αραβι καὶ τοῖς καταλοίποις τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν ὅτι ᾠκοδόμησα τὸ τεῖχος καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη ἐν αὐτοῖς πνοή ἕως τοῦ καιροῦ ἐκείνου θύρας οὐκ ἐπέστησα ἐν ταῖς πύλαις
2 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σαναβαλλατ καὶ Γησαμ πρός με λέγων δεῦρο καὶ συναχθῶμεν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἐν ταῖς κώμαις ἐν πεδίῳ Ωνω καὶ αὐτοὶ λογιζόμενοι ποιῆσαί μοι πονηρίαν
3 καὶ ἀπέστειλα ἐ{P'} αὐτοὺς ἀγγέλους λέγων ἔργον μέγα ἐγὼ ποιῶ καὶ οὐ δυνήσομαι καταβῆναι μήποτε καταπαύσῃ τὸ ἔργον ὡς ἂν τελειώσω αὐτό καταβήσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς
4 καὶ ἀπέστειλαν πρός με ὡς τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο καὶ ἀπέστειλα αὐτοῖς κατὰ ταῦτα
5 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν πρός με Σαναβαλλατ τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπιστολὴν ἀνεῳγμένην ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ
6 καὶ ἦν γεγραμμένον ἐν αὐτῇ ἐν ἔθνεσιν ἠκούσθη ὅτι σὺ καὶ οἱ Ιουδαῖοι λογίζεσθε ἀποστατῆσαι διὰ τοῦτο σὺ οἰκοδομεῖς τὸ τεῖχος καὶ σὺ γίνῃ αὐτοῖς εἰς βασιλέα
7 καὶ πρὸς τούτοις προφήτας ἔστησας σεαυτῷ ἵνα καθίσῃς ἐν Ιερουσαλημ εἰς βασιλέα ἐν Ιουδα καὶ νῦν ἀπαγγελήσονται τῷ βασιλεῖ οἱ λόγοι οὗτοι καὶ νῦν δεῦρο βουλευσώμεθα ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό
8 καὶ ἀπέστειλα πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγων οὐκ ἐγενήθη ὡς οἱ λόγοι οὗτοι οὓς σὺ λέγεις ὅτι ἀπὸ καρδίας σου σὺ ψεύδῃ αὐτούς

9 ὅτι πάντες φοβερίζουσιν ἡμᾶς λέγοντες ἐκλυθήσονται αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἔργου τούτου καὶ οὐ ποιηθήσεται καὶ νῦν ἐκραταίωσα τὰς χεῖράς μου
10 καὶ ἐγὼ εἰσῆλθον εἰς οἶκον Σεμεϊ υἱοῦ Δαλαια υἱοῦ Μεηταβηλ καὶ αὐτὸς συνεχόμενος καὶ εἶπεν συναχθῶμεν εἰς οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ κλείσωμεν τὰς θύρας αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἔρχονται νυκτὸς φονεῦσαί σε
11 καὶ εἶπα τίς ἐστιν ὁ ἀνήρ ὃς εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὸν οἶκον καὶ ζήσεται
12 καὶ ἐπέγνων καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ θεὸς οὐκ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτόν ὅτι ἡ προφητεία λόγος κα{T'} ἐμοῦ καὶ Τωβιας καὶ Σαναβαλλατ ἐμισθώσαντο
13 ἐ{P'} ἐμὲ ὄχλον ὅπως φοβηθῶ καὶ ποιήσω οὕτως καὶ ἁμάρτω καὶ γένωμαι αὐτοῖς εἰς ὄνομα πονηρόν ὅπως ὀνειδίσωσίν με
14 μνήσθητι ὁ θεός τῷ Τωβια καὶ τῷ Σαναβαλλατ ὡς τὰ ποιήματα αὐτοῦ ταῦτα καὶ τῷ Νωαδια τῷ προφήτῃ καὶ τοῖς καταλοίποις τῶν προφητῶν οἳ ἦσαν φοβερίζοντές με

15 καὶ ἐτελέσθη τὸ τεῖχος πέμπτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ Ελουλ εἰς πεντήκοντα καὶ δύο ἡμέρας
16 καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἤκουσαν πάντες οἱ ἐχθροὶ ἡμῶν καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ ἡμῶν καὶ ἐπέπεσεν φόβος σφόδρα ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν καὶ ἔγνωσαν ὅτι παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐγενήθη τελειωθῆναι τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο

17 καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἀπὸ πολλῶν ἐντίμων Ιουδα ἐπιστολαὶ ἐπορεύοντο πρὸς Τωβιαν καὶ αἱ Τωβια ἤρχοντο πρὸς αὐτούς
18 ὅτι πολλοὶ ἐν Ιουδα ἔνορκοι ἦσαν αὐτῷ ὅτι γαμβρὸς ἦν τοῦ Σεχενια υἱοῦ Ηραε καὶ Ιωαναν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἔλαβεν τὴν θυγατέρα Μεσουλαμ υἱοῦ Βαραχια εἰς γυναῖκα
19 καὶ τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ ἦσαν λέγοντες πρός με καὶ λόγους μου ἦσαν ἐκφέροντες αὐτῷ καὶ ἐπιστολὰς ἀπέστειλεν Τωβιας φοβερίσαι με
