# Book of Leviticus 20 (RSVCE)

### Penalties for Violations of Holiness
1 TheLordsaid to Moses,
2 “Say to the people of Israel, Any man of the people of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who gives any of his children to Molech shall be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
3 I myself will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given one of his children to Molech, defiling my sanctuary and profaning my holy name.
4 And if the people of the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he gives one of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death,
5 then I will set my face against that man and against his family, and will cut them off from among their people, him and all who follow him in playing the harlot after Molech.
6 “If a person turns to mediums and wizards, playing the harlot after them, I will set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people.
7 Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am theLordyour God.
8 Keep my statutes, and do them; I am theLordwho sanctify you.
9 For every one who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother, his blood is upon him.
10 “If a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death.
11 The man who lies with his father’s wife has uncovered his father’s nakedness; both of them shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.
12 If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be put to death; they have committed incest, their blood is upon them.
13 If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.
14 If a man takes a wife and her mother also, it is wickedness; they shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there may be no wickedness among you.
15 If a man lies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast.
16 If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.
17 “If a man takes his sister, a daughter of his father or a daughter of his mother, and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a shameful thing, and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people; he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness, he shall bear his iniquity.
18 If a man lies with a woman having her sickness, and uncovers her nakedness, he has made naked her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood; both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
19 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister or of your father’s sister, for that is to make naked one’s near kin; they shall bear their iniquity.
20 If a man lies with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness; they shall bear their sin, they shall die childless.
21 If a man takes his brother’s wife, it is impurity; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness, they shall be childless.
22 “You shall therefore keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and do them; that the land where I am bringing you to dwell may not vomit you out.
23 And you shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I am casting out before you; for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
24 But I have said to you, ‘You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey.’ I am theLordyour God, who have separated you from the peoples.
25 You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; you shall not make yourselves abominable by beast or by bird or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have set apart for you to hold unclean.
26 You shall be holy to me; for I theLordam holy, and have separated you from the peoples, that you should be mine.
27 “A man or a woman who is a medium or a wizard shall be put to death; they shall be stoned with stones, their blood shall be upon them.”


# Liber Leviticus 20 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen, dicens:
2 Hæc loqueris filiis Israël: Homo de filiis Israël, et de advenis qui habitant in Israël, si quis dederit de semine suo idolo Moloch, morte moriatur: populus terræ lapidabit eum.
3 Et ego ponam faciem meam contra illum: succidamque eum de medio populi sui, eo quod dederit de semine suo Moloch, et contaminaverit sanctuarium meum, ac polluerit nomen sanctum meum.
4 Quod si negligens populus terræ, et quasi parvipendens imperium meum, dimiserit hominem qui dedit de semine suo Moloch, nec voluerit eum occidere:
5 ponam faciem meam super hominem illum, et super cognationem ejus, succidamque et ipsum, et omnes qui consenserunt ei ut fornicarentur cum Moloch, de medio populi sui.
6 Anima, quæ declinaverit ad magos et ariolos, et fornicata fuerit cum eis, ponam faciem meam contra eam, et interficiam illam de medio populi sui.
7 Sanctificamini et estote sancti, quia ego sum Dominus Deus vester.
8 Custodite præcepta mea, et facite ea: ego Dominus qui sanctifico vos.

9 Qui maledixerit patri suo, aut matri, morte moriatur: patri matrique maledixit: sanguis ejus sit super eum.

10 Si mœchatus quis fuerit cum uxore alterius, et adulterium perpetraverit cum conjuge proximi sui, morte moriantur et mœchus et adultera.
11 Qui dormierit cum noverca sua, et revelaverit ignominiam patris sui, morte moriantur ambo: sanguis eorum sit super eos.
12 Si quis dormierit cum nuru sua, uterque moriatur, quia scelus operati sunt: sanguis eorum sit super eos.
13 Qui dormierit cum masculo coitu femineo, uterque operatus est nefas: morte moriantur: sit sanguis eorum super eos.
14 Qui supra uxorem filiam, duxerit matrem ejus, scelus operatus est: vivus ardebit cum eis, nec permanebit tantum nefas in medio vestri.
15 Qui cum jumento et pecore coierit, morte moriatur: pecus quoque occidite.
16 Mulier, quæ succubuerit cuilibet jumento, simul interficietur cum eo: sanguis eorum sit super eos.
17 Qui acceperit sororem suam filiam patris sui, vel filiam matris suæ, et viderit turpitudinem ejus, illaque conspexerit fratris ignominiam, nefariam rem operati sunt: occidentur in conspectu populi sui, eo quod turpitudinem suam mutuo revelaverint, et portabunt iniquitatem suam.
18 Qui coierit cum muliere in fluxu menstruo, et revelaverit turpitudinem ejus, ipsaque aperuerit fontem sanguinis sui, interficientur ambo de medio populi sui.

19 Turpitudinem materteræ et amitæ tuæ non discooperies: qui hoc fecerit, ignominiam carnis suæ nudavit; portabunt ambo iniquitatem suam.
20 Qui coierit cum uxore patrui vel avunculi sui, et revelaverit ignominiam cognationis suæ, portabunt ambo peccatum suum: absque liberis morientur.
21 Qui duxerit uxorem fratris sui, rem facit illicitam: turpitudinem fratris sui revelavit: absque liberis erunt.

22 Custodite leges meas, atque judicia, et facite ea: ne et vos evomat terra quam intraturi estis et habitaturi.
23 Nolite ambulare in legitimis nationum, quas ego expulsurus sum ante vos. Omnia enim hæc fecerunt, et abominatus sum eas.
24 Vobis autem loquor. Possidete terram eorum, quam dabo vobis in hæreditatem, terram fluentem lacte et melle. Ego Dominus Deus vester, qui separavi vos a ceteris populis.
25 Separate ergo et vos jumentum mundum ab immundo, et avem mundam ab immunda: ne polluatis animas vestras in pecore, et avibus, et cunctis quæ moventur in terra, et quæ vobis ostendi esse polluta.
26 Eritis mihi sancti, quia sanctus sum ego Dominus, et separavi vos a ceteris populis, ut essetis mei.

27 Vir, sive mulier, in quibus pythonicus, vel divinationis fuerit spiritus, morte moriantur: lapidibus obruent eos: sanguis eorum sit super illos.

1 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων
2 καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ισραηλ λαλήσεις ἐάν τις ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ισραηλ ἢ ἀπὸ τῶν προσγεγενημένων προσηλύτων ἐν Ισραηλ ὃς ἂν δῷ τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ ἄρχοντι θανάτῳ θανατούσθω τὸ ἔθνος τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς λιθοβολήσουσιν αὐτὸν ἐν λίθοις
3 καὶ ἐγὼ ἐπιστήσω τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐκεῖνον καὶ ἀπολῶ αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ ὅτι τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ ἔδωκεν ἄρχοντι ἵνα μιάνῃ τὰ ἅγιά μου καὶ βεβηλώσῃ τὸ ὄνομα τῶν ἡγιασμένων μοι
4 ἐὰν δὲ ὑπερόψει ὑπερίδωσιν οἱ αὐτόχθονες τῆς γῆς τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐκείνου ἐν τῷ δοῦναι αὐτὸν τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ ἄρχοντι τοῦ μὴ ἀποκτεῖναι αὐτόν
5 καὶ ἐπιστήσω τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐκεῖνον καὶ τὴν συγγένειαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπολῶ αὐτὸν καὶ πάντας τοὺς ὁμονοοῦντας αὐτῷ ὥστε ἐκπορνεύειν αὐτὸν εἰς τοὺς ἄρχοντας ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῶν
6 καὶ ψυχή ἣ ἐὰν ἐπακολουθήσῃ ἐγγαστριμύθοις ἢ ἐπαοιδοῖς ὥστε ἐκπορνεῦσαι ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἐπιστήσω τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἐκείνην καὶ ἀπολῶ αὐτὴν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς
7 καὶ ἔσεσθε ἅγιοι ὅτι ἅγιος ἐγὼ κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν

14 ὃς ἐὰν λάβῃ γυναῖκα καὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτῆς ἀνόμημά ἐστιν ἐν πυρὶ κατακαύσουσιν αὐτὸν καὶ αὐτάς καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἀνομία ἐν ὑμῖν
15 καὶ ὃς ἂν δῷ κοιτασίαν αὐτοῦ ἐν τετράποδι θανάτῳ θανατούσθω καὶ τὸ τετράπουν ἀποκτενεῖτε
16 καὶ γυνή ἥτις προσελεύσεται πρὸς πᾶν κτῆνος βιβασθῆναι αὐτὴν ὑ{P'} αὐτοῦ ἀποκτενεῖτε τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τὸ κτῆνος θανάτῳ θανατούσθωσαν ἔνοχοί εἰσιν
17 ὃς ἐὰν λάβῃ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἢ ἐκ μητρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἴδῃ τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτῆς καὶ αὕτη ἴδῃ τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτοῦ ὄνειδός ἐστιν ἐξολεθρευθήσονται ἐνώπιον υἱῶν γένους αὐτῶν ἀσχημοσύνην ἀδελφῆς αὐτοῦ ἀπεκάλυψεν ἁμαρτίαν κομιοῦνται
18 καὶ ἀνήρ ὃς ἂν κοιμηθῇ μετὰ γυναικὸς ἀποκαθημένης καὶ ἀποκαλύψῃ τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτῆς τὴν πηγὴν αὐτῆς ἀπεκάλυψεν καὶ αὕτη ἀπεκάλυψεν τὴν ῥύσιν τοῦ αἵματος αὐτῆς ἐξολεθρευθήσονται ἀμφότεροι ἐκ τοῦ γένους αὐτῶν

19 καὶ ἀσχημοσύνην ἀδελφῆς πατρός σου καὶ ἀδελφῆς μητρός σου οὐκ ἀποκαλύψεις τὴν γὰρ οἰκειότητα ἀπεκάλυψεν ἁμαρτίαν ἀποίσονται
20 ὃς ἂν κοιμηθῇ μετὰ τῆς συγγενοῦς αὐτοῦ ἀσχημοσύνην τῆς συγγενείας αὐτοῦ ἀπεκάλυψεν ἄτεκνοι ἀποθανοῦνται

22 καὶ φυλάξασθε πάντα τὰ προστάγματά μου καὶ τὰ κρίματά μου καὶ ποιήσετε αὐτά καὶ οὐ μὴ προσοχθίσῃ ὑμῖν ἡ γῆ εἰς ἣν ἐγὼ εἰσάγω ὑμᾶς ἐκεῖ κατοικεῖν ἐ{P'} αὐτῆς

26 καὶ ἔσεσθέ μοι ἅγιοι ὅτι ἐγὼ ἅγιος κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν ὁ ἀφορίσας ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν εἶναι ἐμοί

27 καὶ ἀνὴρ ἢ γυνή ὃς ἂν γένηται αὐτῶν ἐγγαστρίμυθος ἢ ἐπαοιδός θανάτῳ θανατούσθωσαν ἀμφότεροι λίθοις λιθοβολήσατε αὐτούς ἔνοχοί εἰσιν
