# Book of Leviticus 8 (RSVCE)

### The Rites of Ordination
1 TheLordsaid to the Moses,
2 “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;
3 and assemble all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.”
4 And Moses did as theLordcommanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.
5 And Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing which theLordhas commanded to be done.”
6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
7 And he put on him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, binding it to him therewith.
8 And he placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.
9 And he set the turban upon his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown, as theLordcommanded Moses.
10 Then Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.
11 And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the laver and its base, to consecrate them.
12 And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to consecrate him.
13 And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound caps on them, as theLordcommanded Moses.
14 Then he brought the bull of the sin offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bull of the sin offering.
15 And Moses killed it, and took the blood, and with his finger put it on the horns of the altar round about, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and consecrated it, to make atonement for it.
16 And he took all the fat that was on the entrails, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.
17 But the bull, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as theLordcommanded Moses.
18 Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
19 And Moses killed it, and threw the blood upon the altar round about.
20 And when the ram was cut into pieces, Moses burned the head and the pieces and the fat.
21 And when the entrails and the legs were washed with water, Moses burned the whole ram on the altar, as a burnt offering, a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to theLord, as theLordcommanded Moses.
22 Then he presented the other ram, the ram of ordination; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
23 And Moses killed it, and took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot.
24 And Aaron’s sons were brought, and Moses put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the great toes of their right feet; and Moses threw the blood upon the altar round about.
25 Then he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and the right thigh;
26 and out of the basket of unleavened bread which was before theLordhe took one unleavened cake, and one cake of bread with oil, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat and on the right thigh;
27 and he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and waved them as a wave offering before theLord.
28 Then Moses took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering, as an ordination offering, a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to theLord.
29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before theLord; it was Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination, as theLordcommanded Moses.
30 Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron and his garments, and also upon his sons and his sons’ garments; so he consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.
31 And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it’;
32 and what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn with fire.
33 And you shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for it will take seven days to ordain you.
34 As has been done today, theLordhas commanded to be done to make atonement for you.
35 At the door of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days, performing what theLordhas charged, lest you die; for so I am commanded.”
36 And Aaron and his sons did all the things which theLordcommanded by Moses.


# Liber Leviticus 8 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen, dicens:
2 Tolle Aaron cum filiis suis, vestes eorum, et unctionis oleum, vitulum pro peccato, duos arietes, canistrum cum azymis:
3 et congregabis omnem cœtum ad ostium tabernaculi.
4 Fecit Moyses ut Dominus imperaverat. Congregataque omni turba ante fores tabernaculi,
5 ait: Iste est sermo, quem jussit Dominus fieri.

6 Statimque obtulit Aaron et filios ejus. Cumque lavisset eos,
7 vestivit pontificem subucula linea, accingens eum balteo, et induens eum tunica hyacinthina, et desuper humerale imposuit,
8 quod astringens cingulo aptavit rationali, in quo erat Doctrina et Veritas.
9 Cidari quoque texit caput: et super eam, contra frontem, posuit laminam auream consecratam in sanctificatione, sicut præceperat ei Dominus.
10 Tulit et unctionis oleum, quo linivit tabernaculum cum omni supellectili sua.
11 Cumque sanctificans aspersisset altare septem vicibus, unxit illud, et omnia vasa ejus, labrumque cum basi sua sanctificavit oleo.
12 Quod fundens super caput Aaron, unxit eum, et consecravit:
13 filios quoque ejus oblatos vestivit tunicis lineis, et cinxit balteis, imposuitque mitras, ut jusserat Dominus.

14 Obtulit et vitulum pro peccato: cumque super caput ejus posuisset Aaron et filii ejus manus suas,
15 immolavit eum, hauriens sanguinem, et tincto digito, tetigit cornua altaris per gyrum: quo expiato et sanctificato, fudit reliquum sanguinem ad fundamenta ejus.
16 Adipem vero qui erat super vitalia, et reticulum jecoris, duosque renunculos, cum arvinulis suis, adolevit super altare:
17 vitulum cum pelle, et carnibus, et fimo, cremans extra castra, sicut præceperat Dominus.

18 Obtulit et arietem in holocaustum: super cujus caput cum imposuissent Aaron et filii ejus manus suas,
19 immolavit eum, et fudit sanguinem ejus per circuitum altaris.
20 Ipsumque arietem in frusta concidens, caput ejus, et artus, et adipem adolevit igni,
21 lotis prius intestinis et pedibus: totumque simul arietem incendit super altare, eo quod esset holocaustum suavissimi odoris Domino, sicut præceperat ei.

22 Obtulit et arietem secundum in consecratione sacerdotum, posueruntque super caput ejus Aaron et filii ejus manus suas:
23 quem cum immolasset Moyses, sumens de sanguine ejus, tetigit extremum auriculæ dextræ Aaron, et pollicem manus ejus dextræ, similiter et pedis.
24 Obtulit et filios Aaron: cumque de sanguine arietis immolati tetigisset extremum auriculæ singulorum dextræ, et pollices manus ac pedis dextri, reliquum fudit super altare per circuitum:
25 adipem vero, et caudam, omnemque pinguedinem quæ operit intestina, reticulumque jecoris, et duos renes cum adipibus suis et armo dextro separavit.
26 Tollens autem de canistro azymorum, quod erat coram Domino, panem absque fermento, et collyridam conspersam oleo, laganumque, posuit super adipes, et armum dextrum,
27 tradens simul omnia Aaron et filiis ejus. Qui postquam levaverunt ea coram Domino,
28 rursum suscepta de manibus eorum, adolevit super altare holocausti, eo quod consecrationis esset oblatio, in odorem suavitatis, sacrificii Domino.
29 Tulitque pectusculum, elevans illud coram Domino, de ariete consecrationis in partem suam, sicut præceperat ei Dominus.

30 Assumensque unguentum, et sanguinem qui erat in altari, aspersit super Aaron et vestimenta ejus, et super filios illius ac vestes eorum.
31 Cumque sanctificasset eos in vestitu suo, præcepit eis, dicens: Coquite carnes ante fores tabernaculi, et ibi comedite eas; panes quoque consecrationis edite, qui positi sunt in canistro, sicut præcepit mihi Dominus, dicens: Aaron et filii ejus comedent eos:
32 quidquid autem reliquum fuerit de carne et panibus, ignis absumet.
33 De ostio quoque tabernaculi non exibitis septem diebus, usque ad diem quo complebitur tempus consecrationis vestræ; septem enim diebus finitur consecratio:
34 sicut et impræsentiarum factum est, ut ritus sacrificii compleretur.
35 Die ac nocte manebitis in tabernaculo observantes custodias Domini, ne moriamini: sic enim mihi præceptum est.

36 Feceruntque Aaron et filii ejus cuncta quæ locutus est Dominus per manum Moysi.

1 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων
2 λαβὲ Ααρων καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς στολὰς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον τῆς χρίσεως καὶ τὸν μόσχον τὸν περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας καὶ τοὺς δύο κριοὺς καὶ τὸ κανοῦν τῶν ἀζύμων

17 καὶ τὸν μόσχον καὶ τὴν βύρσαν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ κρέα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν κόπρον αὐτοῦ καὶ κατέκαυσεν αὐτὰ πυρὶ ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς ὃν τρόπον συνέταξεν κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ

34 καθάπερ ἐποίησεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ ἐνετείλατο κύριος τοῦ ποιῆσαι ὥστε ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ ὑμῶν
35 καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου καθήσεσθε ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἡμέραν καὶ νύκτα φυλάξεσθε τὰ φυλάγματα κυρίου ἵνα μὴ ἀποθάνητε οὕτως γὰρ ἐνετείλατό μοι κύριος ὁ θεός

36 καὶ ἐποίησεν Ααρων καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ πάντας τοὺς λόγους οὓς συνέταξεν κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ
