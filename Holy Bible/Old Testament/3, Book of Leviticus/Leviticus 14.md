# Book of Leviticus 14 (RSVCE)

### Purification of Lepers and Leprous Houses
1 TheLordsaid to Moses,
2 “This shall be the law of the leper for the day of his cleansing. He shall be brought to the priest;
3 and the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall make an examination. Then, if the leprous disease is healed in the leper,
4 the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds and cedarwood and scarlet stuff and hyssop;
5 and the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.
6 He shall take the living bird with the cedarwood and the scarlet stuff and the hyssop, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water;
7 and he shall sprinkle it seven times upon him who is to be cleansed of leprosy; then he shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird go into the open field.
8 And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean; and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days.
9 And on the seventh day he shall shave all his hair off his head; he shall shave off his beard and his eyebrows, all his hair. Then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.
10 “And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and a cereal offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, and one log of oil.
11 And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed and these things before theLord, at the door of the tent of meeting.
12 And the priest shall take one of the male lambs, and offer it for a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before theLord;
13 and he shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place; for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
14 The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.
15 Then the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand,
16 and dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and sprinkle some oil with his finger seven times before theLord.
17 And some of the oil that remains in his hand the priest shall put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the guilt offering;
18 and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make atonement for him before theLord.
19 The priest shall offer the sin offering, to make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he shall kill the burnt offering;
20 and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the cereal offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
21 “But if he is poor and cannot afford so much, then he shall take one male lamb for a guilt offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a cereal offering, and a log of oil;
22 also two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he can afford; the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
23 And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting, before theLord;
24 and the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before theLord.
25 And he shall kill the lamb of the guilt offering; and the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.
26 And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand;
27 and shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before theLord;
28 and the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, in the place where the blood of the guilt offering was put;
29 and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before theLord.
30 And he shall offer, of the turtledoves or young pigeons such as he can afford,
31 one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, along with a cereal offering; and the priest shall make atonement before theLordfor him who is being cleansed.
32 This is the law for him in whom is a leprous disease, who cannot afford the offerings for his cleansing.”
33 TheLordsaid to Moses and Aaron,
34 “When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put a leprous disease in a house in the land of your possession,
35 then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, ‘There seems to me to be some sort of disease in my house.’
36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes to examine the disease, lest all that is in the house be declared unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house.
37 And he shall examine the disease; and if the disease is in the walls of the house with greenish or reddish spots, and if it appears to be deeper than the surface,
38 then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
39 And the priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look; and if the disease has spread in the walls of the house,
40 then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the disease and throw them into an unclean place outside the city;
41 and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped round about, and the plaster that they scrape off they shall pour into an unclean place outside the city;
42 then they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other plaster and plaster the house.
43 “If the disease breaks out again in the house, after he has taken out the stones and scraped the house and plastered it,
44 then the priest shall go and look; and if the disease has spread in the house, it is a malignant leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
45 And he shall break down the house, its stones and timber and all the plaster of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city to an unclean place.
46 Moreover he who enters the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening;
47 and he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
48 “But if the priest comes and makes an examination, and the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, for the disease is healed.
49 And for the cleansing of the house he shall take two small birds, with cedarwood and scarlet stuff and hyssop,
50 and shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water,
51 and shall take the cedarwood and the hyssop and the scarlet stuff, along with the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
52 Thus he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet stuff;
53 and he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field; so he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.”
54 This is the law for any leprous disease: for an itch,
55 for leprosy in a garment or in a house,
56 and for a swelling or an eruption or a spot,
57 to show when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law for leprosy.


# Liber Leviticus 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen, dicens:
2 Hic est ritus leprosi, quando mundandus est. Adducetur ad sacerdotem:
3 qui egressus de castris, cum invenerit lepram esse mundatam,
4 præcipiet ei, qui purificatur, ut offerat duos passeres vivos pro se, quibus vesci licitum est, et lignum cedrinum, vermiculumque et hyssopum.
5 Et unum ex passeribus immolari jubebit in vase fictili super aquas viventes:
6 alium autem vivum cum ligno cedrino, et cocco et hyssopo, tinget in sanguine passeris immolati,
7 quo asperget illum, qui mundandus est, septies, ut jure purgetur: et dimittet passerem vivum, ut in agrum avolet.
8 Cumque laverit homo vestimenta sua, radet omnes pilos corporis, et lavabitur aqua: purificatusque ingredietur castra, ita dumtaxat ut maneat extra tabernaculum suum septem diebus,

9 et die septimo radet capillos capitis, barbamque et supercilia, ac totius corporis pilos. Et lotis rursum vestibus et corpore,
10 die octavo assumet duos agnos immaculatos, et ovem anniculam absque macula, et tres decimas similæ in sacrificium, quæ conspersa sit oleo, et seorsum olei sextarium.
11 Cumque sacerdos purificans hominem, statuerit eum, et hæc omnia coram Domino in ostio tabernaculi testimonii,
12 tollet agnum et offeret eum pro delicto, oleique sextarium: et oblatis ante Dominum omnibus,
13 immolabit agnum, ubi solet immolari hostia pro peccato, et holocaustum, id est, in loco sancto. Sicut enim pro peccato, ita et pro delicto ad sacerdotem pertinet hostia: Sancta sanctorum est.

14 Assumensque sacerdos de sanguine hostiæ, quæ immolata est pro delicto, ponet super extremum auriculæ dextræ ejus qui mundatur, et super pollices manus dextræ et pedis:
15 et de olei sextario mittet in manum suam sinistram,
16 tingetque digitum dextrum in eo, et asperget coram Domino septies.
17 Quod autem reliquum est olei in læva manu, fundet super extremum auriculæ dextræ ejus qui mundatur, et super pollices manus ac pedis dextri, et super sanguinem qui effusus est pro delicto,
18 et super caput ejus.
19 Rogabitque pro eo coram Domino, et faciet sacrificium pro peccato: tunc immolabit holocaustum,
20 et ponet illud in altari cum libamentis suis, et homo rite mundabitur.

21 Quod si pauper est, et non potest manus ejus invenire quæ dicta sunt pro delicto, assumet agnum ad oblationem, ut roget pro eo sacerdos, decimamque partem similæ conspersæ oleo in sacrificium, et olei sextarium,
22 duosque turtures sive duos pullos columbæ, quorum unus sit pro peccato, et alter in holocaustum:
23 offeretque ea die octavo purificationis suæ sacerdoti, ad ostium tabernaculi testimonii coram Domino.
24 Qui suscipiens agnum pro delicto et sextarium olei, levabit simul:
25 immolatoque agno, de sanguine ejus ponet super extremum auriculæ dextræ illius qui mundatur, et super pollices manus ejus ac pedis dextri:
26 olei vero partem mittet in manum suam sinistram,
27 in quo tingens digitum dextræ manus asperget septies coram Domino:
28 tangetque extremum dextræ auriculæ illius qui mundatur, et pollices manus ac pedis dextri, in loco sanguinis qui effusus est pro delicto:
29 reliquam autem partem olei, quæ est in sinistra manu, mittet super caput purificati, ut placet pro eo Dominum:
30 et turturem sive pullum columbæ offeret,
31 unum pro delicto, et alterum in holocaustum cum libamentis suis.
32 Hoc est sacrificium leprosi, qui habere non potest omnia in emundationem sui.

33 Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen et Aaron, dicens:
34 Cum ingressi fueritis terram Chanaan, quam ego dabo vobis in possessionem, si fuerit plaga lepræ in ædibus,
35 ibit cujus est domus, nuntians sacerdoti, et dicet: Quasi plaga lepræ videtur mihi esse in domo mea.
36 At ille præcipiet ut efferant universa de domo, priusquam ingrediatur eam, et videat utrum leprosa sit, ne immunda fiant omnia quæ in domo sunt. Intrabitque postea ut consideret lepram domus:
37 et cum viderit in parietibus illius quasi valliculas pallore sive rubore deformes, et humiliores superficie reliqua,
38 egredietur ostium domus, et statim claudet illam septem diebus.
39 Reversusque die septimo, considerabit eam: si invenerit crevisse lepram,
40 jubebit erui lapides in quibus lepra est, et projici eos extra civitatem in locum immundum:
41 domum autem ipsam radi intrinsecus per circuitum, et spargi pulverem rasuræ extra urbem in locum immundum,
42 lapidesque alios reponi pro his qui ablati fuerint, et luto alio liniri domum.

43 Sin autem postquam eruti sunt lapides, et pulvis erasus, et alia terra lita,
44 ingressus sacerdos viderit reversam lepram, et parietes respersos maculis, lepra est perseverans, et immunda domus:
45 quam statim destruent, et lapides ejus ac ligna, atque universum pulverem projicient extra oppidum in locum immundum.
46 Qui intraverit domum quando clausa est, immundus erit usque ad vesperum:
47 et qui dormierit in ea, et comederit quippiam, lavabit vestimenta sua.

48 Quod si introiens sacerdos viderit lepram non crevisse in domo, postquam denuo lita fuerit, purificabit eam reddita sanitate:
49 et in purificationem ejus sumet duos passeres, lignumque cedrinum, et vermiculum atque hyssopum:
50 et immolato uno passere in vase fictili super aquas vivas,
51 tollet lignum cedrinum, et hyssopum, et coccum, et passerem vivum, et tinget omnia in sanguine passeris immolati, atque in aquis viventibus, et asperget domum septies,
52 purificabitque eam tam in sanguine passeris quam in aquis viventibus, et in passere vivo, lignoque cedrino et hyssopo atque vermiculo.
53 Cumque dimiserit passerem avolare in agrum libere, orabit pro domo, et jure mundabitur.

54 Ista est lex omnis lepræ et percussuræ,
55 lepræ vestium et domorum,
56 cicatricis et erumpentium papularum, lucentis maculæ, et in varias species, coloribus immutatis,
57 ut possit sciri quo tempore mundum quid, vel immundum sit.

1 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων
2 οὗτος ὁ νόμος τοῦ λεπροῦ ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ καθαρισθῇ καὶ προσαχθήσεται πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα
3 καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ ἰδοὺ ἰᾶται ἡ ἁφὴ τῆς λέπρας ἀπὸ τοῦ λεπροῦ
4 καὶ προστάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ λήμψονται τῷ κεκαθαρισμένῳ δύο ὀρνίθια ζῶντα καθαρὰ καὶ ξύλον κέδρινον καὶ κεκλωσμένον κόκκινον καὶ ὕσσωπον
5 καὶ προστάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ σφάξουσιν τὸ ὀρνίθιον τὸ ἓν εἰς ἀγγεῖον ὀστράκινον ἐ{F'} ὕδατι ζῶντι
6 καὶ τὸ ὀρνίθιον τὸ ζῶν λήμψεται αὐτὸ καὶ τὸ ξύλον τὸ κέδρινον καὶ τὸ κλωστὸν κόκκινον καὶ τὸν ὕσσωπον καὶ βάψει αὐτὰ καὶ τὸ ὀρνίθιον τὸ ζῶν εἰς τὸ αἷμα τοῦ ὀρνιθίου τοῦ σφαγέντος ἐ{F'} ὕδατι ζῶντι
7 καὶ περιρρανεῖ ἐπὶ τὸν καθαρισθέντα ἀπὸ τῆς λέπρας ἑπτάκις καὶ καθαρὸς ἔσται καὶ ἐξαποστελεῖ τὸ ὀρνίθιον τὸ ζῶν εἰς τὸ πεδίον
8 καὶ πλυνεῖ ὁ καθαρισθεὶς τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ξυρηθήσεται αὐτοῦ πᾶσαν τὴν τρίχα καὶ λούσεται ἐν ὕδατι καὶ καθαρὸς ἔσται καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν καὶ διατρίψει ἔξω τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας

9 καὶ ἔσται τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ξυρηθήσεται πᾶσαν τὴν τρίχα αὐτοῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν πώγωνα καὶ τὰς ὀφρύας καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν τρίχα αὐτοῦ ξυρηθήσεται καὶ πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια καὶ λούσεται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ὕδατι καὶ καθαρὸς ἔσται
10 καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ λήμψεται δύο ἀμνοὺς ἐνιαυσίους ἀμώμους καὶ πρόβατον ἐνιαύσιον ἄμωμον καὶ τρία δέκατα σεμιδάλεως εἰς θυσίαν πεφυραμένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ καὶ κοτύλην ἐλαίου μίαν
11 καὶ στήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ καθαρίζων τὸν ἄνθρωπον τὸν καθαριζόμενον καὶ ταῦτα ἔναντι κυρίου ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου
12 καὶ λήμψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸν ἀμνὸν τὸν ἕνα καὶ προσάξει αὐτὸν τῆς πλημμελείας καὶ τὴν κοτύλην τοῦ ἐλαίου καὶ ἀφοριεῖ αὐτὸ ἀφόρισμα ἔναντι κυρίου
13 καὶ σφάξουσιν τὸν ἀμνὸν ἐν τόπῳ οὗ σφάζουσιν τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ τὰ περὶ ἁμαρτίας ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ ἔστιν γὰρ τὸ περὶ ἁμαρτίας ὥσπερ τὸ τῆς πλημμελείας ἔστιν τῷ ἱερεῖ ἅγια ἁγίων ἐστίν

14 καὶ λήμψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ τῆς πλημμελείας καὶ ἐπιθήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπὶ τὸν λοβὸν τοῦ ὠτὸς τοῦ καθαριζομένου τοῦ δεξιοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς χειρὸς τῆς δεξιᾶς καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ ποδὸς τοῦ δεξιοῦ
15 καὶ λαβὼν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τῆς κοτύλης τοῦ ἐλαίου ἐπιχεεῖ ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα τοῦ ἱερέως τὴν ἀριστερὰν

17 τὸ δὲ καταλειφθὲν ἔλαιον τὸ ὂν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ ἐπιθήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπὶ τὸν λοβὸν τοῦ ὠτὸς τοῦ καθαριζομένου τοῦ δεξιοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς χειρὸς τῆς δεξιᾶς καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ ποδὸς τοῦ δεξιοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ τῆς πλημμελείας
18 τὸ δὲ καταλειφθὲν ἔλαιον τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς χειρὸς τοῦ ἱερέως ἐπιθήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ καθαρισθέντος καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἔναντι κυρίου
19 καὶ ποιήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας καὶ ἐξιλάσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς περὶ τοῦ ἀκαθάρτου τοῦ καθαριζομένου ἀπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο σφάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα
20 καὶ ἀνοίσει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα καὶ τὴν θυσίαν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἔναντι κυρίου καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεύς καὶ καθαρισθήσεται

21 ἐὰν δὲ πένηται καὶ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ μὴ εὑρίσκῃ λήμψεται ἀμνὸν ἕνα εἰς ὃ ἐπλημμέλησεν εἰς ἀφαίρεμα ὥστε ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ δέκατον σεμιδάλεως πεφυραμένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ εἰς θυσίαν καὶ κοτύλην ἐλαίου μίαν
22 καὶ δύο τρυγόνας ἢ δύο νεοσσοὺς περιστερῶν ὅσα εὗρεν ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔσται ἡ μία περὶ ἁμαρτίας καὶ ἡ μία εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα

32 οὗτος ὁ νόμος ἐν ᾧ ἐστιν ἡ ἁφὴ τῆς λέπρας καὶ τοῦ μὴ εὑρίσκοντος τῇ χειρὶ εἰς τὸν καθαρισμὸν αὐτοῦ

33 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ααρων λέγων
34 ὡς ἂν εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν Χαναναίων ἣν ἐγὼ δίδωμι ὑμῖν ἐν κτήσει καὶ δώσω ἁφὴν λέπρας ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις τῆς γῆς τῆς ἐγκτήτου ὑμῖν
35 καὶ ἥξει τίνος αὐτοῦ ἡ οἰκία καὶ ἀναγγελεῖ τῷ ἱερεῖ λέγων ὥσπερ ἁφὴ ἑώραταί μου ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ
36 καὶ προστάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀποσκευάσαι τὴν οἰκίαν πρὸ τοῦ εἰσελθόντα ἰδεῖν τὸν ἱερέα τὴν ἁφὴν καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀκάθαρτα γένηται ὅσα ἐὰν ᾖ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς καταμαθεῖν τὴν οἰκίαν
37 καὶ ὄψεται τὴν ἁφὴν ἐν τοῖς τοίχοις τῆς οἰκίας κοιλάδας χλωριζούσας ἢ πυρριζούσας καὶ ἡ ὄψις αὐτῶν ταπεινοτέρα τῶν τοίχων
38 καὶ ἐξελθὼν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς οἰκίας καὶ ἀφοριεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν οἰκίαν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας
39 καὶ ἐπανήξει ὁ ἱερεὺς τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ καὶ ὄψεται τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐ διεχύθη ἡ ἁφὴ ἐν τοῖς τοίχοις τῆς οἰκίας
40 καὶ προστάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ ἐξελοῦσιν τοὺς λίθους ἐν οἷς ἐστιν ἡ ἁφή καὶ ἐκβαλοῦσιν αὐτοὺς ἔξω τῆς πόλεως εἰς τόπον ἀκάθαρτον
41 καὶ ἀποξύσουσιν τὴν οἰκίαν ἔσωθεν κύκλῳ καὶ ἐκχεοῦσιν τὸν χοῦν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως εἰς τόπον ἀκάθαρτον
42 καὶ λήμψονται λίθους ἀπεξυσμένους ἑτέρους καὶ ἀντιθήσουσιν ἀντὶ τῶν λίθων καὶ χοῦν ἕτερον λήμψονται καὶ ἐξαλείψουσιν τὴν οἰκίαν

43 ἐὰν δὲ ἐπέλθῃ πάλιν ἁφὴ καὶ ἀνατείλῃ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ μετὰ τὸ ἐξελεῖν τοὺς λίθους καὶ μετὰ τὸ ἀποξυσθῆναι τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ μετὰ τὸ ἐξαλειφθῆναι
44 καὶ εἰσελεύσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ ὄψεται εἰ διακέχυται ἡ ἁφὴ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ λέπρα ἔμμονός ἐστιν ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ ἀκάθαρτός ἐστιν
45 καὶ καθελοῦσιν τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ τὰ ξύλα αὐτῆς καὶ τοὺς λίθους αὐτῆς καὶ πάντα τὸν χοῦν ἐξοίσουσιν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως εἰς τόπον ἀκάθαρτον
46 καὶ ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ἀφωρισμένη ἐστίν ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας
47 καὶ ὁ κοιμώμενος ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας καὶ ὁ ἔσθων ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας

48 ἐὰν δὲ παραγενόμενος εἰσέλθῃ ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ ἴδῃ καὶ ἰδοὺ διαχύσει οὐ διαχεῖται ἡ ἁφὴ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ μετὰ τὸ ἐξαλειφθῆναι τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ καθαριεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν οἰκίαν ὅτι ἰάθη ἡ ἁφή
49 καὶ λήμψεται ἀφαγνίσαι τὴν οἰκίαν δύο ὀρνίθια ζῶντα καθαρὰ καὶ ξύλον κέδρινον καὶ κεκλωσμένον κόκκινον καὶ ὕσσωπον
50 καὶ σφάξει τὸ ὀρνίθιον τὸ ἓν εἰς σκεῦος ὀστράκινον ἐ{F'} ὕδατι ζῶντι
51 καὶ λήμψεται τὸ ξύλον τὸ κέδρινον καὶ τὸ κεκλωσμένον κόκκινον καὶ τὸν ὕσσωπον καὶ τὸ ὀρνίθιον τὸ ζῶν καὶ βάψει αὐτὸ εἰς τὸ αἷμα τοῦ ὀρνιθίου τοῦ ἐσφαγμένου ἐ{F'} ὕδατι ζῶντι καὶ περιρρανεῖ ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐπὶ τὴν οἰκίαν ἑπτάκις
52 καὶ ἀφαγνιεῖ τὴν οἰκίαν ἐν τῷ αἵματι τοῦ ὀρνιθίου καὶ ἐν τῷ ὕδατι τῷ ζῶντι καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀρνιθίῳ τῷ ζῶντι καὶ ἐν τῷ ξύλῳ τῷ κεδρίνῳ καὶ ἐν τῷ ὑσσώπῳ καὶ ἐν τῷ κεκλωσμένῳ κοκκίνῳ
53 καὶ ἐξαποστελεῖ τὸ ὀρνίθιον τὸ ζῶν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως εἰς τὸ πεδίον καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ τῆς οἰκίας καὶ καθαρὰ ἔσται

54 οὗτος ὁ νόμος κατὰ πᾶσαν ἁφὴν λέπρας καὶ θραύσματος
55 καὶ τῆς λέπρας ἱματίου καὶ οἰκίας
56 καὶ οὐλῆς καὶ σημασίας καὶ τοῦ αὐγάζοντος
57 καὶ τοῦ ἐξηγήσασθαι ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἀκάθαρτον καὶ ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ καθαρισθήσεται οὗτος ὁ νόμος τῆς λέπρας
