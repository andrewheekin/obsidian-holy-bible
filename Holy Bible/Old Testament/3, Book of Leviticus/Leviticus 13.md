### Leprosy, Varieties and Symptoms
1 TheLordsaid to Moses and Aaron,
2 “When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling or an eruption or a spot, and it turns into a leprous disease on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests,
3 and the priest shall examine the diseased spot on the skin of his body; and if the hair in the diseased spot has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous disease; when the priest has examined him he shall pronounce him unclean.
4 But if the spot is white in the skin of his body, and appears no deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall shut up the diseased person for seven days;
5 and the priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more;
6 and the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the diseased spot is dim and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only an eruption; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
7 But if the eruption spreads in the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest;
8 and the priest shall make an examination, and if the eruption has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.
9 “When a man is afflicted with leprosy, he shall be brought to the priest;
10 and the priest shall make an examination, and if there is a white swelling in the skin, which has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the swelling,
11 it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
12 And if the leprosy breaks out in the skin, so that the leprosy covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see,
13 then the priest shall make an examination, and if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; it has all turned white, and he is clean.
14 But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.
15 And the priest shall examine the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean; raw flesh is unclean, for it is leprosy.
16 But if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest,
17 and the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean; he is clean.
18 “And when there is in the skin of one’s body a boil that has healed,
19 and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a reddish-white spot, then it shall be shown to the priest;
20 and the priest shall make an examination, and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the disease of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil.
21 But if the priest examines it, and the hair on it is not white and it is not deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall shut him up seven days;
22 and if it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is diseased.
23 But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
24 “Or, when the body has a burn on its skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot, reddish-white or white,
25 the priest shall examine it, and if the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, then it is leprosy; it has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.
26 But if the priest examines it, and the hair in the spot is not white and it is no deeper than the skin, but is dim, the priest shall shut him up seven days,
27 and the priest shall examine him the seventh day; if it is spreading in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.
28 But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread in the skin, but is dim, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar of the burn.
29 “When a man or woman has a disease on the head or the beard,
30 the priest shall examine the disease; and if it appears deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an itch, a leprosy of the head or the beard.
31 And if the priest examines the itching disease, and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days,
32 and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the disease; and if the itch has not spread, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin,
33 then he shall shave himself, but the itch he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days more;
34 and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch, and if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
35 But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing,
36 then the priest shall examine him, and if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
37 But if in his eyes the itch is checked, and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
38 “When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots,
39 the priest shall make an examination, and if the spots on the skin of the body are of a dull white, it is tetter that has broken out in the skin; he is clean.
40 “If a man’s hair has fallen from his head, he is bald but he is clean.
41 And if a man’s hair has fallen from his forehead and temples, he has baldness of the forehead but he is clean.
42 But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white diseased spot, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.
43 Then the priest shall examine him, and if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body,
44 he is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest must pronounce him unclean; his disease is on his head.
45 “The leper who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head hang loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry, ‘Unclean, unclean.’
46 He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease; he is unclean; he shall dwell alone in a habitation outside the camp.
47 “When there is a leprous disease in a garment, whether a woolen or a linen garment,
48 in warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin,
49 if the disease shows greenish or reddish in the garment, whether in warp or woof or in skin or in anything made of skin, it is a leprous disease and shall be shown to the priest.
50 And the priest shall examine the disease, and shut up that which has the disease for seven days;
51 then he shall examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread in the garment, in warp or woof, or in the skin, whatever be the use of the skin, the disease is a malignant leprosy; it is unclean.
52 And he shall burn the garment, whether diseased in warp or woof, woolen or linen, or anything of skin, for it is a malignant leprosy; it shall be burned in the fire.
53 “And if the priest examines, and the disease has not spread in the garment in warp or woof or in anything of skin,
54 then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the disease, and he shall shut it up seven days more;
55 and the priest shall examine the diseased thing after it has been washed. And if the diseased spot has not changed color, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, whether the leprous spot is on the back or on the front.
56 “But if the priest examines, and the disease is dim after it is washed, he shall tear the spot out of the garment or the skin or the warp or woof;
57 then if it appears again in the garment, in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading; you shall burn with fire that in which is the disease.
58 But the garment, warp or woof, or anything of skin from which the disease departs when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and be clean.”
59 This is the law for a leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen, either in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, to decide whether it is clean or unclean.


# Liber Leviticus 13 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen, et Aaron, dicens:
2 Homo, in cujus cute et carne ortus fuerit diversus color, sive pustula, aut quasi lucens quippiam, id est, plaga lepræ, adducetur ad Aaron sacerdotem, vel ad unum quemlibet filiorum ejus.
3 Qui cum viderit lepram in cute, et pilos in album mutatos colorem, ipsamque speciem lepræ humiliorem cute et carne reliqua: plaga lepræ est, et ad arbitrium ejus separabitur.
4 Sin autem lucens candor fuerit in cute, nec humilior carne reliqua, et pili coloris pristini, recludet eum sacerdos septem diebus:
5 et considerabit die septimo: et si quidem lepra ultra non creverit, nec transierit in cute priores terminos, rursum recludet eum septem diebus aliis.
6 Et die septimo contemplabitur: si obscurior fuerit lepra, et non creverit in cute, mundabit eum, quia scabies est: lavabitque homo vestimenta sua, et mundus erit.
7 Quod si postquam a sacerdote visus est, et redditus munditiæ, iterum lepra creverit: adducetur ad eum,
8 et immunditiæ condemnabitur.

9 Plaga lepræ si fuerit in homine, adducetur ad sacerdotem,
10 et videbit eum. Cumque color albus in cute fuerit, et capillorum mutaverit aspectum, ipsa quoque caro viva apparuerit:
11 lepra vetustissima judicabitur, atque inolita cuti. Contaminabit itaque eum sacerdos, et non recludet, quia perspicuæ immunditiæ est.
12 Sin autem effloruerit discurrens lepra in cute, et operuerit omnem cutem a capite usque ad pedes, quidquid sub aspectum oculorum cadit,
13 considerabit eum sacerdos, et teneri lepra mundissima judicabit: eo quod omnis in candorem versa sit, et idcirco homo mundus erit.
14 Quando vero caro vivens in eo apparuerit,
15 tunc sacerdotis judicio polluetur, et inter immundos reputabitur: caro enim viva, si lepra aspergitur, immunda est.
16 Quod si rursum versa fuerit in alborem, et totum hominem operuerit,
17 considerabit eum sacerdos, et mundum esse decernet.

18 Caro autem et cutis in qua ulcus natum est, et sanatum,
19 et in loco ulceris cicatrix alba apparuerit, sive subrufa, adducetur homo ad sacerdotem.
20 Qui cum viderit locum lepræ humiliorem carne reliqua, et pilos versos in candorem, contaminabit eum: plaga enim lepræ orta est in ulcere.
21 Quod si pilus coloris est pristini, et cicatrix subobscura, et vicina carne non est humilior, recludet eum septem diebus:
22 et si quidem creverit, adjudicabit eum lepræ;
23 sin autem steterit in loco suo, ulceris est cicatrix, et homo mundus erit.

24 Caro autem et cutis, quam ignis exusserit, et sanata albam sive rufam habuerit cicatricem,
25 considerabit eam sacerdos: et ecce versa est in alborem, et locus ejus reliqua cute est humilior, contaminabit eum, quia plaga lepræ in cicatrice orta est.
26 Quod si pilorum color non fuerit immutatus, nec humilior plaga carne reliqua, et ipsa lepræ species fuerit subobscura, recludet eum septem diebus,
27 et die septimo contemplabitur: si creverit in cute lepra, contaminabit eum.
28 Sin autem in loco suo candor steterit non satis clarus, plaga combustionis est, et idcirco mundabitur, quia cicatrix est combusturæ.

29 Vir, sive mulier, in cujus capite vel barba germinaverit lepra, videbit eos sacerdos.
30 Et si quidem humilior fuerit locus carne reliqua, et capillus flavus, solitoque subtilior, contaminabit eos, quia lepra capitis ac barbæ est.
31 Sin autem viderit locum maculæ æqualem vicinæ carni, et capillum nigrum: recludet eum septem diebus,
32 et die septimo intuebitur. Si non creverit macula, et capillus sui coloris est, et locus plagæ carni reliquæ æqualis:
33 radetur homo absque loco maculæ, et includetur septem diebus aliis.
34 Si die septimo visa fuerit stetisse plaga in loco suo, nec humilior carne reliqua, mundabit eum: lotisque vestibus suis, mundus erit.
35 Sin autem post emundationem rursus creverit macula in cute,
36 non quæret amplius utrum capillus in flavum colorem sit immutatus, quia aperte immundus est.
37 Porro si steterit macula, et capilli nigri fuerint, noverit hominem sanatum esse, et confidenter eum pronuntiet mundum.

38 Vir, sive mulier, in cujus cute candor apparuerit,
39 intuebitur eos sacerdos. Si deprehenderit subobscurum alborem lucere in cute, sciat non esse lepram, sed maculam coloris candidi, et hominem mundum.

40 Vir, de cujus capite capilli fluunt, calvus et mundus est:
41 et si a fronte ceciderint pili, recalvaster et mundus est.
42 Sin autem in calvitio sive in recalvatione albus vel rufus color fuerit exortus,
43 et hoc sacerdos viderit, condemnabit eum haud dubiæ lepræ, quæ orta est in calvitio.

44 Quicumque ergo maculatus fuerit lepra, et separatus est ad arbitrium sacerdotis,
45 habebit vestimenta dissuta, caput nudum, os veste contectum, contaminatum ac sordidum se clamabit.
46 Omni tempore quo leprosus est et immundus, solus habitabit extra castra.

47 Vestis lanea sive linea, quæ lepram habuerit,
48 in stamine atque subtegmine, aut certe pellis, vel quidquid ex pelle confectum est,
49 si alba vel rufa macula fuerit infecta, lepra reputabitur, ostendeturque sacerdoti:
50 qui consideratam recludet septem diebus:
51 et die septimo rursus aspiciens, si deprehenderit crevisse, lepra perseverans est: pollutum judicabit vestimentum, et omne in quo fuerit inventa:
52 et idcirco comburetur flammis.
53 Quod si eam viderit non crevisse,
54 præcipiet, et lavabunt id in quo lepra est, recludetque illud septem diebus aliis.
55 Et cum viderit faciem quidem pristinam non reversam, nec tamen crevisse lepram, immundum judicabit, et igne comburet, eo quod infusa sit in superficie vestimenti, vel per totum, lepra.
56 Sin autem obscurior fuerit locus lepræ, postquam vestis est lota, abrumpet eum, et a solido dividet.
57 Quod si ultra apparuerit in his locis, quæ prius immaculata erant, lepra volatilis et vaga, debet igne comburi.
58 Si cessaverit, lavabit aqua ea, quæ pura sunt, secundo, et munda erunt.
59 Ista est lex lepræ vestimenti lanei et linei, staminis, atque subtegminis, omnisque supellectilis pelliceæ, quomodo mundari debeat, vel contaminari.

46 πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ὅσας ἂν ᾖ ἐ{P'} αὐτοῦ ἡ ἁφή ἀκάθαρτος ὢν ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται κεχωρισμένος καθήσεται ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς ἔσται αὐτοῦ ἡ διατριβή

47 καὶ ἱματίῳ ἐὰν γένηται ἐν αὐτῷ ἁφὴ λέπρας ἐν ἱματίῳ ἐρεῷ ἢ ἐν ἱματίῳ στιππυίνῳ

50 καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἁφήν καὶ ἀφοριεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἁφὴν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας
51 καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἁφὴν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἐὰν δὲ διαχέηται ἡ ἁφὴ ἐν τῷ ἱματίῳ ἢ ἐν τῷ στήμονι ἢ ἐν τῇ κρόκῃ ἢ ἐν τῷ δέρματι κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἂν ποιηθῇ δέρματα ἐν τῇ ἐργασίᾳ λέπρα ἔμμονός ἐστιν ἡ ἁφή ἀκάθαρτός ἐστιν
52 κατακαύσει τὸ ἱμάτιον ἢ τὸν στήμονα ἢ τὴν κρόκην ἐν τοῖς ἐρεοῖς ἢ ἐν τοῖς λινοῖς ἢ ἐν παντὶ σκεύει δερματίνῳ ἐν ᾧ ἐὰν ᾖ ἐν αὐτῷ ἡ ἁφή ὅτι λέπρα ἔμμονός ἐστιν ἐν πυρὶ κατακαυθήσεται
53 ἐὰν δὲ ἴδῃ ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ μὴ διαχέηται ἡ ἁφὴ ἐν τῷ ἱματίῳ ἢ ἐν τῷ στήμονι ἢ ἐν τῇ κρόκῃ ἢ ἐν παντὶ σκεύει δερματίνῳ
54 καὶ συντάξει ὁ ἱερεύς καὶ πλυνεῖ ἐ{F'} οὗ ἐὰν ᾖ ἐ{P'} αὐτοῦ ἡ ἁφή καὶ ἀφοριεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἁφὴν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας τὸ δεύτερον
55 καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς μετὰ τὸ πλυθῆναι αὐτὸ τὴν ἁφήν καὶ ἥδε μὴ μετέβαλεν τὴν ὄψιν ἡ ἁφή καὶ ἡ ἁφὴ οὐ διαχεῖται ἀκάθαρτόν ἐστιν ἐν πυρὶ κατακαυθήσεται ἐστήρισται ἐν τῷ ἱματίῳ ἢ ἐν τῷ στήμονι ἢ ἐν τῇ κρόκῃ
56 καὶ ἐὰν ἴδῃ ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ ᾖ ἀμαυρὰ ἡ ἁφὴ μετὰ τὸ πλυθῆναι αὐτό ἀπορρήξει αὐτὸ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἱματίου ἢ ἀπὸ τοῦ δέρματος ἢ ἀπὸ τοῦ στήμονος ἢ ἀπὸ τῆς κρόκης
57 ἐὰν δὲ ὀφθῇ ἔτι ἐν τῷ ἱματίῳ ἢ ἐν τῷ στήμονι ἢ ἐν τῇ κρόκῃ ἢ ἐν παντὶ σκεύει δερματίνῳ λέπρα ἐξανθοῦσά ἐστιν ἐν πυρὶ κατακαυθήσεται ἐν ᾧ ἐστὶν ἡ ἁφή
58 καὶ τὸ ἱμάτιον ἢ ὁ στήμων ἢ ἡ κρόκη ἢ πᾶν σκεῦος δερμάτινον ὃ πλυθήσεται καὶ ἀποστήσεται ἀ{P'} αὐτοῦ ἡ ἁφή καὶ πλυθήσεται τὸ δεύτερον καὶ καθαρὸν ἔσται
59 οὗτος ὁ νόμος ἁφῆς λέπρας ἱματίου ἐρεοῦ ἢ στιππυίνου ἢ στήμονος ἢ κρόκης ἢ παντὸς σκεύους δερματίνου εἰς τὸ καθαρίσαι αὐτὸ ἢ μιᾶναι αὐτό
