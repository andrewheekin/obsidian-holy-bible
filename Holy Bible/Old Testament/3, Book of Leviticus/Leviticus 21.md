# Book of Leviticus 21 (RSVCE)

### The Holiness of Priests
1 And theLordsaid to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them that none of them shall defile himself for the dead among his people,
2 except for his nearest of kin, his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, his brother,
3 or his virgin sister (who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may defile himself).
4 He shall not defile himself as a husband among his people and so profane himself.
5 They shall not make tonsures upon their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
6 They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God; for they offer the offerings by fire to theLord, the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
7 They shall not marry a harlot or a woman who has been defiled; neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband; for the priest is holy to his God.
8 You shall consecrate him, for he offers the bread of your God; he shall be holy to you; for I theLord, who sanctify you, am holy.
9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire.
10 “The priest who is chief among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose, nor rend his clothes;
11 he shall not go in to any dead body, nor defile himself, even for his father or for his mother;
12 neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am theLord.
13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
14 A widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled, or a harlot, these he shall not marry; but he shall take to wife a virgin of his own people,
15 that he may not profane his children among his people; for I am theLordwho sanctify him.”
16 And theLordsaid to Moses,
17 “Say to Aaron, None of your descendants throughout their generations who has a blemish may approach to offer the bread of his God.
18 For no one who has a blemish shall draw near, a man blind or lame, or one who has a mutilated face or a limb too long,
19 or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand,
20 or a hunchback, or a dwarf, or a man with a defect in his sight or an itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles;
21 no man of the descendants of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer theLord’s offerings by fire; since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
22 He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy things,
23 but he shall not come near the veil or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not profane my sanctuaries; for I am theLordwho sanctify them.”
24 So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the people of Israel.


# Liber Leviticus 21 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dixit quoque Dominus ad Moysen: Loquere ad sacerdotes filios Aaron, et dices ad eos: Ne contaminetur sacerdos in mortibus civium suorum,
2 nisi tantum in consanguineis, ac propinquis, id est, super patre et matre, et filio, et filia, fratre quoque,
3 et sorore virgine quæ non est nupta viro:
4 sed nec in principe populi sui contaminabitur.

5 Non radent caput, nec barbam, neque in carnibus suis facient incisuras.
6 Sancti erunt Deo suo, et non polluent nomen ejus: incensum enim Domini, et panes Dei sui offerunt, et ideo sancti erunt.
7 Scortum et vile prostibulum non ducent uxorem, nec eam quæ repudiata est a marito: quia consecrati sunt Deo suo,
8 et panes propositionis offerunt. Sint ergo sancti, quia et ego sanctus sum, Dominus qui sanctifico eos.
9 Sacerdotis filia si deprehensa fuerit in stupro, et violaverit nomen patris sui, flammis exuretur.

10 Pontifex, id est, sacerdos maximus inter fratres suos, super cujus caput fusum est unctionis oleum, et cujus manus in sacerdotio consecratæ sunt, vestitusque est sanctis vestibus, caput suum non discooperiet, vestimenta non scindet:
11 et ad omnem mortuum non ingredietur omnino: super patre quoque suo et matre non contaminabitur.
12 Nec egredietur de sanctis, ne polluat sanctuarium Domini, quia oleum sanctæ unctionis Dei sui super eum est. Ego Dominus.
13 Virginem ducet uxorem:
14 viduam autem et repudiatam, et sordidam, atque meretricem non accipiet, sed puellam de populo suo:
15 ne commisceat stirpem generis sui vulgo gentis suæ: quia ego Dominus, qui sanctifico eum.

16 Locutusque est Dominus ad Moysen, dicens:
17 Loquere ad Aaron: Homo de semine tuo per familias qui habuerit maculam, non offeret panes Deo suo,
18 nec accedet ad ministerium ejus: si cæcus fuerit, si claudus, si parvo vel grandi, vel torto naso,
19 si fracto pede, si manu,
20 si gibbus, si lippus, si albuginem habens in oculo, si jugem scabiem, si impetiginem in corpore, vel herniosus.
21 Omnis qui habuerit maculam de semine Aaron sacerdotis, non accedet offerre hostias Domino, nec panes Deo suo:
22 vescetur tamen panibus qui offeruntur in sanctuario,
23 ita dumtaxat, ut intra velum non ingrediatur, nec accedat ad altare, quia maculam habet, et contaminare non debet sanctuarium meum. Ego Dominus qui sanctifico eos.

24 Locutus est ergo Moyses ad Aaron, et ad filios ejus, et ad omnem Israël cuncta quæ fuerant sibi imperata.

1 καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων εἰπὸν τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ααρων καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς ἐν ταῖς ψυχαῖς οὐ μιανθήσονται ἐν τῷ ἔθνει αὐτῶν
2 ἀλ{L'} ἢ ἐν τῷ οἰκείῳ τῷ ἔγγιστα αὐτῶν ἐπὶ πατρὶ καὶ μητρὶ καὶ υἱοῖς καὶ θυγατράσιν ἐ{P'} ἀδελφῷ
3 καὶ ἐ{P'} ἀδελφῇ παρθένῳ τῇ ἐγγιζούσῃ αὐτῷ τῇ μὴ ἐκδεδομένῃ ἀνδρί ἐπὶ τούτοις μιανθήσεται
4 οὐ μιανθήσεται ἐξάπινα ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ εἰς βεβήλωσιν αὐτοῦ

5 καὶ φαλάκρωμα οὐ ξυρηθήσεσθε τὴν κεφαλὴν ἐπὶ νεκρῷ καὶ τὴν ὄψιν τοῦ πώγωνος οὐ ξυρήσονται καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς σάρκας αὐτῶν οὐ κατατεμοῦσιν ἐντομίδας
6 ἅγιοι ἔσονται τῷ θεῷ αὐτῶν καὶ οὐ βεβηλώσουσιν τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτῶν τὰς γὰρ θυσίας κυρίου δῶρα τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτῶν αὐτοὶ προσφέρουσιν καὶ ἔσονται ἅγιοι
7 γυναῖκα πόρνην καὶ βεβηλωμένην οὐ λήμψονται καὶ γυναῖκα ἐκβεβλημένην ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς ἅγιός ἐστιν τῷ κυρίῳ θεῷ αὐτοῦ
8 καὶ ἁγιάσει αὐτόν τὰ δῶρα κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν οὗτος προσφέρει ἅγιος ἔσται ὅτι ἅγιος ἐγὼ κύριος ὁ ἁγιάζων αὐτούς
9 καὶ θυγάτηρ ἀνθρώπου ἱερέως ἐὰν βεβηλωθῇ τοῦ ἐκπορνεῦσαι τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς αὐτὴ βεβηλοῖ ἐπὶ πυρὸς κατακαυθήσεται

10 καὶ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας ἀπὸ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἐπικεχυμένου ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ ἐλαίου τοῦ χριστοῦ καὶ τετελειωμένου ἐνδύσασθαι τὰ ἱμάτια τὴν κεφαλὴν οὐκ ἀποκιδαρώσει καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια οὐ διαρρήξει
11 καὶ ἐπὶ πάσῃ ψυχῇ τετελευτηκυίᾳ οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται ἐπὶ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ ἐπὶ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ οὐ μιανθήσεται
12 καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων οὐκ ἐξελεύσεται καὶ οὐ βεβηλώσει τὸ ἡγιασμένον τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ ὅτι τὸ ἅγιον ἔλαιον τὸ χριστὸν τοῦ θεοῦ ἐ{P'} αὐτῷ ἐγὼ κύριος
13 οὗτος γυναῖκα παρθένον ἐκ τοῦ γένους αὐτοῦ λήμψεται
14 χήραν δὲ καὶ ἐκβεβλημένην καὶ βεβηλωμένην καὶ πόρνην ταύτας οὐ λήμψεται ἀλ{L'} ἢ παρθένον ἐκ τοῦ γένους αὐτοῦ λήμψεται γυναῖκα
15 καὶ οὐ βεβηλώσει τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ ἐγὼ κύριος ὁ ἁγιάζων αὐτόν

16 καὶ ἐλάλησεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων
17 εἰπὸν Ααρων ἄνθρωπος ἐκ τοῦ γένους σου εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν τίνι ἐὰν ᾖ ἐν αὐτῷ μῶμος οὐ προσελεύσεται προσφέρειν τὰ δῶρα τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ
18 πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ᾧ ἂν ᾖ ἐν αὐτῷ μῶμος οὐ προσελεύσεται ἄνθρωπος χωλὸς ἢ τυφλὸς ἢ κολοβόρριν ἢ ὠτότμητος
19 ἢ ἄνθρωπος ᾧ ἐστιν ἐν αὐτῷ σύντριμμα χειρὸς ἢ σύντριμμα ποδός
20 ἢ κυρτὸς ἢ ἔφηλος ἢ πτίλος τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἢ ἄνθρωπος ᾧ ἂν ᾖ ἐν αὐτῷ ψώρα ἀγρία ἢ λιχήν ἢ μόνορχις
21 πᾶς ᾧ ἐστιν ἐν αὐτῷ μῶμος ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος Ααρων τοῦ ἱερέως οὐκ ἐγγιεῖ τοῦ προσενεγκεῖν τὰς θυσίας τῷ θεῷ σου ὅτι μῶμος ἐν αὐτῷ τὰ δῶρα τοῦ θεοῦ οὐ προσελεύσεται προσενεγκεῖν
22 τὰ δῶρα τοῦ θεοῦ τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἁγίων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἁγίων φάγεται
23 πλὴν πρὸς τὸ καταπέτασμα οὐ προσελεύσεται καὶ πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον οὐκ ἐγγιεῖ ὅτι μῶμον ἔχει καὶ οὐ βεβηλώσει τὸ ἅγιον τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι κύριος ὁ ἁγιάζων αὐτούς

24 καὶ ἐλάλησεν Μωυσῆς πρὸς Ααρων καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ πρὸς πάντας υἱοὺς Ισραηλ
