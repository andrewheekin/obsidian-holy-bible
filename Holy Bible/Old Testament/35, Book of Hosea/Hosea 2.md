# Book of Hosea 2 (RSVCE)

1 Say to your brother, “My people,” and to your sister, “She has obtained pity.”
### Israel’s Infidelity, Punishment, and Redemption
2 “Plead with your mother, plead— for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband— that she put away her harlotry from her face, and her adultery from between her breasts;
3 lest I strip her naked and make her as in the day she was born, and make her like a wilderness, and set her like a parched land, and slay her with thirst.
4 Upon her children also I will have no pity, because they are children of harlotry.
5 For their mother has played the harlot; she that conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, ‘I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.’
6 Therefore I will hedge up her way with thorns; and I will build a wall against her, so that she cannot find her paths.
7 She shall pursue her lovers, but not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Then she shall say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better with me then than now.’
8 And she did not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the wine, and the oil, and who lavished upon her silver and gold which they used for Baʹal.
9 Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my wine in its season; and I will take away my wool and my flax, which were to cover her nakedness.
10 Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and no one shall rescue her out of my hand.
11 And I will put an end to all her mirth, her feasts, her new moons, her sabbaths, and all her appointed feasts.
12 And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, of which she said, ‘These are my hire, which my lovers have given me.’ I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall devour them.
13 And I will punish her for the feast days of the Baʹals when she burned incense to them and decked herself with her ring and jewelry, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says theLord.
14 “Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.
15 And there I will give her her vineyards, and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt.
16 “And in that day, says theLord, you will call me, ‘My husband,’ and no longer will you call me, ‘My Baʹal.’
17 For I will remove the names of the Baʹals from her mouth, and they shall be mentioned by name no more.
18 And I will make for you a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the creeping things of the ground; and I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land; and I will make you lie down in safety.
19 And I will betroth you to me for ever; I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love, and in mercy.
20 I will betroth you to me in faithfulness; and you shall know theLord.
21 “And in that day, says theLord, I will answer the heavens and they shall answer the earth;
22 and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel;i
23 and I will sow him for myself in the land. And I will have pity on Not pitied, and I will say to Not my people, ‘You are my people’; and he shall say, ‘Thou art my God.’ ”


# Prophetia Osee 2 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dicite fratribus vestris: Populus meus; et sorori vestræ: Misericordiam consecuta.
2 Judicate matrem vestram, judicate,quoniam ipsa non uxor mea,et ego non vir ejus.Auferat fornicationes suas a facie sua,et adulteria sua de medio uberum suorum;
3 ne forte expoliem eam nudam,et statuam eam secundum diem nativitatis suæ,et ponam eam quasi solitudinem,et statuam eam velut terram inviam,et interficiam eam siti.
4 Et filiorum illius non miserebor,quoniam filii fornicationum sunt.

5 Quia fornicata est mater eorum,confusa est quæ concepit eos;quia dixit: Vadam post amatores meos,qui dant panes mihi, et aquas meas,lanam meam, et linum meum,oleum meum, et potum meum.
6 Propter hoc ecce ego sepiam viam tuam spinis,et sepiam eam maceria, et semitas suas non inveniet.
7 Et sequetur amatores suos, et non apprehendet eos;et quæret eos, et non inveniet:et dicet: Vadam, et revertar ad virum meum priorem,quia bene mihi erat tunc magis quam nunc.

8 Et hæc nescivit, quia ego dedi ei frumentum, et vinum, et oleum,et argentum multiplicavi ei, et aurum,quæ fecerunt Baal.
9 Idcirco convertar, et sumam frumentum meum in tempore suo,et vinum meum in tempore suo.Et liberabo lanam meam et linum meum,quæ operiebant ignominiam ejus.
10 Et nunc revelabo stultitiam ejus in oculis amatorum ejus;et vir non eruet eam de manu mea;
11 et cessare faciam omne gaudium ejus,solemnitatem ejus, neomeniam ejus, sabbatum ejus,et omnia festa tempora ejus.
12 Et corrumpam vineam ejus, et ficum ejus,de quibus dixit: Mercedes hæ meæ sunt,quas dederunt mihi amatores mei;et ponam eam in saltum,et comedet eam bestia agri.
13 Et visitabo super eam dies Baalim,quibus accendebat incensum,et ornabatur in aure sua, et monili suo.Et ibat post amatores suos,et mei obliviscebatur, dicit Dominus.

14 Propter hoc ecce ego lactabo eam,et ducam eam in solitudinem,et loquar ad cor ejus.
15 Et dabo ei vinitores ejus ex eodem loco,et vallem Achor, ad aperiendam spem;et canet ibi juxta dies juventutis suæ,et juxta dies ascensionis suæ de terra Ægypti.
16 Et erit in die illa, ait Dominus:vocabit me, Vir meus,et non vocabit me ultra Baali.
17 Et auferam nomina Baalim de ore ejus,et non recordabitur ultra nominis eorum.
18 Et percutiam cum eis fœdus in die illa, cum bestia agri,et cum volucre cæli, et cum reptili terræ;et arcum, et gladium, et bellum conteram de terra,et dormire eos faciam fiducialiter.

19 Et sponsabo te mihi in sempiternum;et sponsabo te mihi in justitia, et judicio,et in misericordia, et in miserationibus.
20 Et sponsabo te mihi in fide;et scies quia ego Dominus.
21 Et erit in die illa:exaudiam, dicit Dominus, exaudiam cælos,et illi exaudient terram.
22 Et terra exaudiet triticum, et vinum, et oleum,et hæc exaudient Jezrahel.
23 Et seminabo eam mihi in terra,et miserebor ejus quæ fuit Absque misericordia.
24 Et dicam Non populo meo: Populus meus es tu;et ipse dicet: Deus meus es tu.


# Ὡσηέ 2 (Septuagint)

1 εἴπατε τῷ ἀδελφῷ ὑμῶν Λαό{S-}μου καὶ τῇ ἀδελφῇ ὑμῶν Ἠλεημένη
2 κρίθητε πρὸς τὴν μητέρα ὑμῶν κρίθητε ὅτι αὐτὴ οὐ γυνή μου καὶ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς καὶ ἐξαρῶ τὴν πορνείαν αὐτῆς ἐκ προσώπου μου καὶ τὴν μοιχείαν αὐτῆς ἐκ μέσου μαστῶν αὐτῆς
3 ὅπως ἂν ἐκδύσω αὐτὴν γυμνὴν καὶ ἀποκαταστήσω αὐτὴν καθὼς ἡμέρᾳ γενέσεως αὐτῆς καὶ θήσομαι αὐτὴν ὡς ἔρημον καὶ τάξω αὐτὴν ὡς γῆν ἄνυδρον καὶ ἀποκτενῶ αὐτὴν ἐν δίψει
4 καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς οὐ μὴ ἐλεήσω ὅτι τέκνα πορνείας ἐστίν

5 ὅτι ἐξεπόρνευσεν ἡ μήτηρ αὐτῶν κατῄσχυνεν ἡ τεκοῦσα αὐτά εἶπεν γάρ ἀκολουθήσω ὀπίσω τῶν ἐραστῶν μου τῶν διδόντων μοι τοὺς ἄρτους μου καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ μου καὶ τὰ ἱμάτιά μου καὶ τὰ ὀθόνιά μου καὶ τὸ ἔλαιόν μου καὶ πάντα ὅσα μοι καθήκει
6 διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ φράσσω τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῆς ἐν σκόλοψιν καὶ ἀνοικοδομήσω τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῆς καὶ τὴν τρίβον αὐτῆς οὐ μὴ εὕρῃ
7 καὶ καταδιώξεται τοὺς ἐραστὰς αὐτῆς καὶ οὐ μὴ καταλάβῃ αὐτούς καὶ ζητήσει αὐτοὺς καὶ οὐ μὴ εὕρῃ αὐτούς καὶ ἐρεῖ πορεύσομαι καὶ ἐπιστρέψω πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα μου τὸν πρότερον ὅτι καλῶς μοι ἦν τότε ἢ νῦν

8 καὶ αὐτὴ οὐκ ἔγνω ὅτι ἐγὼ δέδωκα αὐτῇ τὸν σῖτον καὶ τὸν οἶνον καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον καὶ ἀργύριον ἐπλήθυνα αὐτῇ αὐτὴ δὲ ἀργυρᾶ καὶ χρυσᾶ ἐποίησεν τῇ Βααλ
9 διὰ τοῦτο ἐπιστρέψω καὶ κομιοῦμαι τὸν σῖτόν μου κα{Q'} ὥραν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν οἶνόν μου ἐν καιρῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀφελοῦμαι τὰ ἱμάτιά μου καὶ τὰ ὀθόνιά μου τοῦ μὴ καλύπτειν τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτῆς
10 καὶ νῦν ἀποκαλύψω τὴν ἀκαθαρσίαν αὐτῆς ἐνώπιον τῶν ἐραστῶν αὐτῆς καὶ οὐδεὶς οὐ μὴ ἐξέληται αὐτὴν ἐκ χειρός μου
11 καὶ ἀποστρέψω πάσας τὰς εὐφροσύνας αὐτῆς ἑορτὰς αὐτῆς καὶ τὰς νουμηνίας αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ σάββατα αὐτῆς καὶ πάσας τὰς πανηγύρεις αὐτῆς
12 καὶ ἀφανιῶ ἄμπελον αὐτῆς καὶ τὰς συκᾶς αὐτῆς ὅσα εἶπεν μισθώματά μου ταῦτά ἐστιν ἃ ἔδωκάν μοι οἱ ἐρασταί μου καὶ θήσομαι αὐτὰ εἰς μαρτύριον καὶ καταφάγεται αὐτὰ τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τὰ ἑρπετὰ τῆς γῆς
13 καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐ{P'} αὐτὴν τὰς ἡμέρας τῶν Βααλιμ ἐν αἷς ἐπέθυεν αὐτοῖς καὶ περιετίθετο τὰ ἐνώτια αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ καθόρμια αὐτῆς καὶ ἐπορεύετο ὀπίσω τῶν ἐραστῶν αὐτῆς ἐμοῦ δὲ ἐπελάθετο λέγει κύριος

14 διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πλανῶ αὐτὴν καὶ τάξω αὐτὴν εἰς ἔρημον καὶ λαλήσω ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῆς
15 καὶ δώσω αὐτῇ τὰ κτήματα αὐτῆς ἐκεῖθεν καὶ τὴν κοιλάδα Αχωρ διανοῖξαι σύνεσιν αὐτῆς καὶ ταπεινωθήσεται ἐκεῖ κατὰ τὰς ἡμέρας νηπιότητος αὐτῆς καὶ κατὰ τὰς ἡμέρας ἀναβάσεως αὐτῆς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου
16 καὶ ἔσται ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ λέγει κύριος καλέσει με ὁ ἀνήρ μου καὶ οὐ καλέσει με ἔτι Βααλιμ
17 καὶ ἐξαρῶ τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν Βααλιμ ἐκ στόματος αὐτῆς καὶ οὐ μὴ μνησθῶσιν οὐκέτι τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν
18 καὶ διαθήσομαι αὐτοῖς ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ διαθήκην μετὰ τῶν θηρίων τοῦ ἀγροῦ καὶ μετὰ τῶν πετεινῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ μετὰ τῶν ἑρπετῶν τῆς γῆς καὶ τόξον καὶ ῥομφαίαν καὶ πόλεμον συντρίψω ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ κατοικιῶ σε ἐ{P'} ἐλπίδι

19 καὶ μνηστεύσομαί σε ἐμαυτῷ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα καὶ μνηστεύσομαί σε ἐμαυτῷ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ ἐν κρίματι καὶ ἐν ἐλέει καὶ ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς
20 καὶ μνηστεύσομαί σε ἐμαυτῷ ἐν πίστει καὶ ἐπιγνώσῃ τὸν κύριον
21 καὶ ἔσται ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ λέγει κύριος ἐπακούσομαι τῷ οὐρανῷ καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς ἐπακούσεται τῇ γῇ
22 καὶ ἡ γῆ ἐπακούσεται τὸν σῖτον καὶ τὸν οἶνον καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον καὶ αὐτὰ ἐπακούσεται τῷ Ιεζραελ
23 καὶ σπερῶ αὐτὴν ἐμαυτῷ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐλεήσω τὴν Οὐ{K-}ἠλεημένην
24 καὶ ἐρῶ τῷ Ο{U)-}λα{W=|-}μου λαός μου εἶ σύ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐρεῖ κύριος ὁ θεός μου εἶ σύ
