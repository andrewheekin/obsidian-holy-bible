# Gospel According to Saint Luke 23 (RSVCE)

### Jesus before Pilate
1 Then the whole company of them arose, and brought him before Pilate.
2 And they began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.”
3 And Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, “You have said so.”
4 And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no crime in this man.”
5 But they were urgent, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.”
### Jesus before Herod
6 When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
7 And when he learned that he belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.
8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him.
9 So he questioned him at some length; but he made no answer.
10 The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.
11 And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel, he sent him back to Pilate.
12 And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.
### Jesus Sentenced to Death
13 Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
14 and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him;
15 neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him;
16 I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
18 But they all cried out together, “Away with this man, and release to us Barabʹbas”—
19 a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder.
20 Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus;
21 but they shouted out, “Crucify, crucify him!”
22 A third time he said to them, “Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
23 But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed.
24 So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.
25 He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.
### The Crucifixion of Jesus
26 And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyreʹne, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.
27 And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.
28 But Jesus turning to them said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
29 For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck!’
30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us’; and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’
31 For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”
32 Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him.
33 And when they came to the place which is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.
34 And Jesus said, “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” And they cast lots to divide his garments.
35 And the people stood by, watching; but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!”
36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar,
37 and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”
38 There was also an inscription over him, “This is the King of the Jews.”
39 One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!”
40 But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
41 And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.”
42 And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingly power.”
43 And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”
### The Death of Jesus
44 It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,
45 while the sun’s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
46 Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit!” And having said this he breathed his last.
47 Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, and said, “Certainly this man was innocent!”
48 And all the multitudes who assembled to see the sight, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts.
49 And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance and saw these things.
### The Burial of Jesus
50 Now there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimatheʹa. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man,
51 who had not consented to their purpose and deed, and he was looking for the kingdom of God.
52 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
53 Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud, and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb, where no one had ever yet been laid.
54 It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.
55 The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid;
56 then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.


# Evangelium Secundum Lucam 23 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et surgens omnis multitudo eorum, duxerunt illum ad Pilatum.
2 Cœperunt autem illum accusare, dicentes: Hunc invenimus subvertentem gentem nostram, et prohibentem tributa dare Cæsari, et dicentem se Christum regem esse.
3 Pilatus autem interrogavit eum, dicens: Tu es rex Judæorum? At ille respondens ait: Tu dicis.
4 Ait autem Pilatus ad principes sacerdotum et turbas: Nihil invenio causæ in hoc homine.
5 At illi invalescebant, dicentes: Commovet populum docens per universam Judæam, incipiens a Galilæa usque huc.
6 Pilatus autem audiens Galilæam, interrogavit si homo Galilæus esset.
7 Et ut cognovit quod de Herodis potestate esset, remisit eum ad Herodem, qui et ipse Jerosolymis erat illis diebus.
8 Herodes autem viso Jesu, gavisus est valde. Erat enim cupiens ex multo tempore videre eum, eo quod audierat multa de eo, et sperabat signum aliquod videre ab eo fieri.
9 Interrogabat autem eum multis sermonibus. At ipse nihil illi respondebat.
10 Stabant autem principes sacerdotum et scribæ constanter accusantes eum.
11 Sprevit autem illum Herodes cum exercitu suo: et illusit indutum veste alba, et remisit ad Pilatum.
12 Et facti sunt amici Herodes et Pilatus in ipsa die: nam antea inimici erant ad invicem.

13 Pilatus autem, convocatis principibus sacerdotum, et magistratibus, et plebe,
14 dixit ad illos: Obtulistis mihi hunc hominem, quasi avertentem populum, et ecce ego coram vobis interrogans, nullam causam inveni in homine isto ex his in quibus eum accusatis.
15 Sed neque Herodes: nam remisi vos ad illum, et ecce nihil dignum morte actum est ei.
16 Emendatum ergo illum dimittam.
17 Necesse autem habebat dimittere eis per diem festum unum.
18 Exclamavit autem simul universa turba, dicens: Tolle hunc, et dimitte nobis Barabbam:
19 qui erat propter seditionem quamdam factam in civitate et homicidium missus in carcerem.
20 Iterum autem Pilatus locutus est ad eos, volens dimittere Jesum.
21 At illi succlamabant, dicentes: Crucifige, crucifige eum.
22 Ille autem tertio dixit ad illos: Quid enim mali fecit iste? nullam causam mortis invenio in eo: corripiam ergo illum et dimittam.
23 At illi instabant vocibus magnis postulantes ut crucifigeretur: et invalescebant voces eorum.
24 Et Pilatus adjudicavit fieri petitionem eorum.
25 Dimisit autem illis eum qui propter homicidium et seditionem missus fuerat in carcerem, quem petebant: Jesum vero tradidit voluntati eorum.

26 Et cum ducerent eum, apprehenderunt Simonem quemdam Cyrenensem venientem de villa: et imposuerunt illi crucem portare post Jesum.
27 Sequebatur autem illum multa turba populi et mulierum, quæ plangebant et lamentabantur eum.
28 Conversus autem ad illas Jesus, dixit: Filiæ Jerusalem, nolite flere super me, sed super vos ipsas flete et super filios vestros.
29 Quoniam ecce venient dies in quibus dicent: Beatæ steriles, et ventres qui non genuerunt, et ubera quæ non lactaverunt.
30 Tunc incipient dicere montibus: Cadite super nos; et collibus: Operite nos.
31 Quia si in viridi ligno hæc faciunt, in arido quid fiet?
32 Ducebantur autem et alii duo nequam cum eo, ut interficerentur.
33 Et postquam venerunt in locum qui vocatur Calvariæ, ibi crucifixerunt eum: et latrones, unum a dextris, et alterum a sinistris.
34 Jesus autem dicebat: Pater, dimitte illis: non enim sciunt quid faciunt. Dividentes vero vestimenta ejus, miserunt sortes.

35 Et stabat populus spectans, et deridebant eum principes cum eis, dicentes: Alios salvos fecit, se salvum faciat, si hic est Christus Dei electus.
36 Illudebant autem ei et milites accedentes, et acetum offerentes ei,
37 et dicentes: Si tu es rex Judæorum, salvum te fac.
38 Erat autem et superscriptio scripta super eum litteris græcis, et latinis, et hebraicis: Hic est rex Judæorum.
39 Unus autem de his, qui pendebant, latronibus, blasphemabat eum, dicens: Si tu es Christus, salvum fac temetipsum et nos.
40 Respondens autem alter increpabat eum, dicens: Neque tu times Deum, quod in eadem damnatione es.
41 Et nos quidem juste, nam digna factis recipimus: hic vero nihil mali gessit.
42 Et dicebat ad Jesum: Domine, memento mei cum veneris in regnum tuum.
43 Et dixit illi Jesus: Amen dico tibi: hodie mecum eris in paradiso.

44 Erat autem fere hora sexta, et tenebræ factæ sunt in universam terram usque ad horam nonam.
45 Et obscuratus est sol, et velum templi scissum est medium.
46 Et clamans voce magna Jesus ait: Pater, in manus tuas commendo spiritum meum. Et hæc dicens, expiravit.
47 Videns autem centurio quod factum fuerat, glorificavit Deum, dicens: Vere hic homo justus erat.
48 Et omnis turba eorum, qui simul aderant ad spectaculum istud, et videbant quæ fiebant, percutientes pectora sua revertebantur.

49 Stabant autem omnes noti ejus a longe, et mulieres, quæ secutæ eum erant a Galilæa, hæc videntes.
50 Et ecce vir nomine Joseph, qui erat decurio, vir bonus et justus:
51 hic non consenserat consilio, et actibus eorum: ab Arimathæa civitate Judææ, qui exspectabat et ipse regnum Dei:
52 hic accessit ad Pilatum et petiit corpus Jesu:
53 et depositum involvit sindone, et posuit eum in monumento exciso, in quo nondum quisquam positus fuerat.
54 Et dies erat parasceves, et sabbatum illucescebat.
55 Subsecutæ autem mulieres, quæ cum eo venerant de Galilæa, viderunt monumentum, et quemadmodum positum erat corpus ejus.
56 Et revertentes paraverunt aromata, et unguenta: et sabbato quidem siluerunt secundum mandatum.


# Κατὰ Λουκᾶν 23 (Textus Receptus)

1 Καὶ ἀναστὰν ἅπαν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῶν ἤγαγον αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν Πιλᾶτον.
2 ἤρξαντο δὲ κατηγορεῖν αὐτοῦ λέγοντες: τοῦτον εὕραμεν διαστρέφοντα τὸ ἔθνος ἡμῶν καὶ κωλύοντα φόρους Καίσαρι διδόναι, καὶ λέγοντα ἑαυτὸν Χριστὸν βασιλέα εἶναι.
3 ὁ δὲ Πιλᾶτος ἠρώτησεν αὐτὸν λέγων: σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων; ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτῷ ἔφη: σὺ λέγεις.
4 ὁ δὲ Πιλᾶτος εἶπεν πρὸς τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ τοὺς ὄχλους: οὐδὲν εὑρίσκω αἴτιον ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ.
5 οἱ δὲ ἐπίσχυον λέγοντες ὅτι ἀνασείει τὸν λαὸν, διδάσκων καθ' ὅλης τῆς Ἰουδαίας καὶ ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ἕως ὧδε.
6 Πιλᾶτος δὲ ἀκούσας ἐπηρώτησεν εἰ ὁ ἄνθρωπος Γαλιλαῖός ἐστιν,
7 καὶ ἐπιγνοὺς ὅτι ἐκ τῆς ἐξουσίας Ἡρῴδου ἐστὶν, ἀνέπεμψεν αὐτὸν πρὸς Ἡρῴδην, ὄντα καὶ αὐτὸν ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις ἐν ταύταις ταῖς ἡμέραις.
8 ὁ δὲ Ἡρῴδης ἰδὼν τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐχάρη λίαν: ἦν γὰρ ἐξ ἱκανῶν χρόνων θέλων ἰδεῖν αὐτὸν διὰ τὸ ἀκούειν περὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἤλπιζέν τι σημεῖον ἰδεῖν ὑπ' αὐτοῦ γινόμενον.
9 ἐπηρώτα δὲ αὐτὸν ἐν λόγοις ἱκανοῖς: αὐτὸς δὲ οὐδὲν ἀπεκρίνατο αὐτῷ.
10 εἱστήκεισαν δὲ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς εὐτόνως κατηγοροῦντες αὐτοῦ.
11 ἐξουθενήσας δὲ αὐτὸν καὶ ὁ Ἡρῴδης σὺν τοῖς στρατεύμασιν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐμπαίξας περιβαλὼν ἐσθῆτα λαμπρὰν ἀνέπεμψεν αὐτὸν τῷ Πιλάτῳ.
12 ἐγένοντο δὲ φίλοι ὅ τε Ἡρῴδης καὶ ὁ Πιλᾶτος ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ μετ' ἀλλήλων: προϋπῆρχον γὰρ ἐν ἔχθρᾳ ὄντες πρὸς αὐτούς.

13 Πιλᾶτος δὲ συγκαλεσάμενος τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ τὸν λαὸν
14 εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς: προσηνέγκατέ μοι τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦτον ὡς ἀποστρέφοντα τὸν λαόν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ἀνακρίνας οὐθὲν εὗρον ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ αἴτιον ὧν κατηγορεῖτε κατ' αὐτοῦ,
15 ἀλλ' οὐδὲ Ἡρῴδης: ἀνέπεμψεν γὰρ αὐτὸν πρὸς ἡμᾶς: καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐδὲν ἄξιον θανάτου ἐστὶν πεπραγμένον αὐτῷ.
16 παιδεύσας οὖν αὐτὸν ἀπολύσω.
17 
18 ἀνέκραγον δὲ παμπληθεὶ λέγοντες: αἶρε τοῦτον, ἀπόλυσον δὲ ἡμῖν τὸν Βαραββᾶν:
19 ὅστις ἦν διὰ στάσιν τινὰ γενομένην ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ φόνον βληθεὶς ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ.
20 πάλιν δὲ ὁ Πιλᾶτος προσεφώνησεν, αὐτοῖς θέλων ἀπολῦσαι τὸν Ἰησοῦν.
21 οἱ δὲ ἐπεφώνουν λέγοντες: σταύρου, σταύρου αὐτόν.
22 ὁ δὲ τρίτον εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς: τί γὰρ κακὸν ἐποίησεν οὗτος; οὐδὲν αἴτιον θανάτου εὗρον ἐν αὐτῷ: παιδεύσας οὖν αὐτὸν ἀπολύσω.
23 οἱ δὲ ἐπέκειντο φωναῖς μεγάλαις αἰτούμενοι αὐτὸν σταυρωθῆναι, καὶ κατίσχυον αἱ φωναὶ αὐτῶν.
24 καὶ Πιλᾶτος ἐπέκρινεν γενέσθαι τὸ αἴτημα αὐτῶν:
25 ἀπέλυσεν δὲ τὸν διὰ στάσιν καὶ φόνον βεβλημένον εἰς φυλακὴν, ὃν ᾐτοῦντο, τὸν δὲ Ἰησοῦν παρέδωκεν τῷ θελήματι αὐτῶν.

26 Καὶ ὡς ἀπήγαγον αὐτόν, ἐπιλαβόμενοι Σίμωνά τινα Κυρηναῖον ἐρχόμενον ἀπ' ἀγροῦ ἐπέθηκαν αὐτῷ τὸν σταυρὸν φέρειν ὄπισθεν τοῦ Ἰησοῦ.
27 ἠκολούθει δὲ αὐτῷ πολὺ πλῆθος τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ γυναικῶν, αἳ ἐκόπτοντο καὶ ἐθρήνουν αὐτόν.
28 στραφεὶς δὲ πρὸς αὐτὰς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν: θυγατέρες Ἰερουσαλήμ μὴ κλαίετε ἐπ' ἐμέ: πλὴν ἐφ' ἑαυτὰς κλαίετε καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν,
29 ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἔρχονται ἡμέραι ἐν αἷς ἐροῦσιν: μακάριαι αἱ στεῖραι καὶ αἱ κοιλίαι αἳ οὐκ ἐγέννησαν, καὶ μαστοὶ οἳ οὐκ ἔθρεψαν.
30 τότε ἄρξονται λέγειν τοῖς ὄρεσιν: πέσετε ἐφ' ἡμᾶς, καὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς: καλύψατε ἡμᾶς:
31 ὅτι εἰ ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ξύλῳ ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν, ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ τί γένηται;
32 ἤγοντο δὲ καὶ ἕτεροι κακοῦργοι δύο σὺν αὐτῷ ἀναιρεθῆναι.
33 Καὶ ὅτε ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τὸν καλούμενον κρανίον, ἐκεῖ ἐσταύρωσαν αὐτὸν καὶ τοὺς κακούργους, ὃν μὲν ἐκ δεξιῶν, ὃν δὲ ἐξ ἀριστερῶν.
34 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς ἔλεγεν: πάτερ, ἄφες αὐτοῖς, οὐ γὰρ οἴδασιν τί ποιοῦσιν. διαμεριζόμενοι δὲ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ ἔβαλον κλήρους.

35 καὶ εἱστήκει ὁ λαὸς θεωρῶν. ἐξεμυκτήριζον δὲ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες λέγοντες: ἄλλους ἔσωσεν, σωσάτω ἑαυτόν, εἰ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστὸς τοῦ θεοῦ ὁ ἐκλεκτός.
36 ἐνέπαιξαν δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ οἱ στρατιῶται προσερχόμενοι, ὄξος προσφέροντες αὐτῷ
37 καὶ λέγοντες: εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων, σῶσον σεαυτόν.
38 ἦν δὲ καὶ ἐπιγραφὴ ἐπ' αὐτῷ: ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων οὗτος.
39 Εἷς δὲ τῶν κρεμασθέντων κακούργων ἐβλασφήμει αὐτὸν: λέγων οὐχὶ σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστός; σῶσον σεαυτὸν καὶ ἡμᾶς.
40 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ ἕτερος ἐπιτιμῶν αὐτῷ ἔφη: οὐδὲ φοβῇ σὺ τὸν θεόν, ὅτι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ κρίματι εἶ;
41 καὶ ἡμεῖς μὲν δικαίως, ἄξια γὰρ ὧν ἐπράξαμεν ἀπολαμβάνομεν: οὗτος δὲ οὐδὲν ἄτοπον ἔπραξεν.
42 καὶ ἔλεγεν: Ἰησοῦ, μνήσθητί μου ὅταν ἔλθῃς εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν σου.
43 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ: ἀμήν σοι λέγω, σήμερον μετ' ἐμοῦ ἔσῃ ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ.

44 Καὶ ἦν ἤδη ὡσεὶ ὥρα ἕκτη καὶ σκότος ἐγένετο ἐφ' ὅλην τὴν γῆν ἕως ὥρας ἐνάτης,
45 τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος: ἐσχίσθη δὲ τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ ναοῦ μέσον.
46 καὶ φωνήσας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν: πάτερ, εἰς χεῖράς σου παρατίθεμαι τὸ πνεῦμά μου. τοῦτο δὲ εἰπὼν ἐξέπνευσεν.
47 ἰδὼν δὲ ὁ ἑκατοντάρχης τὸ γενόμενον ἐδόξαζεν τὸν θεὸν λέγων: ὄντως ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗτος δίκαιος ἦν.
48 καὶ πάντες οἱ συμπαραγενόμενοι ὄχλοι ἐπὶ τὴν θεωρίαν ταύτην, θεωρήσαντες τὰ γενόμενα, τύπτοντες τὰ στήθη ὑπέστρεφον.

49 εἱστήκεισαν δὲ πάντες οἱ γνωστοὶ αὐτῷ ἀπὸ μακρόθεν, καὶ γυναῖκες αἱ συνακολουθοῦσαι αὐτῷ ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας, ὁρῶσαι ταῦτα.
50 Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ ὀνόματι Ἰωσὴφ βουλευτὴς ὑπάρχων, καὶ ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς καὶ δίκαιος
51 οὗτος οὐκ ἦν συγκατατεθειμένος τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῇ πράξει αὐτῶν, ἀπὸ Ἁριμαθαίας πόλεως τῶν Ἰουδαίων, ὃς προσεδέχετο τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ,
52 οὗτος προσελθὼν τῷ Πιλάτῳ ᾐτήσατο τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ,
53 καὶ καθελὼν ἐνετύλιξεν αὐτὸ σινδόνι, καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὸν ἐν μνήματι λαξευτῷ οὗ οὐκ ἦν οὐδεὶς οὔπω κείμενος.
54 καὶ ἡμέρα ἦν παρασκευῆς, καὶ σάββατον ἐπέφωσκεν.
55 Κατακολουθήσασαι δὲ αἱ γυναῖκες, αἵτινες ἦσαν συνεληλυθυῖαι ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας αὐτῷ, ἐθεάσαντο τὸ μνημεῖον καὶ ὡς ἐτέθη τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ,
56 ὑποστρέψασαι δὲ ἡτοίμασαν ἀρώματα καὶ μύρα: καὶ τὸ μὲν σάββατον ἡσύχασαν κατὰ τὴν ἐντολήν.
