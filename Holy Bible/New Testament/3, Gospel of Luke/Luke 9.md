# Gospel According to Saint Luke 9 (RSVCE)

### The Mission of the Twelve
1 And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases,
2 and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal.
3 And he said to them, “Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.
4 And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.
5 And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.”
6 And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.
### Herod’s Perplexity
7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,
8 by some that Eliʹjah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen.
9 Herod said, “John I beheaded; but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And he sought to see him.
### Feeding the Five Thousand
10 On their return the apostles told him what they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a city called Beth-saʹida.
11 When the crowds learned it, they followed him; and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and cured those who had need of healing.
12 Now the day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, “Send the crowd away, to go into the villages and country round about, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a lonely place.”
13 But he said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish—unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.”
14 For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, “Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.”
15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.
16 And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
17 And all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over, twelve baskets of broken pieces.
### Peter’s Declaration about Jesus
18 Now it happened that as he was praying alone the disciples were with him; and he asked them, “Who do the people say that I am?”
19 And they answered, “John the Baptist; but others say, Eliʹjah; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen.”
20 And he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”
21 But he charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,
22 saying, “The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.”
23 And he said to all, “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
24 For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it.
25 For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?
26 For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
27 But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.”
### The Transfiguration
28 Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.
29 And as he was praying, the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became dazzling white.
30 And behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Eliʹjah,
31 who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem.
32 Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep but kept awake, and they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.
33 And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is well that we are here; let us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Eliʹjah”—not knowing what he said.
34 As he said this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
35 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!”
36 And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silence and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.
### Jesus Heals a Boy with a Demon
37 On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.
38 And behold, a man from the crowd cried, “Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child;
39 and behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him till he foams, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him.
40 And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.”
41 Jesus answered, “O faithless and perverse generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”
42 While he was coming, the demon tore him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
### Jesus Again Foretells His Death
43 And all were astonished at the majesty of God. But while they were all marveling at everything he did, he said to his disciples,
44 “Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men.”
45 But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
### True Greatness
46 And an argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.
47 But when Jesus perceived the thought of their hearts, he took a child and put him by his side,
48 and said to them, “Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me; for he who is least among you all is the one who is great.”
### Another Exorcist
49 John answered, “Master, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.”
50 But Jesus said to him, “Do not forbid him; for he that is not against you is for you.”
### A Samaritan Village Refuses to Receive Jesus
51 When the days drew near for him to be received up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.
52 And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him;
53 but the people would not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem.
54 And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, “Lord, do you want us to bid fire come down from heaven and consume them?”
55 But he turned and rebuked them.
56 And they went on to another village.
### Would-Be Followers of Jesus
57 As they were going along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”
58 And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.”
59 To another he said, “Follow me.” But he said, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”
60 But he said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”
61 Another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but let me first say farewell to those at my home.”
62 Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”


# Evangelium Secundum Lucam 9 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Convocatis autem duodecim Apostolis, dedit illis virtutem et potestatem super omnia dæmonia, et ut languores curarent.
2 Et misit illos prædicare regnum Dei, et sanare infirmos.
3 Et ait ad illos: Nihil tuleritis in via, neque virgam, neque peram, neque panem, neque pecuniam, neque duas tunicas habeatis.
4 Et in quamcumque domum intraveritis, ibi manete, et inde ne exeatis.
5 Et quicumque non receperint vos: exeuntes de civitate illa, etiam pulverem pedum vestrorum excutite in testimonium supra illos.
6 Egressi autem circuibant per castella evangelizantes, et curantes ubique.

7 Audivit autem Herodes tetrarcha omnia quæ fiebant ab eo, et hæsitabat eo quod diceretur
8 a quibusdam: Quia Joannes surrexit a mortuis: a quibusdam vero: Quia Elias apparuit: ab aliis autem: Quia propheta unus de antiquis surrexit.
9 Et ait Herodes: Joannem ego decollavi: quis est autem iste, de quo ego talia audio? Et quærebat videre eum.

10 Et reversi Apostoli, narraverunt illi quæcumque fecerunt: et assumptis illis secessit seorsum in locum desertum, qui est Bethsaidæ.
11 Quod cum cognovissent turbæ, secutæ sunt illum: et excepit eos, et loquebatur illis de regno Dei, et eos, qui cura indigebant, sanabat.
12 Dies autem cœperat declinare, et accedentes duodecim dixerunt illi: Dimitte turbas, ut euntes in castella villasque quæ circa sunt, divertant, et inveniant escas: quia hic in loco deserto sumus.
13 Ait autem ad illos: Vos date illis manducare. At illi dixerunt: Non sunt nobis plus quam quinque panes et duo pisces: nisi forte nos eamus, et emamus in omnem hanc turbam escas.
14 Erant autem fere viri quinque millia. Ait autem ad discipulos suos: Facite illos discumbere per convivia quinquagenos.
15 Et ita fecerunt: et discumbere fecerunt omnes.
16 Acceptis autem quinque panibus et duobus piscibus, respexit in cælum, et benedixit illis: et fregit, et distribuit discipulis suis, ut ponerent ante turbas.
17 Et manducaverunt omnes, et saturati sunt. Et sublatum est quod superfuit illis, fragmentorum cophini duodecim.

18 Et factum est cum solus esset orans, erant cum illo et discipuli: et interrogavit illos, dicens: Quem me dicunt esse turbæ?
19 At illi responderunt, et dixerunt: Joannem Baptistam, alii autem Eliam, alii vero quia unus propheta de prioribus surrexit.
20 Dixit autem illis: Vos autem quem me esse dicitis? Respondens Simon Petrus, dixit: Christum Dei.
21 At ille increpans illos, præcepit ne cui dicerent hoc,
22 dicens: Quia oportet Filium hominis multa pati, et reprobari a senioribus, et principibus sacerdotum, et scribis, et occidi, et tertia die resurgere.
23 Dicebat autem ad omnes: Si quis vult post me venire, abneget semetipsum, et tollat crucem suam quotidie, et sequatur me.
24 Qui enim voluerit animam suam salvam facere, perdet illam: nam qui perdiderit animam suam propter me, salvam faciet illam.
25 Quid enim proficit homo, si lucretur universum mundum, se autem ipsum perdat, et detrimentum sui faciat?
26 Nam qui me erubuerit, et meos sermones: hunc Filius hominis erubescet cum venerit in majestate sua, et Patris, et sanctorum angelorum.
27 Dico autem vobis vere: sunt aliqui hic stantes, qui non gustabunt mortem donec videant regnum Dei.

28 Factum est autem post hæc verba fere dies octo, et assumpsit Petrum, et Jacobum, et Joannem, et ascendit in montem ut oraret.
29 Et facta est, dum oraret, species vultus ejus altera: et vestitus ejus albus et refulgens.
30 Et ecce duo viri loquebantur cum illo. Erant autem Moyses et Elias,
31 visi in majestate: et dicebant excessum ejus, quem completurus erat in Jerusalem.
32 Petrus vero, et qui cum illo erant, gravati erant somno. Et evigilantes viderunt majestatem ejus, et duos viros qui stabant cum illo.
33 Et factum est cum discederent ab illo, ait Petrus ad Jesum: Præceptor, bonum est nos hic esse: et faciamus tria tabernacula, unum tibi, et unum Moysi, et unum Eliæ: nesciens quid diceret.
34 Hæc autem illo loquente, facta est nubes, et obumbravit eos: et timuerunt, intrantibus illis in nubem.
35 Et vox facta est de nube, dicens: Hic est Filius meus dilectus, ipsum audite.
36 Et dum fieret vox, inventus est Jesus solus. Et ipsi tacuerunt, et nemini dixerunt in illis diebus quidquam ex his quæ viderant.

37 Factum est autem in sequenti die, descendentibus illis de monte, occurrit illis turba multa.
38 Et ecce vir de turba exclamavit, dicens: Magister, obsecro te, respice in filium meum quia unicus est mihi:
39 et ecce spiritus apprehendit eum, et subito clamat, et elidit, et dissipat eum cum spuma, et vix discedit dilanians eum:
40 et rogavi discipulos tuos ut ejicerent illum, et non potuerunt.
41 Respondens autem Jesus, dixit: O generatio infidelis, et perversa, usquequo ero apud vos, et patiar vos? adduc huc filium tuum.
42 Et cum accederet, elisit illum dæmonium, et dissipavit.
43 Et increpavit Jesus spiritum immundum, et sanavit puerum, et reddidit illum patri ejus.
44 Stupebant autem omnes in magnitudine Dei: omnibusque mirantibus in omnibus quæ faciebat, dixit ad discipulos suos: Ponite vos in cordibus vestris sermones istos: Filius enim hominis futurum est ut tradatur in manus hominum.
45 At illi ignorabant verbum istud, et erat velatum ante eos ut non sentirent illud: et timebant eum interrogare de hoc verbo.

46 Intravit autem cogitatio in eos quis eorum major esset.
47 At Jesus videns cogitationes cordis illorum, apprehendit puerum, et statuit illum secus se,
48 et ait illis: Quicumque susceperit puerum istum in nomine meo, me recipit: et quicumque me receperit, recipit eum qui me misit. Nam qui minor est inter vos omnes, hic major est.
49 Respondens autem Joannes dixit: Præceptor, vidimus quemdam in nomine tuo ejicientem dæmonia, et prohibuimus eum: quia non sequitur nobiscum.
50 Et ait ad illum Jesus: Nolite prohibere: qui enim non est adversum vos, pro vobis est.

51 Factum est autem dum complerentur dies assumptionis ejus, et ipse faciem suam firmavit ut iret in Jerusalem.
52 Et misit nuntios ante conspectum suum: et euntes intraverunt in civitatem Samaritanorum ut parerent illi.
53 Et non receperunt eum, quia facies ejus erat euntis in Jerusalem.
54 Cum vidissent autem discipuli ejus Jacobus et Joannes, dixerunt: Domine, vis dicimus ut ignis descendat de cælo, et consumat illos?
55 Et conversus increpavit illos, dicens: Nescitis cujus spiritus estis.
56 Filius hominis non venit animas perdere, sed salvare. Et abierunt in aliud castellum.

57 Factum est autem: ambulantibus illis in via, dixit quidam ad illum: Sequar te quocumque ieris.
58 Dixit illi Jesus: Vulpes foveas habent, et volucres cæli nidos: Filius autem hominis non habet ubi caput reclinet.
59 Ait autem ad alterum: Sequere me: ille autem dixit: Domine, permitte mihi primum ire, et sepelire patrem meum.
60 Dixitque ei Jesus: Sine ut mortui sepeliant mortuos suos: tu autem vade, et annuntia regnum Dei.
61 Et ait alter: Sequar te Domine, sed permitte mihi primum renuntiare his quæ domi sunt.
62 Ait ad illum Jesus: Nemo mittens manum suam ad aratrum, et respiciens retro, aptus est regno Dei.


# Κατὰ Λουκᾶν 9 (Textus Receptus)

1 Συγκαλεσάμενος δὲ τοὺς δώδεκα ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς δύναμιν καὶ ἐξουσίαν ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ δαιμόνια καὶ νόσους θεραπεύειν,
2 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς κηρύσσειν τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἰᾶσθαι, τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς
3 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς: μηδὲν αἴρετε εἰς τὴν ὁδόν, μήτε ῥάβδον μήτε πήραν μήτε ἄρτον μήτε ἀργύριον, μήτε ἀνὰ δύο χιτῶνας ἔχειν.
4 καὶ εἰς ἣν ἂν οἰκίαν εἰσέλθητε, ἐκεῖ μένετε καὶ ἐκεῖθεν ἐξέρχεσθε.
5 καὶ ὅσοι ἂν μὴ δέχωνται ὑμᾶς, ἐξερχόμενοι ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ἐκείνης τὸν κονιορτὸν ἀπὸ τῶν ποδῶν ὑμῶν ἀποτινάσσετε εἰς μαρτύριον ἐπ' αὐτούς.
6 ἐξερχόμενοι δὲ διήρχοντο κατὰ τὰς κώμας εὐαγγελιζόμενοι καὶ θεραπεύοντες πανταχοῦ.

7 Ἤκουσεν δὲ Ἡρῴδης ὁ τετραάρχης τὰ γινόμενα πάντα, καὶ διηπόρει διὰ τὸ λέγεσθαι ὑπό τινων ὅτι Ἰωάννης ἠγέρθη ἐκ νεκρῶν,
8 ὑπό τινων δὲ ὅτι Ἠλίας ἐφάνη, ἄλλων δὲ ὅτι προφήτης τις τῶν ἀρχαίων ἀνέστη.
9 εἶπεν δὲ Ἡρῴδης: Ἰωάννην ἐγὼ ἀπεκεφάλισα: τίς δέ ἐστιν οὗτος περὶ οὗ ἀκούω τοιαῦτα; καὶ ἐζήτει ἰδεῖν αὐτόν.

10 Καὶ ὑποστρέψαντες οἱ ἀπόστολοι διηγήσαντο αὐτῷ ὅσα ἐποίησαν. καὶ παραλαβὼν αὐτοὺς ὑπεχώρησεν κατ' ἰδίαν εἰς πόλιν καλουμένην Βηθσαϊδά.
11 οἱ δὲ ὄχλοι γνόντες ἠκολούθησαν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀποδεξάμενος αὐτοὺς ἐλάλει αὐτοῖς περὶ τῆς βασιλείας τοῦ θεοῦ, καὶ τοὺς χρείαν ἔχοντας θεραπείας ἰᾶτο.
12 ἡ δὲ ἡμέρα ἤρξατο κλίνειν: προσελθόντες δὲ οἱ δώδεκα εἶπαν αὐτῷ: ἀπόλυσον τὸν ὄχλον, ἵνα πορευθέντες εἰς τὰς κύκλῳ κώμας καὶ ἀγροὺς καταλύσωσιν καὶ εὕρωσιν ἐπισιτισμόν, ὅτι ὧδε ἐν ἐρήμῳ τόπῳ ἐσμέν.
13 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτούς: δότε αὐτοῖς ὑμεῖς φαγεῖν οἱ δὲ εἶπαν. οὐκ εἰσὶν ἡμῖν πλεῖον ἢ ἄρτοι πέντε καὶ ἰχθύες δύο, εἰ μήτι πορευθέντες ἡμεῖς ἀγοράσωμεν εἰς πάντα τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον βρώματα.
14 ἦσαν γὰρ ὡσεὶ ἄνδρες πεντακισχίλιοι. εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ: κατακλίνατε αὐτοὺς κλισίας ὡσεὶ ἀνὰ πεντήκοντα.
15 καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως καὶ κατέκλιναν ἅπαντας.
16 λαβὼν δὲ τοὺς πέντε ἄρτους καὶ τοὺς δύο ἰχθύας, ἀναβλέψας εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν εὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς καὶ κατέκλασεν, καὶ ἐδίδου τοῖς μαθηταῖς παραθεῖναι τῷ ὄχλῳ.
17 καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἐχορτάσθησαν πάντες, καὶ ἤρθη τὸ περισσεῦσαν αὐτοῖς κλασμάτων, κόφινοι δώδεκα.

18 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ εἶναι αὐτὸν προσευχόμενον κατὰ μόνας συνῆσαν αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταί, καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτοὺς λέγων: τίνα με λέγουσιν οἱ ὄχλοι εἶναι;
19 οἱ δὲ ἀποκριθέντες εἶπαν: Ἰωάννην τὸν βαπτιστήν, ἄλλοι δὲ Ἠλίαν, ἄλλοι δὲ ὅτι προφήτης τις τῶν ἀρχαίων ἀνέστη.
20 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς: ὑμεῖς δὲ τίνα με λέγετε εἶναι; Πέτρος δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν: τὸν Χριστὸν τοῦ θεοῦ.
21 ὁ δὲ ἐπιτιμήσας αὐτοῖς παρήγγειλεν μηδενὶ λέγειν τοῦτο,
22 εἰπὼν ὅτι δεῖ τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου πολλὰ παθεῖν καὶ ἀποδοκιμασθῆναι ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων καὶ ἀρχιερέων καὶ γραμματέων καὶ ἀποκτανθῆναι καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἐγερθῆναι.
23 Ἔλεγεν δὲ πρὸς πάντας: εἴ τις θέλει ὀπίσω μου ἔρχεσθαι, ἀρνησάσθω ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἀράτω τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ καθ' ἡμέραν, καὶ ἀκολουθείτω μοι.
24 ὃς γὰρ ἂν θέλῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ σῶσαι, ἀπολέσει αὐτήν: ὃς δ' ἂν ἀπολέσῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ, οὗτος σώσει αὐτήν.
25 τί γὰρ ὠφελεῖται ἄνθρωπος κερδήσας τὸν κόσμον ὅλον, ἑαυτὸν δὲ ἀπολέσας ἢ ζημιωθείς;
26 ὃς γὰρ ἂν ἐπαισχυνθῇ με καὶ τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους, τοῦτον ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐπαισχυνθήσεται, ὅταν ἔλθῃ ἐν τῇ δόξῃ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ τῶν ἁγίων ἀγγέλων.
27 λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν ἀληθῶς, εἰσίν τινες τῶν αὐτοῦ ἑστηκότων οἳ οὐ μὴ γεύσωνται θανάτου ἕως ἂν ἴδωσιν τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ.

28 Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους, ὡσεὶ ἡμέραι ὀκτὼ, καὶ παραλαβὼν Πέτρον καὶ Ἰωάννην καὶ Ἰάκωβον ἀνέβη εἰς τὸ ὄρος προσεύξασθαι.
29 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ προσεύχεσθαι αὐτὸν τὸ εἶδος τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἕτερον καὶ ὁ ἱματισμὸς αὐτοῦ λευκὸς ἐξαστράπτων.
30 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄνδρες δύο συνελάλουν αὐτῷ, οἵτινες ἦσαν Μωϋσῆς καὶ Ἠλίας,
31 οἳ ὀφθέντες ἐν δόξῃ ἔλεγον τὴν ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ, ἣν ἤμελλεν πληροῦν ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ
32 ὁ δὲ Πέτρος καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ ἦσαν βεβαρημένοι ὕπνῳ: διαγρηγορήσαντες δὲ εἶδον τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς δύο ἄνδρας τοὺς συνεστῶτας αὐτῷ.
33 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ διαχωρίζεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἀπ' αὐτοῦ εἶπεν ὁ Πέτρος πρὸς τὸν Ἰησοῦν: ἐπιστάτα, καλόν ἐστιν ἡμᾶς ὧδε εἶναι, καὶ ποιήσωμεν σκηνὰς τρεῖς, μίαν σοὶ καὶ μίαν Μωϋσεῖ καὶ μίαν Ἠλίᾳ, μὴ εἰδὼς ὃ λέγει.
34 ταῦτα δὲ αὐτοῦ λέγοντος ἐγένετο νεφέλη καὶ ἐπεσκίαζεν αὐτούς: ἐφοβήθησαν δὲ ἐν τῷ εἰσελθεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν νεφέλην.
35 καὶ φωνὴ ἐγένετο ἐκ τῆς νεφέλης λέγουσα: οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἐκλελεγμένος, αὐτοῦ ἀκούετε.
36 καὶ ἐν τῷ γενέσθαι τὴν φωνὴν εὑρέθη Ἰησοῦς μόνος. καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐσίγησαν καὶ οὐδενὶ ἀπήγγειλαν ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις οὐδὲν ὧν ἑώρακαν.

37 Ἐγένετο δὲ τῇ ἑξῆς ἡμέρᾳ κατελθόντων αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους συνήντησεν αὐτῷ ὄχλος πολύς.
38 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου ἐβόησεν λέγων: διδάσκαλε, δέομαί σου ἐπιβλέψαι ἐπὶ τὸν υἱόν μου, ὅτι μονογενής μοί ἐστιν,
39 καὶ ἰδοὺ πνεῦμα λαμβάνει αὐτόν καὶ ἐξαίφνης κράζει καὶ σπαράσσει αὐτὸν μετὰ ἀφροῦ, καὶ μόγις ἀποχωρεῖ ἀπ' αὐτοῦ συντρῖβον αὐτόν.
40 καὶ ἐδεήθην τῶν μαθητῶν σου ἵνα ἐκβάλωσιν αὐτό, καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν.
41 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν: ὦ γενεὰ ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη, ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν; προσάγαγε ὧδε τὸν υἱόν σου.
42 ἔτι δὲ προσερχομένου αὐτοῦ ἔρρηξεν αὐτὸν τὸ δαιμόνιον καὶ συνεσπάραξεν: ἐπετίμησεν δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς τῷ πνεύματι τῷ ἀκαθάρτῳ, καὶ ἰάσατο τὸν παῖδα καὶ ἀπέδωκεν αὐτὸν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ.
43 ἐξεπλήσσοντο δὲ πάντες ἐπὶ τῇ μεγαλειότητι τοῦ θεοῦ. Πάντων δὲ θαυμαζόντων ἐπὶ πᾶσιν οἷς ἐποίει, εἶπεν πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ:
44 θέσθε ὑμεῖς εἰς τὰ ὦτα ὑμῶν τοὺς λόγους τούτους: ὁ γὰρ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου μέλλει παραδίδοσθαι εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων.
45 οἱ δὲ ἠγνόουν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, καὶ ἦν παρακεκαλυμμένον ἀπ' αὐτῶν ἵνα μὴ αἴσθωνται αὐτό, καὶ ἐφοβοῦντο ἐρωτῆσαι αὐτὸν περὶ τοῦ ῥήματος τούτου.

46 Εἰσῆλθεν δὲ διαλογισμὸς ἐν αὐτοῖς, τὸ τίς ἂν εἴη μείζων αὐτῶν.
47 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἰδὼς τὸν διαλογισμὸν τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν, ἐπιλαβόμενος παιδίον ἔστησεν αὐτὸ παρ' ἑαυτῷ,
48 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: ὃς ἐὰν δέξηται τοῦτο τὸ παιδίον ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου, ἐμὲ δέχεται: καὶ ὃς ἂν ἐμὲ δέξηται, δέχεται τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με: ὁ γὰρ μικρότερος ἐν πᾶσιν ὑμῖν ὑπάρχων οὗτός ἐστιν μέγας.
49 Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ἰωάννης εἶπεν: ἐπιστάτα, εἴδομέν τινα ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου ἐκβάλλοντα δαιμόνια, καὶ ἐκωλύομεν αὐτὸν, ὅτι οὐκ ἀκολουθεῖ μεθ' ἡμῶν.
50 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς: μὴ κωλύετε: ὃς γὰρ οὐκ ἔστιν καθ' ὑμῶν, ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐστιν.

51 Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ συμπληροῦσθαι τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ἀναλήμψεως αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς τὸ πρόσωπον ἐστήρισεν τοῦ πορεύεσθαι εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ
52 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ. καὶ πορευθέντες εἰσῆλθον εἰς κώμην Σαμαριτῶν, ὡς ἑτοιμάσαι αὐτῷ:
53 καὶ οὐκ ἐδέξαντο αὐτόν, ὅτι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἦν πορευόμενον εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ
54 ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ μαθηταὶ Ἰάκωβος καὶ Ἰωάννης εἶπαν: κύριε, θέλεις εἴπωμεν πῦρ καταβῆναι ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἀναλῶσαι αὐτούς;
55 στραφεὶς δὲ ἐπετίμησεν αὐτοῖς.
56 καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς ἑτέραν κώμην.

57 Καὶ πορευομένων αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ εἶπέν τις πρὸς αὐτόν, ἀκολουθήσω σοι ὅπου ἐὰν ἀπέρχῃ.
58 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς: αἱ ἀλώπεκες φωλεοὺς ἔχουσιν καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατασκηνώσεις, ὁ δὲ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ.
59 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς ἕτερον: ἀκολούθει μοι. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν: κύριε ἐπίτρεψόν μοι ἀπελθόντι πρῶτον θάψαι τὸν πατέρα μου.
60 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ: ἄφες τοὺς νεκροὺς θάψαι τοὺς ἑαυτῶν νεκρούς, σὺ δὲ ἀπελθὼν διάγγελλε τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ.
61 εἶπεν δὲ καὶ ἕτερος: ἀκολουθήσω σοι, κύριε: πρῶτον δὲ ἐπίτρεψόν μοι ἀποτάξασθαι τοῖς εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου.
62 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς: οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα ἐπ' ἄροτρον καὶ βλέπων εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω εὔθετός ἐστιν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ.
