# Gospel According to Saint Luke 22 (RSVCE)

### The Plot to Kill Jesus
1 Now the feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover.
2 And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death; for they feared the people.
3 Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve;
4 he went away and conferred with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him to them.
5 And they were glad, and engaged to give him money.
6 So he agreed, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.
### The Preparation of the Passover
7 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
8 So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat it.”
9 They said to him, “Where will you have us prepare it?”
10 He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters,
11 and tell the householder, ‘The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?’
12 And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.”
13 And they went, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover.
### The Institution of the Lord’s Supper
14 And when the hour came, he sat at table, and the apostles with him.
15 And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer;
16 for I tell you I shall not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”
17 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, “Take this, and divide it among yourselves;
18 for I tell you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”
19 And he took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”
20 And likewise the cup after supper, saying, “This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.
21 But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.
22 For the Son of man goes as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!”
23 And they began to question one another, which of them it was that would do this.
### The Dispute about Greatness
24 A dispute also arose among them, which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.
25 And he said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors.
26 But not so with you; rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.
27 For which is the greater, one who sits at table, or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at table? But I am among you as one who serves.
28 “You are those who have continued with me in my trials;
29 as my Father appointed a kingdom for me, so do I appoint for you
30 that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
### Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial
31 “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat,
32 but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren.”
33 And he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.”
34 He said, “I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you three times deny that you know me.”
### Purse, Bag, and Sword
35 And he said to them, “When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “Nothing.”
36 He said to them, “But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag. And let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy one.
37 For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, ‘And he was reckoned with transgressors’; for what is written about me has its fulfilment.”
38 And they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” And he said to them, “It is enough.”
### Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives
39 And he came out, and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him.
40 And when he came to the place he said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.”
41 And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and prayed,
42 “Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.”
43 And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.
45 And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow,
46 and he said to them, “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”
### The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus
47 While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him;
48 but Jesus said to him, “Judas, would you betray the Son of man with a kiss?”
49 And when those who were about him saw what would follow, they said, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”
50 And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
51 But Jesus said, “No more of this!” And he touched his ear and healed him.
52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
53 When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”
### Peter Denies Jesus
54 Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest’s house. Peter followed at a distance;
55 and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.
56 Then a maid, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him, said, “This man also was with him.”
57 But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.”
58 And a little later some one else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”
59 And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, “Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.”
60 But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are saying.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed.
61 And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.”
62 And he went out and wept bitterly.
### The Mocking and Beating of Jesus
63 Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him;
64 they also blindfolded him and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?”
65 And they spoke many other words against him, reviling him.
### Jesus before the Council
66 When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council, and they said,
67 “If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe;
68 and if I ask you, you will not answer.
69 But from now on the Son of man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”
70 And they all said, “Are you the Son of God, then?” And he said to them, “You say that I am.”
71 And they said, “What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.”


# Evangelium Secundum Lucam 22 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Appropinquabat autem dies festus azymorum, qui dicitur Pascha:
2 et quærebant principes sacerdotum, et scribæ, quomodo Jesum interficerent: timebant vero plebem.
3 Intravit autem Satanas in Judam, qui cognominabatur Iscariotes, unum de duodecim:
4 et abiit, et locutus est cum principibus sacerdotum, et magistratibus, quemadmodum illum traderet eis.
5 Et gavisi sunt, et pacti sunt pecuniam illi dare.
6 Et spopondit, et quærebat opportunitatem ut traderet illum sine turbis.

7 Venit autem dies azymorum, in qua necesse erat occidi pascha.
8 Et misit Petrum et Joannem, dicens: Euntes parate nobis pascha, ut manducemus.
9 At illi dixerunt: Ubi vis paremus?
10 Et dixit ad eos: Ecce introëuntibus vobis in civitatem occurret vobis homo quidam amphoram aquæ portans: sequimini eum in domum, in quam intrat,
11 et dicetis patrifamilias domus: Dicit tibi Magister: Ubi est diversorium, ubi pascha cum discipulis meis manducem?
12 Et ipse ostendet vobis cœnaculum magnum stratum, et ibi parate.
13 Euntes autem invenerunt sicut dixit illis, et paraverunt pascha.
14 Et cum facta esset hora, discubuit, et duodecim apostoli cum eo.

15 Et ait illis: Desiderio desideravi hoc pascha manducare vobiscum, antequam patiar.
16 Dico enim vobis, quia ex hoc non manducabo illud, donec impleatur in regno Dei.
17 Et accepto calice gratias egit, et dixit: Accipite, et dividite inter vos.
18 Dico enim vobis quod non bibam de generatione vitis donec regnum Dei veniat.
19 Et accepto pane gratias egit, et fregit, et dedit eis, dicens: Hoc est corpus meum, quod pro vobis datur: hoc facite in meam commemorationem.
20 Similiter et calicem, postquam cœnavit, dicens: Hic est calix novum testamentum in sanguine meo, qui pro vobis fundetur.
21 Verumtamen ecce manus tradentis me, mecum est in mensa.
22 Et quidem Filius hominis, secundum quod definitum est, vadit: verumtamen væ homini illi per quem tradetur.
23 Et ipsi cœperunt quærere inter se quis esset ex eis qui hoc facturus esset.

24 Facta est autem et contentio inter eos, quis eorum videretur esse major.
25 Dixit autem eis: Reges gentium dominantur eorum: et qui potestatem habent super eos, benefici vocantur.
26 Vos autem non sic: sed qui major est in vobis, fiat sicut minor: et qui præcessor est, sicut ministrator.
27 Nam quis major est, qui recumbit, an qui ministrat? nonne qui recumbit? Ego autem in medio vestrum sum, sicut qui ministrat:

28 vos autem estis, qui permansistis mecum in tentationibus meis.
29 Et ego dispono vobis sicut disposuit mihi Pater meus regnum,
30 ut edatis et bibatis super mensam meam in regno meo, et sedeatis super thronos judicantes duodecim tribus Israël.
31 Ait autem Dominus: Simon, Simon, ecce Satanas expetivit vos ut cribraret sicut triticum:
32 ego autem rogavi pro te ut non deficiat fides tua: et tu aliquando conversus, confirma fratres tuos.
33 Qui dixit ei: Domine, tecum paratus sum et in carcerem et in mortem ire.
34 At ille dixit: Dico tibi, Petre, non cantabit hodie gallus, donec ter abneges nosse me. Et dixit eis:
35 Quando misi vos sine sacculo, et pera, et calceamentis, numquid aliquid defuit vobis?
36 At illi dixerunt: Nihil. Dixit ergo eis: Sed nunc qui habet sacculum, tollat; similiter et peram: et qui non habet, vendat tunicam suam et emat gladium.
37 Dico enim vobis, quoniam adhuc hoc quod scriptum est, oportet impleri in me: Et cum iniquis deputatus est. Etenim ea quæ sunt de me finem habent.
38 At illi dixerunt: Domine, ecce duo gladii hic. At ille dixit eis: Satis est.

39 Et egressus ibat secundum consuetudinem in monte Olivarum. Secuti sunt autem illum et discipuli.
40 Et cum pervenisset ad locum, dixit illis: Orate ne intretis in tentationem.
41 Et ipse avulsus est ab eis quantum jactus est lapidis: et positis genibus orabat,
42 dicens: Pater, si vis, transfer calicem istum a me: verumtamen non mea voluntas, sed tua fiat.
43 Apparuit autem illi angelus de cælo, confortans eum. Et factus in agonia, prolixius orabat.
44 Et factus est sudor ejus sicut guttæ sanguinis decurrentis in terram.
45 Et cum surrexisset ab oratione et venisset ad discipulos suos, invenit eos dormientes præ tristitia.
46 Et ait illis: Quid dormitis? surgite, orate, ne intretis in tentationem.

47 Adhuc eo loquente, ecce turba: et qui vocabatur Judas, unus de duodecim, antecedebat eos, et appropinquavit Jesu ut oscularetur eum.
48 Jesus autem dixit illi: Juda, osculo Filium hominis tradis?
49 Videntes autem hi qui circa ipsum erant, quod futurum erat, dixerunt ei: Domine, si percutimus in gladio?
50 Et percussit unus ex illis servum principis sacerdotum, et amputavit auriculam ejus dexteram.
51 Respondens autem Jesus, ait: Sinite usque huc. Et cum tetigisset auriculam ejus, sanavit eum.
52 Dixit autem Jesus ad eos qui venerant ad se principes sacerdotum, et magistratus templi, et seniores: Quasi ad latronem existis cum gladiis et fustibus?
53 Cum quotidie vobiscum fuerim in templo, non extendistis manus in me: sed hæc est hora vestra, et potestas tenebrarum.

54 Comprehendentes autem eum, duxerunt ad domum principis sacerdotum: Petrus vero sequebatur a longe.
55 Accenso autem igne in medio atrii et circumsedentibus illis, erat Petrus in medio eorum.
56 Quem cum vidisset ancilla quædam sedentem ad lumen, et eum fuisset intuita, dixit: Et hic cum illo erat.
57 At ille negavit eum, dicens: Mulier, non novi illum.
58 Et post pusillum alius videns eum, dixit: Et tu de illis es. Petrus vero ait: O homo, non sum.
59 Et intervallo facto quasi horæ unius, alius quidam affirmabat, dicens: Vere et hic cum illo erat: nam et Galilæus est.
60 Et ait Petrus: Homo, nescio quid dicis. Et continuo, adhuc illo loquente, cantavit gallus.
61 Et conversus Dominus respexit Petrum, et recordatus est Petrus verbi Domini, sicut dixerat: Quia priusquam gallus cantet, ter me negabis.
62 Et egressus foras Petrus flevit amare.

63 Et viri qui tenebant illum, illudebant ei, cædentes.
64 Et velaverunt eum, et percutiebant faciem ejus: et interrogabant eum, dicentes: Prophetiza, quis est, qui te percussit?
65 Et alia multa blasphemantes dicebant in eum.
66 Et ut factus est dies, convenerunt seniores plebis, et principes sacerdotum, et scribæ, et duxerunt illum in concilium suum, dicentes: Si tu es Christus, dic nobis.
67 Et ait illis: Si vobis dixero, non credetis mihi:
68 si autem et interrogavero, non respondebitis mihi, neque dimittetis.
69 Ex hoc autem erit Filius hominis sedens a dextris virtutis Dei.
70 Dixerunt autem omnes: Tu ergo es Filius Dei? Qui ait: Vos dicitis, quia ego sum.
71 At illi dixerunt: Quid adhuc desideramus testimonium? ipsi enim audivimus de ore ejus.


# Κατὰ Λουκᾶν 22 (Textus Receptus)

1 Ἤγγιζεν δὲ ἡ ἑορτὴ τῶν ἀζύμων ἡ λεγομένη πάσχα,
2 καὶ ἐζήτουν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς τὸ πῶς ἀνέλωσιν αὐτόν: ἐφοβοῦντο γὰρ τὸν λαόν.
3 Εἰσῆλθεν δὲ Σατανᾶς εἰς Ἰούδαν τὸν καλούμενον Ἰσκαριώτην, ὄντα ἐκ τοῦ ἀριθμοῦ τῶν δώδεκα:
4 καὶ ἀπελθὼν συνελάλησεν τοῖς ἀρχιερεῦσιν καὶ στρατηγοῖς τὸ πῶς αὐτοῖς παραδῷ αὐτόν.
5 καὶ ἐχάρησαν, καὶ συνέθεντο αὐτῷ ἀργύριον δοῦναι:
6 καὶ ἐξωμολόγησεν, καὶ ἐζήτει εὐκαιρίαν τοῦ παραδοῦναι αὐτὸν ἄτερ ὄχλου αὐτοῖς.

7 Ἦλθεν δὲ ἡ ἡμέρα τῶν ἀζύμων, ἐν ᾗ ἔδει θύεσθαι τὸ πάσχα,
8 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Πέτρον καὶ Ἰωάννην εἰπών: πορευθέντες ἑτοιμάσατε ἡμῖν τὸ πάσχα ἵνα φάγωμεν.
9 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν αὐτῷ: ποῦ θέλεις ἑτοιμάσωμεν;
10 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: ἰδοὺ εἰσελθόντων ὑμῶν εἰς τὴν πόλιν συναντήσει ὑμῖν ἄνθρωπος κεράμιον ὕδατος βαστάζων: ἀκολουθήσατε αὐτῷ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν εἰς ἣν εἰσπορεύεται.
11 καὶ ἐρεῖτε τῷ οἰκοδεσπότῃ τῆς οἰκίας: λέγει σοι ὁ διδάσκαλος: ποῦ ἐστιν τὸ κατάλυμα ὅπου τὸ πάσχα μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν μου φάγω;
12 κἀκεῖνος ὑμῖν δείξει ἀνάγαιον μέγα ἐστρωμένον: ἐκεῖ ἑτοιμάσατε.
13 ἀπελθόντες δὲ εὗρον καθὼς εἰρήκει αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἡτοίμασαν τὸ πάσχα.
14 Καὶ ὅτε ἐγένετο ἡ ὥρα, ἀνέπεσεν, καὶ οἱ ἀπόστολοι σὺν αὐτῷ.

15 καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς: ἐπιθυμίᾳ ἐπεθύμησα τοῦτο τὸ πάσχα φαγεῖν μεθ' ὑμῶν πρὸ τοῦ με παθεῖν:
16 λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι οὐ μὴ φάγω αὐτὸ ἕως ὅτου πληρωθῇ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ.
17 καὶ δεξάμενος ποτήριον εὐχαριστήσας εἶπεν: λάβετε τοῦτο καὶ διαμερίσατε εἰς ἑαυτούς:
18 λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι οὐ μὴ πίω ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν ἀπὸ τοῦ γενήματος τῆς ἀμπέλου ἕως οὗ ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ ἔλθῃ.
19 Καὶ λαβὼν ἄρτον εὐχαριστήσας ἔκλασεν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς λέγων: τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ σῶμά μου τὸ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν διδόμενον: τοῦτο ποιεῖτε εἰς τὴν ἐμὴν ἀνάμνησιν.
20 καὶ τὸ ποτήριον ὡσαύτως μετὰ τὸ δειπνῆσαι, λέγων: τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον ἡ καινὴ διαθήκη ἐν τῷ αἵματί μου, τὸ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐκχυννόμενον.
21 Πλὴν ἰδοὺ ἡ χεὶρ τοῦ παραδιδόντος με μετ' ἐμοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης:
22 ὅτι ὁ υἱὸς μὲν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου κατὰ τὸ ὡρισμένον πορεύεται, πλὴν οὐαὶ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐκείνῳ δι' οὗ παραδίδοται.
23 καὶ αὐτοὶ ἤρξαντο συζητεῖν πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς τὸ τίς ἄρα εἴη ἐξ αὐτῶν ὁ τοῦτο μέλλων πράσσειν.

24 Ἐγένετο δὲ καὶ φιλονεικία ἐν αὐτοῖς, τὸ τίς αὐτῶν δοκεῖ εἶναι μείζων.
25 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν κυριεύουσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ἐξουσιάζοντες αὐτῶν εὐεργέται καλοῦνται.
26 ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐχ οὕτως, ἀλλ' ὁ μείζων ἐν ὑμῖν γινέσθω ὡς ὁ νεώτερος, καὶ ὁ ἡγούμενος ὡς ὁ διακονῶν.
27 τίς γὰρ μείζων, ὁ ἀνακείμενος ἢ ὁ διακονῶν; οὐχὶ ὁ ἀνακείμενος; ἐγὼ δὲ ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν εἰμι ὡς ὁ διακονῶν.

28 ὑμεῖς δέ ἐστε οἱ διαμεμενηκότες μετ' ἐμοῦ ἐν τοῖς πειρασμοῖς μου:
29 κἀγὼ διατίθεμαι ὑμῖν καθὼς διέθετό μοι ὁ πατήρ μου βασιλείαν,
30 ἵνα ἔσθητε καὶ πίνητε ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης μου ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου, καὶ καθήσεσθε ἐπὶ θρόνων τὰς δώδεκα φυλὰς κρίνοντες τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
31 Σίμων Σίμων, ἰδοὺ ὁ Σατανᾶς ἐξῃτήσατο ὑμᾶς τοῦ σινιάσαι ὡς τὸν σῖτον:
32 ἐγὼ δὲ ἐδεήθην περὶ σοῦ ἵνα μὴ ἐκλίπῃ ἡ πίστις σου. καὶ σύ ποτε ἐπιστρέψας στήρισον τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου.
33 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ: κύριε, μετὰ σοῦ ἕτοιμός εἰμι καὶ εἰς φυλακὴν καὶ εἰς θάνατον πορεύεσθαι.
34 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν: λέγω σοι, Πέτρε, οὐ φωνήσει σήμερον ἀλέκτωρ ἕως τρίς με ἀπαρνήσῃ εἰδέναι
35 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: ὅτε ἀπέστειλα ὑμᾶς ἄτερ βαλλαντίου καὶ πήρας καὶ ὑποδημάτων, μή τινος ὑστερήσατε; οἱ δὲ εἶπαν: οὐθενός.
36 εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς: ἀλλὰ νῦν ὁ ἔχων βαλλάντιον ἀράτω, ὁμοίως καὶ πήραν, καὶ ὁ μὴ ἔχων πωλησάτω τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀγορασάτω μάχαιραν.
37 λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι τοῦτο τὸ γεγραμμένον δεῖ τελεσθῆναι ἐν ἐμοί, τὸ: καὶ μετὰ ἀνόμων ἐλογίσθη: καὶ γὰρ τὸ περὶ ἐμοῦ τέλος ἔχει.
38 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν: κύριε, ἰδοὺ μάχαιραι ὧδε δύο. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: ἱκανόν ἐστιν.

39 Καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἐπορεύθη κατὰ τὸ ἔθος εἰς τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαιῶν: ἠκολούθησαν δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ οἱ μαθηταί.
40 γενόμενος δὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: προσεύχεσθε μὴ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς πειρασμόν.
41 καὶ αὐτὸς ἀπεσπάσθη ἀπ' αὐτῶν ὡσεὶ λίθου βολήν, καὶ θεὶς τὰ γόνατα προσηύχετο
42 λέγων: πάτερ, εἰ βούλει παρένεγκε τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον ἀπ' ἐμοῦ: πλὴν μὴ τὸ θέλημά μου ἀλλὰ τὸ σὸν γινέσθω.
43 ὤφθη δὲ αὐτῷ ἄγγελος ἀπ' οὐρανοῦ ἐνισχύων αὐτόν.
44 καὶ γενόμενος ἐν ἀγωνίᾳ ἐκτενέστερον προσηύχετο: καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ ἱδρὼς αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ θρόμβοι αἵματος καταβαίνοντες ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν.
45 καὶ ἀναστὰς ἀπὸ τῆς προσευχῆς ἐλθὼν πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς εὗρεν κοιμωμένους αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς λύπης,
46 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: τί καθεύδετε; ἀναστάντες προσεύχεσθε, ἵνα μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν.

47 Ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος ἰδοὺ ὄχλος, καὶ ὁ λεγόμενος Ἰούδας εἷς τῶν δώδεκα προήρχετο αὐτούς, καὶ ἤγγισεν τῷ Ἰησοῦ φιλῆσαι αὐτόν.
48 Ἰησοῦς δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ: Ἰούδα, φιλήματι τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου παραδίδως;
49 ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν τὸ ἐσόμενον εἶπαν: κύριε, εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ;
50 καὶ ἐπάταξεν εἷς τις ἐξ αὐτῶν τοῦ ἀρχιερέως τὸν δοῦλον καὶ ἀφεῖλεν τὸ οὖς αὐτοῦ τὸ δεξιόν.
51 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν: ἐᾶτε ἕως τούτου. καὶ ἁψάμενος τοῦ ὠτίου ἰάσατο αὐτόν.
52 εἶπεν δὲ Ἰησοῦς πρὸς τοὺς παραγενομένους ἐπ' αὐτὸν ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ στρατηγοὺς τοῦ ἱεροῦ καὶ πρεσβυτέρους: ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθατε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων:
53 καθ' ἡμέραν ὄντος μου μεθ' ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ οὐκ ἐξετείνατε τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ' ἐμέ. ἀλλ' αὕτη ἐστὶν ὑμῶν ἡ ὥρα καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία τοῦ σκότους.

54 συλλαβόντες δὲ αὐτὸν ἤγαγον καὶ εἰσήγαγον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ ἀρχιερέως: ὁ δὲ Πέτρος ἠκολούθει μακρόθεν.
55 περιαψάντων δὲ πῦρ ἐν μέσῳ τῆς αὐλῆς καὶ συγκαθισάντων ἐκάθητο ὁ Πέτρος μέσος αὐτῶν.
56 ἰδοῦσα δὲ αὐτὸν παιδίσκη τις καθήμενον πρὸς τὸ φῶς καὶ ἀτενίσασα αὐτῷ εἶπεν: καὶ οὗτος σὺν αὐτῷ ἦν.
57 ὁ δὲ ἠρνήσατο λέγων: οὐκ οἶδα αὐτόν, γύναι.
58 καὶ μετὰ βραχὺ ἕτερος ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ἔφη: καὶ σὺ ἐξ αὐτῶν εἶ. ὁ δὲ Πέτρος ἔφη: ἄνθρωπε, οὐκ εἰμί.
59 καὶ διαστάσης ὡσεὶ ὥρας μιᾶς ἄλλος τις διϊσχυρίζετο λέγων: ἐπ' ἀληθείας καὶ οὗτος μετ' αὐτοῦ ἦν: καὶ γὰρ Γαλιλαῖός ἐστιν.
60 εἶπεν δὲ ὁ Πέτρος: ἄνθρωπε, οὐκ οἶδα ὃ λέγεις. καὶ παραχρῆμα ἔτι λαλοῦντος αὐτοῦ ἐφώνησεν ἀλέκτωρ,
61 καὶ στραφεὶς ὁ κύριος ἐνέβλεψεν τῷ Πέτρῳ, καὶ ὑπεμνήσθη ὁ Πέτρος τοῦ ῥήματος τοῦ κυρίου, ὡς εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὅτι πρὶν ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι σήμερον ἀπαρνήσῃ με τρίς.
62 καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἔξω ἔκλαυσεν πικρῶς.

63 Καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ συνέχοντες αὐτὸν ἐνέπαιζον αὐτῷ δέροντες,
64 καὶ περικαλύψαντες αὐτὸν ἐπηρώτων λέγοντες: προφήτευσον, τίς ἐστιν ὁ παίσας σε;
65 καὶ ἕτερα πολλὰ βλασφημοῦντες ἔλεγον εἰς αὐτόν.
66 Καὶ ὡς ἐγένετο ἡμέρα, συνήχθη τὸ πρεσβυτέριον τοῦ λαοῦ, ἀρχιερεῖς τε καὶ γραμματεῖς, καὶ ἀπήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ συνέδριον αὐτῶν,
67 λέγοντες: εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστός, εἰπὸν ἡμῖν. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς: ἐὰν ὑμῖν εἴπω οὐ μὴ πιστεύσητε:
68 ἐὰν δὲ ἐρωτήσω, οὐ μὴ ἀποκριθῆτε.
69 ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν δὲ ἔσται ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου καθήμενος ἐκ δεξιῶν τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ θεοῦ.
70 εἶπαν δὲ πάντες: σὺ οὖν εἶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ; ὁ δὲ πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἔφη: ὑμεῖς λέγετε, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι.
71 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν: τί ἔτι ἔχομεν μαρτυρίας χρείαν; αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἠκούσαμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ.
