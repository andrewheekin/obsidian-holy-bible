# Gospel According to Saint Luke 19 (RSVCE)

### Jesus and Zacchaeus
1 He entered Jericho and was passing through.
2 And there was a man named Zacchaeʹus; he was a chief tax collector, and rich.
3 And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not, on account of the crowd, because he was small of stature.
4 So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way.
5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeʹus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today.”
6 So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.
7 And when they saw it they all murmured, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”
8 And Zacchaeʹus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore it fourfold.”
9 And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.
10 For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.”
### The Parable of the Ten Pounds
11 As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
12 He said therefore, “A nobleman went into a far country to receive kingly power and then return.
13 Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said to them, ‘Trade with these till I come.’
14 But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’
15 When he returned, having received the kingly power, he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading.
16 The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your pound has made ten pounds more.’
17 And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’
18 And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your pound has made five pounds.’
19 And he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’
20 Then another came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your pound, which I kept laid away in a napkin;
21 for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.’
22 He said to him, ‘I will condemn you out of your own mouth, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?
23 Why then did you not put my money into the bank, and at my coming I should have collected it with interest?’
24 And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the pound from him, and give it to him who has the ten pounds.’
25 (And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten pounds!’)
26 ‘I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
27 But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.’ ”
### Jesus’ Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem
28 And when he had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
29 When he drew near to Bethʹphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,
30 saying, “Go into the village opposite, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat; untie it and bring it here.
31 If any one asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this, ‘The Lord has need of it.’ ”
32 So those who were sent went away and found it as he had told them.
33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”
34 And they said, “The Lord has need of it.”
35 And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their garments on the colt they set Jesus upon it.
36 And as he rode along, they spread their garments on the road.
37 As he was now drawing near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,
38 saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”
39 And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”
40 He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.”
### Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem
41 And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it,
42 saying, “Would that even today you knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hid from your eyes.
43 For the days shall come upon you, when your enemies will cast up a bank about you and surround you, and hem you in on every side,
44 and dash you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another in you; because you did not know the time of your visitation.”
### Jesus Cleanses the Temple
45 And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,
46 saying to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be a house of prayer’; but you have made it a den of robbers.”
47 And he was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him;
48 but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people hung upon his words.


# Evangelium Secundum Lucam 19 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et ingressus perambulabat Jericho.
2 Et ecce vir nomine Zachæus: et hic princeps erat publicanorum, et ipse dives:
3 et quærebat videre Jesum, quis esset: et non poterat præ turba, quia statura pusillus erat.
4 Et præcurrens ascendit in arborem sycomorum ut videret eum: quia inde erat transiturus.
5 Et cum venisset ad locum, suspiciens Jesus vidit illum, et dixit ad eum: Zachæe, festinans descende: quia hodie in domo tua oportet me manere.
6 Et festinans descendit, et excepit illum gaudens.
7 Et cum viderent omnes, murmurabant, dicentes quod ad hominem peccatorem divertisset.
8 Stans autem Zachæus, dixit ad Dominum: Ecce dimidium bonorum meorum, Domine, do pauperibus: et si quid aliquem defraudavi, reddo quadruplum.
9 Ait Jesus ad eum: Quia hodie salus domui huic facta est: eo quod et ipse filius sit Abrahæ.
10 Venit enim Filius hominis quærere, et salvum facere quod perierat.

11 Hæc illis audientibus adjiciens, dixit parabolam, eo quod esset prope Jerusalem: et quia existimarent quod confestim regnum Dei manifestaretur.
12 Dixit ergo: Homo quidam nobilis abiit in regionem longinquam accipere sibi regnum, et reverti.
13 Vocatis autem decem servis suis, dedit eis decem mnas, et ait ad illos: Negotiamini dum venio.
14 Cives autem ejus oderant eum: et miserunt legationem post illum, dicentes: Nolumus hunc regnare super nos.
15 Et factum est ut rediret accepto regno: et jussit vocari servos, quibus dedit pecuniam, ut sciret quantum quisque negotiatus esset.
16 Venit autem primus dicens: Domine, mna tua decem mnas acquisivit.
17 Et ait illi: Euge bone serve, quia in modico fuisti fidelis, eris potestatem habens super decem civitates.
18 Et alter venit, dicens: Domine, mna tua fecit quinque mnas.
19 Et huic ait: Et tu esto super quinque civitates.
20 Et alter venit, dicens: Domine, ecce mna tua, quam habui repositam in sudario:
21 timui enim te, quia homo austerus es: tollis quod non posuisti, et metis quod non seminasti.
22 Dicit ei: De ore tuo te judico, serve nequam. Sciebas quod ego homo austerus sum, tollens quod non posui, et metens quod non seminavi:
23 et quare non dedisti pecuniam meam ad mensam, ut ego veniens cum usuris utique exegissem illam?
24 Et astantibus dixit: Auferte ab illo mnam, et date illi qui decem mnas habet.
25 Et dixerunt ei: Domine, habet decem mnas.
26 Dico autem vobis, quia omni habenti dabitur, et abundabit: ab eo autem qui non habet, et quod habet auferetur ab eo.
27 Verumtamen inimicos meos illos, qui noluerunt me regnare super se, adducite huc: et interficite ante me.
28 Et his dictis, præcedebat ascendens Jerosolymam.

29 Et factum est, cum appropinquasset ad Bethphage et Bethaniam, ad montem qui vocatur Oliveti, misit duos discipulos suos,
30 dicens: Ite in castellum quod contra est: in quod introëuntes, invenietis pullum asinæ alligatum, cui nemo umquam hominum sedit: solvite illum, et adducite.
31 Et si quis vos interrogaverit: Quare solvitis? sic dicetis ei: Quia Dominus operam ejus desiderat.
32 Abierunt autem qui missi erant: et invenerunt, sicut dixit illis, stantem pullum.
33 Solventibus autem illis pullum, dixerunt domini ejus ad illos: Quid solvitis pullum?
34 At illi dixerunt: Quia Dominus eum necessarium habet.
35 Et duxerunt illum ad Jesum. Et jacentes vestimenta sua supra pullum, imposuerunt Jesum.
36 Eunte autem illo, substernebant vestimenta sua in via:
37 et cum appropinquaret jam ad descensum montis Oliveti, cœperunt omnes turbæ discipulorum gaudentes laudare Deum voce magna super omnibus, quas viderant, virtutibus,
38 dicentes: Benedictus, qui venit rex in nomine Domini: pax in cælo, et gloria in excelsis.
39 Et quidam pharisæorum de turbis dixerunt ad illum: Magister, increpa discipulos tuos.
40 Quibus ipse ait: Dico vobis, quia si hi tacuerint, lapides clamabunt.

41 Et ut appropinquavit, videns civitatem flevit super illam, dicens:
42 Quia si cognovisses et tu, et quidem in hac die tua, quæ ad pacem tibi: nunc autem abscondita sunt ab oculis tuis.
43 Quia venient dies in te: et circumdabunt te inimici tui vallo, et circumdabunt te: et coangustabunt te undique:
44 et ad terram prosternent te, et filios tuos, qui in te sunt, et non relinquent in te lapidem super lapidem: eo quod non cognoveris tempus visitationis tuæ.
45 Et ingressus in templum, cœpit ejicere vendentes in illo, et ementes,
46 dicens illis: Scriptum est: Quia domus mea domus orationis est: vos autem fecistis illam speluncam latronum.
47 Et erat docens quotidie in templo. Principes autem sacerdotum, et scribæ, et princeps plebis quærebant illum perdere:
48 et non inveniebant quid facerent illi. Omnis enim populus suspensus erat, audiens illum.


# Κατὰ Λουκᾶν 19 (Textus Receptus)

1 Καὶ εἰσελθὼν διήρχετο τὴν Ἰεριχώ.
2 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ ὀνόματι καλούμενος Ζακχαῖος, καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν ἀρχιτελώνης καὶ αὐτὸς πλούσιος.
3 καὶ ἐζήτει ἰδεῖν τὸν Ἰησοῦν τίς ἐστιν, καὶ οὐκ ἠδύνατο ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου, ὅτι τῇ ἡλικίᾳ μικρὸς ἦν.
4 καὶ προδραμὼν εἰς τὸ ἔμπροσθεν ἀνέβη ἐπὶ συκομορέαν, ἵνα ἴδῃ αὐτόν, ὅτι ἐκείνης ἤμελλεν διέρχεσθαι.
5 καὶ ὡς ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον, ἀναβλέψας ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν: Ζακχαῖε, σπεύσας κατάβηθι: σήμερον γὰρ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου δεῖ με μεῖναι.
6 καὶ σπεύσας κατέβη, καὶ ὑπεδέξατο αὐτὸν χαίρων.
7 καὶ ἰδόντες πάντες διεγόγγυζον, λέγοντες ὅτι παρὰ ἁμαρτωλῷ ἀνδρὶ εἰσῆλθεν καταλῦσαι.
8 σταθεὶς δὲ Ζακχαῖος εἶπεν πρὸς τὸν κύριον: ἰδοὺ τὰ ἡμίσιά μου τῶν ὑπαρχόντων, κύριε, τοῖς πτωχοῖς δίδωμι, καὶ εἴ τινός τι ἐσυκοφάντησα ἀποδίδωμι τετραπλοῦν.
9 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ὅτι σήμερον σωτηρία τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ ἐγένετο, καθότι καὶ αὐτὸς υἱὸς Ἀβραάμ: ἐστιν
10 ἦλθεν γὰρ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ζητῆσαι καὶ σῶσαι τὸ ἀπολωλός.

11 Ἀκουόντων δὲ αὐτῶν ταῦτα προσθεὶς εἶπεν παραβολὴν, διὰ τὸ ἐγγὺς εἶναι Ἰερουσαλὴμ αὐτὸν καὶ δοκεῖν αὐτοὺς ὅτι παραχρῆμα μέλλει ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ ἀναφαίνεσθαι.
12 εἶπεν οὖν: ἄνθρωπός τις εὐγενὴς ἐπορεύθη εἰς χώραν μακρὰν, λαβεῖν ἑαυτῷ βασιλείαν καὶ ὑποστρέψαι.
13 καλέσας δὲ δέκα δούλους ἑαυτοῦ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς δέκα μνᾶς, καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς: πραγματεύσασθε ἐν ᾧ ἔρχομαι.
14 οἱ δὲ πολῖται αὐτοῦ ἐμίσουν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπέστειλαν πρεσβείαν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ λέγοντες: οὐ θέλομεν τοῦτον βασιλεῦσαι ἐφ' ἡμᾶς.
15 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐπανελθεῖν αὐτὸν λαβόντα τὴν βασιλείαν, καὶ εἶπεν φωνηθῆναι αὐτῷ τοὺς δούλους τούτους οἷς δεδώκει τὸ ἀργύριον, ἵνα γνοῖ τί διεπραγματεύσαντο.
16 παρεγένετο δὲ ὁ πρῶτος λέγων: κύριε, ἡ μνᾶ σου δέκα προσηργάσατο μνᾶς.
17 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ: εὖγε, ἀγαθὲ δοῦλε, ὅτι ἐν ἐλαχίστῳ πιστὸς ἐγένου, ἴσθι ἐξουσίαν ἔχων ἐπάνω δέκα πόλεων.
18 καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ δεύτερος λέγων: ἡ μνᾶ σου, κύριε, ἐποίησεν πέντε μνᾶς.
19 εἶπεν δὲ καὶ τούτῳ: καὶ σὺ ἐπάνω γίνου πέντε πόλεων.
20 καὶ ὁ ἕτερος ἦλθεν λέγων: κύριε, ἰδοὺ ἡ μνᾶ σου, ἣν εἶχον ἀποκειμένην ἐν σουδαρίῳ:
21 ἐφοβούμην γάρ σε, ὅτι ἄνθρωπος αὐστηρὸς εἶ, αἴρεις ὃ οὐκ ἔθηκας, καὶ θερίζεις ὃ οὐκ ἔσπειρας.
22 λέγει αὐτῷ: ἐκ τοῦ στόματός σου κρίνω σε, πονηρὲ δοῦλε. ᾔδεις ὅτι ἐγὼ ἄνθρωπος αὐστηρός εἰμι, αἴρων ὃ οὐκ ἔθηκα, καὶ θερίζων ὃ οὐκ ἔσπειρα;
23 καὶ διὰ τί οὐκ ἔδωκάς μου τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ τράπεζαν; κἀγὼ ἐλθὼν σὺν τόκῳ ἂν αὐτὸ ἔπραξα.
24 καὶ τοῖς παρεστῶσιν εἶπεν: ἄρατε ἀπ' αὐτοῦ τὴν μνᾶν καὶ δότε τῷ τὰς δέκα μνᾶς ἔχοντι.
25 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ: κύριε, ἔχει δέκα μνᾶς.
26 λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι παντὶ τῷ ἔχοντι δοθήσεται, ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ μὴ ἔχοντος καὶ ὃ ἔχει ἀρθήσεται.
27 πλὴν τοὺς ἐχθρούς μου τούτους τοὺς μὴ θελήσαντάς με βασιλεῦσαι ἐπ' αὐτοὺς ἀγάγετε ὧδε καὶ κατασφάξατε αὐτοὺς ἔμπροσθέν μου.
28 Καὶ εἰπὼν ταῦτα ἐπορεύετο ἔμπροσθεν ἀναβαίνων, εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα.

29 καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤγγισεν εἰς Βηθφαγὴ καὶ Βηθανίαν πρὸς τὸ ὄρος τὸ καλούμενον Ἐλαιῶν ἀπέστειλεν δύο τῶν μαθητῶν
30 λέγων: ὑπάγετε εἰς τὴν κατέναντι κώμην, ἐν ᾗ εἰσπορευόμενοι εὑρήσετε πῶλον δεδεμένον, ἐφ' ὃν οὐδεὶς πώποτε ἀνθρώπων ἐκάθισεν, καὶ λύσαντες αὐτὸν ἀγάγετε.
31 καὶ ἐάν τις ὑμᾶς ἐρωτᾷ: διὰ τί λύετε; οὕτως ἐρεῖτε: ὅτι ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει.
32 ἀπελθόντες δὲ οἱ ἀπεσταλμένοι εὗρον καθὼς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς.
33 λυόντων δὲ αὐτῶν τὸν πῶλον εἶπαν οἱ κύριοι αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτούς: τί λύετε τὸν πῶλον;
34 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν: ὅτι ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει.
35 καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν πρὸς τὸν Ἰησοῦν, καὶ ἐπιρίψαντες αὐτῶν τὰ ἱμάτια ἐπὶ τὸν πῶλον ἐπεβίβασαν τὸν Ἰησοῦν.
36 πορευομένου δὲ αὐτοῦ ὑπεστρώννυον τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ.
37 ἐγγίζοντος δὲ αὐτοῦ ἤδη πρὸς τῇ καταβάσει τοῦ ὄρους τῶν ἐλαιῶν ἤρξαντο ἅπαν τὸ πλῆθος τῶν μαθητῶν χαίροντες αἰνεῖν τὸν θεὸν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ περὶ πασῶν ὧν εἶδον δυνάμεων,
38 λέγοντες: εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου: ἐν οὐρανῷ εἰρήνη, καὶ δόξα ἐν ὑψίστοις.
39 Καί τινες τῶν Φαρισαίων ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν: διδάσκαλε, ἐπιτίμησον τοῖς μαθηταῖς σου.
40 καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν: λέγω ὑμῖν, ἐὰν οὗτοι σιωπήσουσιν, οἱ λίθοι κράξουσιν.

41 Καὶ ὡς ἤγγισεν, ἰδὼν τὴν πόλιν ἔκλαυσεν ἐπ' αὐτήν,
42 λέγων ὅτι εἰ ἔγνως ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ καὶ σὺ τὰ πρὸς εἰρήνην: νῦν δὲ ἐκρύβη ἀπὸ ὀφθαλμῶν σου.
43 ὅτι ἥξουσιν ἡμέραι ἐπὶ σὲ, καὶ παρεμβαλοῦσιν οἱ ἐχθροί σου χάρακά σοι καὶ περικυκλώσουσίν σε καὶ συνέξουσίν σε πάντοθεν,
44 καὶ ἐδαφιοῦσίν σε καὶ τὰ τέκνα σου ἐν σοί, καὶ οὐκ ἀφήσουσιν λίθον ἐπὶ λίθον ἐν σοί, ἀνθ' ὧν οὐκ ἔγνως τὸν καιρὸν τῆς ἐπισκοπῆς σου.
45 Καὶ εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν ἤρξατο ἐκβάλλειν τοὺς πωλοῦντας,
46 λέγων αὐτοῖς: γέγραπται: καὶ ἔσται ὁ οἶκός μου οἶκος προσευχῆς: ὑμεῖς δὲ αὐτὸν ἐποιήσατε σπήλαιον λῃστῶν.
47 Καὶ ἦν διδάσκων τὸ καθ' ἡμέραν ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ: οἱ δὲ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς ἐζήτουν αὐτὸν ἀπολέσαι καὶ οἱ πρῶτοι τοῦ λαοῦ,
48 καὶ οὐχ εὕρισκον τὸ τί ποιήσωσιν: ὁ λαὸς γὰρ ἅπας ἐξεκρέματο αὐτοῦ ἀκούων.
