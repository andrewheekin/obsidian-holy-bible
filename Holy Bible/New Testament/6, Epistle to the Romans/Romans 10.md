# Letter of Paul to the Romans 10 (RSVCE)

1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.
2 I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but it is not enlightened.
3 For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.
4 For Christ is the end of the law, that every one who has faith may be justified.
### Salvation Is for All
5 Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on the law shall live by it.
6 But the righteousness based on faith says, Do not say in your heart, “Who will ascend into heaven?” (that is, to bring Christ down)
7 or “Who will descend into the abyss?” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
8 But what does it say? The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart (that is, the word of faith which we preach);
9 because, if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
10 For man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he confesses with his lips and so is saved.
11 The scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.”
12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon him.
13 For, “every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.”
14 But how are men to call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher?
15 And how can men preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news!”
16 But they have not all heeded the gospel; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?”
17 So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ.
18 But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for “Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.”
19 Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, “I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry.”
20 Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, “I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.”
21 But of Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”


# Epistola ad Romanos 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Fratres, voluntas quidem cordis mei, et obsecratio ad Deum, fit pro illis in salutem.
2 Testimonium enim perhibeo illis quod æmulationem Dei habent, sed non secundum scientiam.
3 Ignorantes enim justitiam Dei, et suam quærentes statuere, justitiæ Dei non sunt subjecti.
4 Finis enim legis, Christus, ad justitiam omni credenti.
5 Moyses enim scripsit, quoniam justitiam, quæ ex lege est, qui fecerit homo, vivet in ea.
6 Quæ autem ex fide est justitia, sic dicit: Ne dixeris in corde tuo: Quis ascendet in cælum? id est, Christum deducere:
7 aut, Quis descendet in abyssum? hoc est, Christum a mortuis revocare.
8 Sed quid dicit Scriptura? Prope est verbum in ore tuo, et in corde tuo: hoc est verbum fidei, quod prædicamus.
9 Quia si confitearis in ore tuo Dominum Jesum, et in corde tuo credideris quod Deus illum suscitavit a mortuis, salvus eris.
10 Corde enim creditur ad justitiam: ore autem confessio fit ad salutem.
11 Dicit enim Scriptura: Omnis qui credit in illum, non confundetur.

12 Non enim est distinctio Judæi et Græci: nam idem Dominus omnium, dives in omnes qui invocant illum.
13 Omnis enim quicumque invocaverit nomen Domini, salvus erit.
14 Quomodo ergo invocabunt, in quem non crediderunt? aut quomodo credent ei, quem non audierunt? quomodo autem audient sine prædicante?
15 quomodo vero prædicabunt nisi mittantur? sicut scriptum est: Quam speciosi pedes evangelizantium pacem, evangelizantium bona!
16 Sed non omnes obediunt Evangelio. Isaias enim dicit: Domine, quis credidit auditui nostro?
17 Ergo fides ex auditu, auditus autem per verbum Christi.
18 Sed dico: Numquid non audierunt? Et quidem in omnem terram exivit sonus eorum, et in fines orbis terræ verba eorum.
19 Sed dico: Numquid Israël non cognovit? Primus Moyses dicit: Ego ad æmulationem vos adducam in non gentem: in gentem insipientem, in iram vos mittam.
20 Isaias autem audet, et dicit: Inventus sum a non quærentibus me: palam apparui iis qui me non interrogabant.
21 Ad Israël autem dicit: Tota die expandi manus meas ad populum non credentem, et contradicentem.


# Πρὸς Ῥωμαίους 10 (Textus Receptus)

1 ἀδελφοί, ἡ μὲν εὐδοκία τῆς ἐμῆς καρδίας καὶ ἡ δέησις πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν εἰς σωτηρίαν.
2 μαρτυρῶ γὰρ αὐτοῖς ὅτι ζῆλον θεοῦ ἔχουσιν, ἀλλ' οὐ κατ' ἐπίγνωσιν:
3 ἀγνοοῦντες γὰρ τὴν τοῦ θεοῦ δικαιοσύνην, καὶ τὴν ἰδίαν δικαιοσύνην ζητοῦντες στῆσαι, τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ τοῦ θεοῦ οὐχ ὑπετάγησαν:
4 τέλος γὰρ νόμου Χριστὸς εἰς δικαιοσύνην παντὶ τῷ πιστεύοντι.
5 Μωϋσῆς γὰρ γράφει τὴν δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐκ τοῦ νόμου ὅτι ὁ ποιήσας αὐτὰ ἄνθρωπος ζήσεται ἐν αὐτοῖς.
6 ἡ δὲ ἐκ πίστεως δικαιοσύνη οὕτως λέγει, μὴ εἴπῃς ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, τίς ἀναβήσεται εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν; τοῦτ' ἔστιν Χριστὸν καταγαγεῖν:
7 ἤ, τίς καταβήσεται εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον; τοῦτ' ἔστιν Χριστὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναγαγεῖν.
8 ἀλλὰ τί λέγει; ἐγγύς σου τὸ ῥῆμά ἐστιν, ἐν τῷ στόματί σου καὶ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου: τοῦτ' ἔστιν τὸ ῥῆμα τῆς πίστεως ὃ κηρύσσομεν.
9 ὅτι ἐὰν ὁμολογήσῃς ἐν τῷ στόματί σου κύριον Ἰησοῦν, καὶ πιστεύσῃς ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου ὅτι ὁ θεὸς αὐτὸν ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν, σωθήσῃ:
10 καρδίᾳ γὰρ πιστεύεται εἰς δικαιοσύνην, στόματι δὲ ὁμολογεῖται εἰς σωτηρίαν.
11 λέγει γὰρ ἡ γραφή, πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων ἐπ' αὐτῷ οὐ καταισχυνθήσεται.

12 οὐ γάρ ἐστιν διαστολὴ Ἰουδαίου τε καὶ Ἕλληνος, ὁ γὰρ αὐτὸς κύριος πάντων, πλουτῶν εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἐπικαλουμένους αὐτόν:
13 πᾶς γὰρ ὃς ἂν ἐπικαλέσηται τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου σωθήσεται.
14 πῶς οὖν ἐπικαλέσωνται εἰς ὃν οὐκ ἐπίστευσαν; πῶς δὲ πιστεύσωσιν οὗ οὐκ ἤκουσαν; πῶς δὲ ἀκούσωσιν χωρὶς κηρύσσοντος;
15 πῶς δὲ κηρύξωσιν ἐὰν μὴ ἀποσταλῶσιν; καθὼς γέγραπται, ὡς ὡραῖοι οἱ πόδες τῶν εὐαγγελιζομένων τὰ ἀγαθά.
16 ἀλλ' οὐ πάντες ὑπήκουσαν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ: Ἠσαΐας γὰρ λέγει, κύριε, τίς ἐπίστευσεν τῇ ἀκοῇ ἡμῶν;
17 ἄρα ἡ πίστις ἐξ ἀκοῆς, ἡ δὲ ἀκοὴ διὰ ῥήματος Χριστοῦ.
18 ἀλλὰ λέγω, μὴ οὐκ ἤκουσαν; μενοῦνγε, εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἐξῆλθεν ὁ φθόγγος αὐτῶν, καὶ εἰς τὰ πέρατα τῆς οἰκουμένης τὰ ῥήματα αὐτῶν.
19 ἀλλὰ λέγω, μὴ Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ ἔγνω; πρῶτος Μωϋσῆς λέγει, ἐγὼ παραζηλώσω ὑμᾶς ἐπ' οὐκ ἔθνει, ἐπ' ἔθνει ἀσυνέτῳ παροργιῶ ὑμᾶς.
20 Ἠσαΐας δὲ ἀποτολμᾷ καὶ λέγει, εὑρέθην ἐν τοῖς ἐμὲ μὴ ζητοῦσιν, ἐμφανὴς ἐγενόμην τοῖς ἐμὲ μὴ ἐπερωτῶσιν.
21 πρὸς δὲ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ λέγει, ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐξεπέτασα τὰς χεῖράς μου πρὸς λαὸν ἀπειθοῦντα καὶ ἀντιλέγοντα.
