# Gospel According to Saint John 7 (RSVCE)

### The Unbelief of Jesus’ Brethren
1 After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
2 Now the Jews’ feast of Tabernacles was at hand.
3 So his brethren said to him, “Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works you are doing.
4 For no man works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.”
5 For even his brethren did not believe in him.
6 Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.
7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil.
8 Go to the feast yourselves; I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.”
9 So saying, he remained in Galilee.
### Jesus at the Festival of Booths
10 But after his brethren had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private.
11 The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, “Where is he?”
12 And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, “He is a good man,” others said, “No, he is leading the people astray.”
13 Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.
14 About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
15 The Jews marveled at it, saying, “How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?”
16 So Jesus answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me;
17 if any man’s will is to do his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.
18 He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.
19 Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?”
20 The people answered, “You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?”
21 Jesus answered them, “I did one deed, and you all marvel at it.
22 Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man upon the sabbath.
23 If on the sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the sabbath I made a man’s whole body well?
24 Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.”
### Is This the Christ?
25 Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, “Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?
26 And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ?
27 Yet we know where this man comes from; and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.”
28 So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, “You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true, and him you do not know.
29 I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.”
30 So they sought to arrest him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.
31 Yet many of the people believed in him; they said, “When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?”
### Officers Are Sent to Arrest Jesus
32 The Pharisees heard the crowd thus muttering about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.
33 Jesus then said, “I shall be with you a little longer, and then I go to him who sent me;
34 you will seek me and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come.”
35 The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
36 What does he mean by saying, ‘You will seek me and you will not find me,’ and, ‘Where I am you cannot come’?”
### Rivers of Living Water
37 On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and proclaimed, “If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink.
38 He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.’ ”
39 Now this he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
### Division among the People
40 When they heard these words, some of the people said, “This is really the prophet.”
41 Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “Is the Christ to come from Galilee?
42 Has not the scripture said that the Christ is descended from David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”
43 So there was a division among the people over him.
44 Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.
### The Unbelief of Those in Authority
45 The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why did you not bring him?”
46 The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!”
47 The Pharisees answered them, “Are you led astray, you also?
48 Have any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him?
49 But this crowd, who do not know the law, are accursed.”
50 Nicodeʹmus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them,
51 “Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?”
52 They replied, “Are you from Galilee too? Search and you will see that no prophet is to rise from Galilee.”
53 They went each to his own house,


# Evangelium Secundum Joannem 7 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Post hæc autem ambulabat Jesus in Galilæam: non enim volebat in Judæam ambulare, quia quærebant eum Judæi interficere.
2 Erat autem in proximo dies festus Judæorum, Scenopegia.
3 Dixerunt autem ad eum fratres ejus: Transi hinc, et vade in Judæam, ut et discipuli tui videant opera tua, quæ facis.
4 Nemo quippe in occulto quid facit, et quærit ipse in palam esse: si hæc facis, manifesta teipsum mundo.
5 Neque enim fratres ejus credebant in eum.
6 Dicit ergo eis Jesus: Tempus meum nondum advenit: tempus autem vestrum semper est paratum.
7 Non potest mundus odisse vos: me autem odit, quia ego testimonium perhibeo de illo quod opera ejus mala sunt.
8 Vos ascendite ad diem festum hunc, ego autem non ascendo ad diem festum istum: quia meum tempus nondum impletum est.
9 Hæc cum dixisset, ipse mansit in Galilæa.

10 Ut autem ascenderunt fratres ejus, tunc et ipse ascendit ad diem festum non manifeste, sed quasi in occulto.
11 Judæi ergo quærebant eum in die festo, et dicebant: Ubi est ille?
12 Et murmur multum erat in turba de eo. Quidam enim dicebant: Quia bonus est. Alii autem dicebant: Non, sed seducit turbas.
13 Nemo tamen palam loquebatur de illo propter metum Judæorum.
14 Jam autem die festo mediante, ascendit Jesus in templum, et docebat.
15 Et mirabantur Judæi, dicentes: Quomodo hic litteras scit, cum non didicerit?
16 Respondit eis Jesus, et dixit: Mea doctrina non est mea, sed ejus qui misit me.
17 Si quis voluerit voluntatem ejus facere, cognoscet de doctrina, utrum ex Deo sit, an ego a meipso loquar.
18 Qui a semetipso loquitur, gloriam propriam quærit; qui autem quærit gloriam ejus qui misit eum, hic verax est, et injustitia in illo non est.
19 Nonne Moyses dedit vobis legem: et nemo ex vobis facit legem?
20 Quid me quæritis interficere? Respondit turba, et dixit: Dæmonium habes: quis te quæret interficere?
21 Respondit Jesus et dixit eis: Unum opus feci, et omnes miramini:
22 propterea Moyses dedit vobis circumcisionem (non quia ex Moyse est, sed ex patribus), et in sabbato circumciditis hominem.
23 Si circumcisionem accipit homo in sabbato, ut non solvatur lex Moysi: mihi indignamini quia totum hominem sanum feci in sabbato?
24 Nolite judicare secundum faciem, sed justum judicium judicate.

25 Dicebant ergo quidam ex Jerosolymis: Nonne hic est, quem quærunt interficere?
26 et ecce palam loquitur, et nihil ei dicunt. Numquid vere cognoverunt principes quia hic est Christus?
27 Sed hunc scimus unde sit: Christus autem cum venerit, nemo scit unde sit.
28 Clamabat ergo Jesus in templo docens, et dicens: Et me scitis, et unde sim scitis: et a meipso non veni, sed est verus qui misit me, quem vos nescitis.
29 Ego scio eum: quia ab ipso sum, et ipse me misit.
30 Quærebant ergo eum apprehendere: et nemo misit in illum manus, quia nondum venerat hora ejus.
31 De turba autem multi crediderunt in eum, et dicebant: Christus cum venerit, numquid plura signa faciet quam quæ hic facit?
32 Audierunt pharisæi turbam murmurantem de illo hæc: et miserunt principes et pharisæi ministros ut apprehenderent eum.
33 Dixit ergo eis Jesus: Adhuc modicum tempus vobiscum sum: et vado ad eum qui me misit.
34 Quæretis me, et non invenietis: et ubi ego sum, vos non potestis venire.
35 Dixerunt ergo Judæi ad semetipsos: Quo hic iturus est, quia non inveniemus eum? numquid in dispersionem gentium iturus est, et docturus gentes?
36 quis est hic sermo, quem dixit: Quæretis me, et non invenietis: et ubi sum ego, vos non potestis venire?

37 In novissimo autem die magno festivitatis stabat Jesus, et clamabat dicens: Si quis sitit, veniat ad me et bibat.
38 Qui credit in me, sicut dicit Scriptura, flumina de ventre ejus fluent aquæ vivæ.
39 Hoc autem dixit de Spiritu, quem accepturi erant credentes in eum: nondum enim erat Spiritus datus, quia Jesus nondum erat glorificatus.
40 Ex illa ergo turba cum audissent hos sermones ejus, dicebant: Hic est vere propheta.
41 Alii dicebant: Hic est Christus. Quidam autem dicebant: Numquid a Galilæa venit Christus?
42 nonne Scriptura dicit: Quia ex semine David, et de Bethlehem castello, ubi erat David, venit Christus?
43 Dissensio itaque facta est in turba propter eum.
44 Quidam autem ex ipsis volebant apprehendere eum: sed nemo misit super eum manus.

45 Venerunt ergo ministri ad pontifices et pharisæos. Et dixerunt eis illi: Quare non adduxistis illum?
46 Responderunt ministri: Numquam sic locutus est homo, sicut hic homo.
47 Responderunt ergo eis pharisæi: Numquid et vos seducti estis?
48 numquid ex principibus aliquis credidit in eum, aut ex pharisæis?
49 sed turba hæc, quæ non novit legem, maledicti sunt.
50 Dixit Nicodemus ad eos, ille qui venit ad eum nocte, qui unus erat ex ipsis:
51 Numquid lex nostra judicat hominem, nisi prius audierit ab ipso, et cognoverit quid faciat?
52 Responderunt, et dixerunt ei: Numquid et tu Galilæus es? scrutare Scripturas, et vide quia a Galilæa propheta non surgit.
53 Et reversi sunt unusquisque in domum suam.


# Κατὰ Ἰωάννην 7 (Textus Receptus)

1 καὶ Μετὰ ταῦτα περιεπάτει ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ: οὐ γὰρ ἤθελεν ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ περιπατεῖν, ὅτι ἐζήτουν αὐτὸν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἀποκτεῖναι.
2 ἦν δὲ ἐγγὺς ἡ ἑορτὴ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἡ σκηνοπηγία.
3 εἶπον οὖν πρὸς αὐτὸν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ: μετάβηθι ἐντεῦθεν καὶ ὕπαγε εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν, ἵνα καὶ οἱ μαθηταί σου θεωρήσουσιν σοῦ τὰ ἔργα ἃ ποιεῖς:
4 οὐδεὶς γάρ τι ἐν κρυπτῷ ποιεῖ καὶ ζητεῖ αὐτὸς ἐν παρρησίᾳ εἶναι. εἰ ταῦτα ποιεῖς, φανέρωσον σεαυτὸν τῷ κόσμῳ.
5 οὐδὲ γὰρ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπίστευον εἰς αὐτόν.
6 λέγει οὖν αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς: ὁ καιρὸς ὁ ἐμὸς οὔπω πάρεστιν, ὁ δὲ καιρὸς ὁ ὑμέτερος πάντοτέ ἐστιν ἕτοιμος.
7 οὐ δύναται ὁ κόσμος μισεῖν ὑμᾶς, ἐμὲ δὲ μισεῖ, ὅτι ἐγὼ μαρτυρῶ περὶ αὐτοῦ ὅτι τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ πονηρά ἐστιν.
8 ὑμεῖς ἀνάβητε εἰς τὴν ἑορτήν: ἐγὼ οὐκ ἀναβαίνω εἰς τὴν ἑορτὴν ταύτην, ὅτι ὁ ἐμὸς καιρὸς οὔπω πεπλήρωται.
9 ταῦτα δὲ εἰπὼν αὐτὸς ἔμεινεν ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ.

10 ὡς δὲ ἀνέβησαν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἑορτήν, τότε καὶ αὐτὸς ἀνέβη, οὐ φανερῶς ἀλλὰ' ὡς ἐν κρυπτῷ.
11 οἱ οὖν Ἰουδαῖοι ἐζήτουν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ καὶ ἔλεγον: ποῦ ἐστιν ἐκεῖνος;
12 καὶ γογγυσμὸς περὶ αὐτοῦ ἦν πολὺς ἐν τοῖς ὄχλοις: οἱ μὲν ἔλεγον ὅτι ἀγαθός ἐστιν: ἄλλοι δὲ ἔλεγον: οὔ, ἀλλὰ πλανᾷ τὸν ὄχλον.
13 οὐδεὶς μέντοι παρρησίᾳ ἐλάλει περὶ αὐτοῦ διὰ τὸν φόβον τῶν Ἰουδαίων.
14 Ἤδη δὲ τῆς ἑορτῆς μεσούσης ἀνέβη Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν καὶ ἐδίδασκεν.
15 ἐθαύμαζον οὖν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι λέγοντες: πῶς οὗτος γράμματα οἶδεν μὴ μεμαθηκώς;
16 ἀπεκρίθη οὖν αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ εἶπεν: ἡ ἐμὴ διδαχὴ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐμὴ ἀλλὰ τοῦ πέμψαντός με:
17 ἐάν τις θέλῃ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ ποιεῖν, γνώσεται περὶ τῆς διδαχῆς πότερον ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστιν ἢ ἐγὼ ἀπ' ἐμαυτοῦ λαλῶ.
18 ὁ ἀφ' ἑαυτοῦ λαλῶν τὴν δόξαν τὴν ἰδίαν ζητεῖ: ὁ δὲ ζητῶν τὴν δόξαν τοῦ πέμψαντος αὐτόν, οὗτος ἀληθής ἐστιν καὶ ἀδικία ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστιν.
19 οὐ Μωϋσῆς δέδωκεν ὑμῖν τὸν νόμον; καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐξ ὑμῶν ποιεῖ τὸν νόμον. τί με ζητεῖτε ἀποκτεῖναι;
20 ἀπεκρίθη ὁ ὄχλος: δαιμόνιον ἔχεις: τίς σε ζητεῖ ἀποκτεῖναι;
21 ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: ἓν ἔργον ἐποίησα καὶ πάντες θαυμάζετε.
22 διὰ τοῦτο Μωϋσῆς δέδωκεν. ὑμῖν τὴν περιτομήν, οὐχ ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ Μωϋσέως ἐστὶν, ἀλλ' ἐκ τῶν πατέρων, καὶ ἐν σαββάτῳ περιτέμνετε ἄνθρωπον.
23 εἰ περιτομὴν λαμβάνει ἄνθρωπος ἐν σαββάτῳ ἵνα μὴ λυθῇ ὁ νόμος Μωϋσέως, ἐμοὶ χολᾶτε ὅτι ὅλον ἄνθρωπον ὑγιῆ ἐποίησα ἐν σαββάτῳ;
24 μὴ κρίνετε κατ' ὄψιν, ἀλλὰ τὴν δικαίαν κρίσιν κρίνετε.

25 Ἔλεγον οὖν τινες ἐκ τῶν Ἱεροσολυμιτῶν: οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν ὃν ζητοῦσιν ἀποκτεῖναι;
26 καὶ ἴδε παρρησίᾳ λαλεῖ, καὶ οὐδὲν αὐτῷ λέγουσιν. μήποτε ἀληθῶς ἔγνωσαν οἱ ἄρχοντες ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστός;
27 ἀλλὰ τοῦτον οἴδαμεν πόθεν ἐστίν: ὁ δὲ Χριστὸς ὅταν ἔρχηται, οὐδεὶς γινώσκει πόθεν ἐστίν.
28 ἔκραξεν οὖν ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ διδάσκων ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ λέγων: κἀμὲ οἴδατε καὶ οἴδατε πόθεν εἰμί: καὶ ἀπ' ἐμαυτοῦ οὐκ ἐλήλυθα, ἀλλ' ἔστιν ἀληθινὸς ὁ πέμψας με, ὃν ὑμεῖς οὐκ οἴδατε:
29 ἐγὼ οἶδα αὐτόν, ὅτι παρ' αὐτοῦ εἰμι κἀκεῖνός με ἀπέστειλεν.
30 ἐζήτουν οὖν αὐτὸν πιάσαι, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐπέβαλεν ἐπ' αὐτὸν τὴν χεῖρα, ὅτι οὔπω ἐληλύθει ἡ ὥρα αὐτοῦ.
31 Ἐκ τοῦ ὄχλου δὲ πολλοὶ ἐπίστευσαν εἰς αὐτόν, καὶ ἔλεγον: ὁ Χριστὸς ὅταν ἔλθῃ μὴ πλείονα σημεῖα ποιήσει ὧν οὗτος ἐποίησεν;
32 ἤκουσαν οἱ Φαρισαῖοι τοῦ ὄχλου γογγύζοντος περὶ αὐτοῦ ταῦτα, καὶ ἀπέστειλαν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι ὑπηρέτας ἵνα πιάσωσιν αὐτόν.
33 εἶπεν οὖν ὁ Ἰησοῦς: ἔτι χρόνον μικρὸν μεθ' ὑμῶν εἰμι καὶ ὑπάγω πρὸς τὸν πέμψαντά με.
34 ζητήσετέ με καὶ οὐχ εὑρήσετέ, με καὶ ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγὼ ὑμεῖς οὐ δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν.
35 εἶπον οὖν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι πρὸς ἑαυτούς: ποῦ οὗτος μέλλει πορεύεσθαι, ὅτι ἡμεῖς οὐχ εὑρήσομεν αὐτόν; μὴ εἰς τὴν διασπορὰν τῶν Ἑλλήνων μέλλει πορεύεσθαι καὶ διδάσκειν τοὺς Ἕλληνας;
36 τίς ἐστιν ὁ λόγος οὗτος ὃν εἶπεν: ζητήσετέ με καὶ οὐχ εὑρήσετέ, με καὶ ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγὼ ὑμεῖς οὐ δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν;

37 Ἐν δὲ τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ μεγάλῃ τῆς ἑορτῆς εἱστήκει ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἔκραξεν λέγων: ἐάν τις διψᾷ, ἐρχέσθω πρός με καὶ πινέτω.
38 ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμέ, καθὼς εἶπεν ἡ γραφή, ποταμοὶ ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας αὐτοῦ ῥεύσουσιν ὕδατος ζῶντος.
39 τοῦτο δὲ εἶπεν περὶ τοῦ πνεύματος ὃ ἔμελλον λαμβάνειν οἱ πιστεύσαντες εἰς αὐτόν: οὔπω γὰρ ἦν πνεῦμα, ὅτι Ἰησοῦς οὐδέπω ἐδοξάσθη.
40 Ἐκ τοῦ ὄχλου οὖν ἀκούσαντες τῶν λόγων τούτων ἔλεγον: οὗτός ἐστιν ἀληθῶς ὁ προφήτης:
41 ἄλλοι ἔλεγον: οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστός: οἱ δὲ ἔλεγον: μὴ γὰρ ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ὁ Χριστὸς ἔρχεται;
42 οὐχ ἡ γραφὴ εἶπεν ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος Δαυίδ καὶ ἀπὸ Βηθλέεμ τῆς κώμης ὅπου ἦν Δαυίδ, ἔρχεται ὁ Χριστὸς
43 σχίσμα οὖν ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ὄχλῳ δι' αὐτόν:
44 τινὲς δὲ ἤθελον ἐξ αὐτῶν πιάσαι αὐτόν, ἀλλ' οὐδεὶς ἐπέβαλεν ἐπ' αὐτὸν τὰς χεῖρας.

45 Ἦλθον οὖν οἱ ὑπηρέται πρὸς τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ Φαρισαίους, καὶ εἶπον αὐτοῖς ἐκεῖνοι, διὰ τί οὐκ ἠγάγετε αὐτόν;
46 ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ ὑπηρέται: οὐδέποτε ἐλάλησεν οὕτως ἄνθρωπος.
47 ἀπεκρίθησαν οὖν αὐτοῖς οἱ Φαρισαῖοι: μὴ καὶ ὑμεῖς πεπλάνησθε;
48 μή τις ἐκ τῶν ἀρχόντων ἐπίστευσεν εἰς αὐτὸν ἢ ἐκ τῶν Φαρισαίων;
49 ἀλλὰ ὁ ὄχλος οὗτος ὁ μὴ γινώσκων τὸν νόμον ἐπάρατοί εἰσιν.
50 λέγει Νικόδημος πρὸς αὐτούς, ὁ ἐλθὼν πρὸς αὐτὸν τὸ πρότερον εἷς ὢν ἐξ αὐτῶν:
51 μὴ ὁ νόμος ἡμῶν κρίνει τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ πρῶτον παρ' αὐτοῦ καὶ γνῷ τί ποιεῖ;
52 ἀπεκρίθησαν καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ: μὴ καὶ σὺ ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας εἶ; ἐραύνησον καὶ ἴδε ὅτι ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας προφήτης οὐκ ἐγείρεται.
53 [Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ,]
