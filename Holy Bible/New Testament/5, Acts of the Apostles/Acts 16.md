# Acts of the Apostles 16 (RSVCE)

### Timothy Joins Paul and Silas
1 And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer; but his father was a Greek.
2 He was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Icoʹnium.
3 Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
4 As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.
5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.
### Paul’s Vision of the Man of Macedonia
6 And they went through the region of Phryʹgia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
7 And when they had come opposite Myʹsia, they attempted to go into Bithynʹia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;
8 so, passing by Myʹsia, they went down to Troʹas.
9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedoʹnia was standing beseeching him and saying, “Come over to Macedoʹnia and help us.”
10 And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedoʹnia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
### The Conversion of Lydia
11 Setting sail therefore from Troʹas, we made a direct voyage to Samʹothrace, and the following day to Ne-apʹolis,
12 and from there to Philippi, which is the leading city of the district of Macedoʹnia, and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days;
13 and on the sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
14 One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatiʹra, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to give heed to what was said by Paul.
15 And when she was baptized, with her household, she besought us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.” And she prevailed upon us.
### Paul and Silas in Prison
16 As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by soothsaying.
17 She followed Paul and us, crying, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.”
18 And this she did for many days. But Paul was annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, “I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And it came out that very hour.
19 But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the rulers;
20 and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said, “These men are Jews and they are disturbing our city.
21 They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”
22 The crowd joined in attacking them; and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods.
23 And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely.
24 Having received this charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
25 But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,
26 and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and every one’s fetters were unfastened.
27 When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.”
29 And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas,
30 and brought them out and said, “Men, what must I do to be saved?”
31 And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”
32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house.
33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he was baptized at once, with all his family.
34 Then he brought them up into his house, and set food before them; and he rejoiced with all his household that he had believed in God.
35 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, “Let those men go.”
36 And the jailer reported the words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out and go in peace.”
37 But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now cast us out secretly? No! let them come themselves and take us out.”
38 The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens;
39 so they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city.
40 So they went out of the prison, and visited Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they exhorted them and departed.


# Actus Apostolorum 16 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Pervenit autem Derben et Lystram. Et ecce discipulus quidam erat ibi nomine Timotheus, filius mulieris Judææ fidelis, patre gentili.
2 Huic testimonium bonum reddebant qui in Lystris erant et Iconio fratres.
3 Hunc voluit Paulus secum proficisci: et assumens circumcidit eum propter Judæos qui erant in illis locis. Sciebant enim omnes quod pater ejus erat gentilis.
4 Cum autem pertransirent civitates, tradebant eis custodiri dogmata quæ erant decreta ab Apostolis et senioribus qui erant Jerosolymis.
5 Et ecclesiæ quidem confirmabantur fide, et abundabunt numero quotidie.
6 Transeuntes autem Phrygiam et Galatiæ regionem, vetati sunt a Spiritu Sancto loqui verbum Dei in Asia.
7 Cum venissent autem in Mysiam, tentabant ire in Bithyniam: et non permisit eos Spiritus Jesu.
8 Cum autem pertransissent Mysiam, descenderunt Troadem:

9 et visio per noctem Paulo ostensa est: vir Macedo quidam erat stans et deprecans eum, et dicens: Transiens in Macedoniam, adjuva nos.
10 Ut autem visum vidit, statim quæsivimus proficisci in Macedoniam, certi facti quod vocasset nos Deus evangelizare eis.
11 Navigantes autem a Troade, recto cursu venimus Samothraciam, et sequenti die Neapolim:
12 et inde Philippos, quæ est prima partis Macedoniæ civitas, colonia. Eramus autem in hac urbe diebus aliquot, conferentes.
13 Die autem sabbatorum egressi sumus foras portam juxta flumen, ubi videbatur oratio esse: et sedentes loquebamur mulieribus quæ convenerant.
14 Et quædam mulier nomine Lydia, purpuraria civitatis Thyatirenorum, colens Deum, audivit: cujus Dominus aperuit cor intendere his quæ dicebantur a Paulo.
15 Cum autem baptizata esset, et domus ejus, deprecata est, dicens: Si judicastis me fidelem Domino esse, introite in domum meam, et manete. Et coëgit nos.
16 Factum est autem euntibus nobis ad orationem, puellam quamdam habentem spiritum pythonem obviare nobis, quæ quæstum magnum præstabat dominis suis divinando.
17 Hæc subsecuta Paulum et nos, clamabat dicens: Isti homines servi Dei excelsi sunt, qui annuntiant vobis viam salutis.
18 Hoc autem faciebat multis diebus. Dolens autem Paulus, et conversus, spiritui dixit: Præcipio tibi in nomine Jesu Christi exire ab ea. Et exiit eadem hora.

19 Videntes autem domini ejus quia exivit spes quæstus eorum, apprehendentes Paulum et Silam, perduxerunt in forum ad principes:
20 et offerentes eos magistratibus, dixerunt: Hi homines conturbant civitatem nostram, cum sint Judæi:
21 et annuntiant morem quem non licet nobis suscipere neque facere, cum simus Romani.
22 Et cucurrit plebs adversus eos: et magistratus, scissis tunicis eorum, jusserunt eos virgis cædi.
23 Et cum multas plagas eis imposuissent, miserunt eos in carcerem, præcipientes custodi ut diligenter custodiret eos.
24 Qui cum tale præceptum accepisset, misit eos in interiorem carcerem, et pedes eorum strinxit ligno.
25 Media autem nocte Paulus et Silas orantes, laudabant Deum: et audiebant eos qui in custodia erant.
26 Subito vero terræmotus factus est magnus, ita ut moverentur fundamenta carceris. Et statim aperta sunt omnia ostia: et universorum vincula soluta sunt.
27 Expergefactus autem custos carceris, et videns januas apertas carceris, evaginato gladio volebat se interficere, æstimans fugisse vinctos.
28 Clamavit autem Paulus voce magna, dicens: Nihil tibi mali feceris: universi enim hic sumus.
29 Petitoque lumine, introgressus est: et tremefactus procidit Paulo et Silæ ad pedes:
30 et producens eos foras, ait: Domini, quid me oportet facere, ut salvus fiam?
31 At illi dixerunt: Crede in Dominum Jesum, et salvus eris tu, et domus tua.
32 Et locuti sunt ei verbum Domini cum omnibus qui erant in domo ejus.
33 Et tollens eos in illa hora noctis, lavit plagas eorum: et baptizatus est ipse, et omnis domus ejus continuo.
34 Cumque perduxisset eos in domum suam, apposuit eis mensam, et lætatus est cum omni domo sua credens Deo.

35 Et cum dies factus esset, miserunt magistratus lictores, dicentes: Dimitte homines illos.
36 Nuntiavit autem custos carceris verba hæc Paulo: Quia miserunt magistratus ut dimittamini: nunc igitur exeuntes, ite in pace.
37 Paulus autem dixit eis: Cæsos nos publice, indemnatos homines Romanos, miserunt in carcerem: et nunc occulte nos ejiciunt? Non ita: sed veniant,
38 et ipsi nos ejiciant. Nuntiaverunt autem magistratibus lictores verba hæc. Timueruntque audito quod Romani essent:
39 et venientes deprecati sunt eos, et educentes rogabant ut egrederentur de urbe.
40 Exeuntes autem de carcere, introierunt ad Lydiam: et visis fratribus consolati sunt eos, et profecti sunt.


# Πράξεις τῶν Ἀποστόλων 16 (Textus Receptus)

1 Κατήντησεν δὲ [καὶ] εἰς Δέρβην καὶ εἰς Λύστραν. καὶ ἰδοὺ μαθητής τις ἦν ἐκεῖ ὀνόματι Τιμόθεος, υἱὸς γυναικὸς Ἰουδαίας πιστῆς πατρὸς δὲ Ἕλληνος,
2 ὃς ἐμαρτυρεῖτο ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν Λύστροις καὶ Ἰκονίῳ ἀδελφῶν.
3 τοῦτον ἠθέλησεν ὁ Παῦλος σὺν αὐτῷ ἐξελθεῖν, καὶ λαβὼν περιέτεμεν αὐτὸν διὰ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τοὺς ὄντας ἐν τοῖς τόποις ἐκείνοις, ᾔδεισαν γὰρ ἅπαντες ὅτι Ἕλλην ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ὑπῆρχεν.
4 Ὡς δὲ διεπορεύοντο τὰς πόλεις, παρεδίδοσαν αὐτοῖς φυλάσσειν τὰ δόγματα τὰ κεκριμένα ὑπὸ τῶν ἀποστόλων καὶ πρεσβυτέρων τῶν ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις.
5 Αἱ μὲν οὖν ἐκκλησίαι ἐστερεοῦντο τῇ πίστει καὶ ἐπερίσσευον τῷ ἀριθμῷ καθ' ἡμέραν.
6 διῆλθον δὲ τὴν Φρυγίαν καὶ Γαλατικὴν χώραν, κωλυθέντες ὑπὸ τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος λαλῆσαι τὸν λόγον ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ:
7 ἐλθόντες δὲ κατὰ τὴν Μυσίαν ἐπείραζον εἰς τὴν Βιθυνίαν πορευθῆναι, καὶ οὐκ εἴασεν αὐτοὺς τὸ πνεῦμα Ἰησοῦ:
8 παρελθόντες δὲ τὴν Μυσίαν κατέβησαν εἰς Τρῳάδα.

9 καὶ ὅραμα διὰ [τῆς] νυκτὸς τῷ Παύλῳ ὤφθη, ἀνὴρ Μακεδών τις ἦν ἑστὼς καὶ παρακαλῶν αὐτὸν καὶ λέγων, διαβὰς εἰς Μακεδονίαν βοήθησον ἡμῖν.
10 ὡς δὲ τὸ ὅραμα εἶδεν, εὐθέως ἐζητήσαμεν ἐξελθεῖν εἰς Μακεδονίαν, συμβιβάζοντες ὅτι προσκέκληται ἡμᾶς ὁ θεὸς εὐαγγελίσασθαι αὐτούς.
11 Ἀναχθέντες δὲ ἀπὸ Τρῳάδος εὐθυδρομήσαμεν εἰς Σαμοθρᾴκην, τῇ δὲ ἐπιούσῃ εἰς Νέαν Πόλιν
12 κἀκεῖθεν εἰς Φιλίππους, ἥτις ἐστὶν πρώτης μερίδος τῆς Μακεδονίας πόλις, κολωνία. ἦμεν δὲ ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ πόλει διατρίβοντες ἡμέρας τινάς.
13 τῇ τε ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων ἐξήλθομεν ἔξω τῆς πύλης παρὰ ποταμὸν οὗ ἐνομίζομεν προσευχὴν εἶναι, καὶ καθίσαντες ἐλαλοῦμεν ταῖς συνελθούσαις γυναιξίν.
14 καί τις γυνὴ ὀνόματι Λυδία, πορφυρόπωλις πόλεως Θυατείρων σεβομένη τὸν θεόν, ἤκουεν, ἧς ὁ κύριος διήνοιξεν τὴν καρδίαν προσέχειν τοῖς λαλουμένοις ὑπὸ τοῦ Παύλου.
15 ὡς δὲ ἐβαπτίσθη καὶ ὁ οἶκος αὐτῆς, παρεκάλεσεν λέγουσα, εἰ κεκρίκατέ με πιστὴν τῷ κυρίῳ εἶναι, εἰσελθόντες εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου μένετε: καὶ παρεβιάσατο ἡμᾶς.
16 Ἐγένετο δὲ πορευομένων ἡμῶν εἰς τὴν προσευχὴν παιδίσκην τινὰ ἔχουσαν πνεῦμα πύθωνα ὑπαντῆσαι ἡμῖν, ἥτις ἐργασίαν πολλὴν παρεῖχεν τοῖς κυρίοις αὐτῆς μαντευομένη.
17 αὕτη κατακολουθοῦσα τῷ Παύλῳ καὶ ἡμῖν ἔκραζεν λέγουσα, οὗτοι οἱ ἄνθρωποι δοῦλοι τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ὑψίστου εἰσίν, οἵτινες καταγγέλλουσιν ὑμῖν ὁδὸν σωτηρίας.
18 τοῦτο δὲ ἐποίει ἐπὶ πολλὰς ἡμέρας. διαπονηθεὶς δὲ Παῦλος καὶ ἐπιστρέψας τῷ πνεύματι εἶπεν: παραγγέλλω σοι ἐν ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐξελθεῖν ἀπ' αὐτῆς: καὶ ἐξῆλθεν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ.

19 ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ κύριοι αὐτῆς ὅτι ἐξῆλθεν ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς ἐργασίας αὐτῶν ἐπιλαβόμενοι τὸν Παῦλον καὶ τὸν Σιλᾶν εἵλκυσαν εἰς τὴν ἀγορὰν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας,
20 καὶ προσαγαγόντες αὐτοὺς τοῖς στρατηγοῖς εἶπαν: οὗτοι οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἐκταράσσουσιν ἡμῶν τὴν πόλιν Ἰουδαῖοι ὑπάρχοντες,
21 καὶ καταγγέλλουσιν ἔθη ἃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν ἡμῖν παραδέχεσθαι οὐδὲ ποιεῖν Ῥωμαίοις οὖσιν.
22 καὶ συνεπέστη ὁ ὄχλος κατ' αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ στρατηγοὶ περιρήξαντες αὐτῶν τὰ ἱμάτια ἐκέλευον ῥαβδίζειν,
23 πολλάς τε ἐπιθέντες αὐτοῖς πληγὰς ἔβαλον εἰς φυλακήν, παραγγείλαντες τῷ δεσμοφύλακι ἀσφαλῶς τηρεῖν αὐτούς:
24 ὃς παραγγελίαν τοιαύτην λαβὼν ἔβαλεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν ἐσωτέραν φυλακὴν καὶ τοὺς πόδας ἠσφαλίσατο αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ ξύλον.
25 κατὰ δὲ τὸ μεσονύκτιον Παῦλος καὶ Σιλᾶς προσευχόμενοι ὕμνουν τὸν θεόν, ἐπηκροῶντο δὲ αὐτῶν οἱ δέσμιοι:
26 ἄφνω δὲ σεισμὸς ἐγένετο μέγας ὥστε σαλευθῆναι τὰ θεμέλια τοῦ δεσμωτηρίου, ἠνεῴχθησαν δὲ παραχρῆμα αἱ θύραι πᾶσαι, καὶ πάντων τὰ δεσμὰ ἀνέθη.
27 ἔξυπνος δὲ γενόμενος ὁ δεσμοφύλαξ καὶ ἰδὼν ἀνεῳγμένας τὰς θύρας τῆς φυλακῆς, σπασάμενος [τὴν] μάχαιραν ἤμελλεν ἑαυτὸν ἀναιρεῖν, νομίζων ἐκπεφευγέναι τοὺς δεσμίους.
28 ἐφώνησεν δὲ μεγάλῃ φωνῇ ὁ Παῦλος λέγων, μηδὲν πράξῃς σεαυτῷ κακόν, ἅπαντες γάρ ἐσμεν ἐνθάδε.
29 αἰτήσας δὲ φῶτα εἰσεπήδησεν, καὶ ἔντρομος γενόμενος προσέπεσεν τῷ Παύλῳ καὶ τῷ Σιλᾷ,
30 καὶ προαγαγὼν αὐτοὺς ἔξω ἔφη, κύριοι, τί με δεῖ ποιεῖν ἵνα σωθῶ;
31 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν: πίστευσον ἐπὶ τὸν κύριον Ἰησοῦν, καὶ σωθήσῃ σὺ καὶ ὁ οἶκός σου.
32 καὶ ἐλάλησαν αὐτῷ τὸν λόγον τοῦ κυρίου σὺν πᾶσιν τοῖς ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ.
33 καὶ παραλαβὼν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ τῆς νυκτὸς ἔλουσεν ἀπὸ τῶν πληγῶν, καὶ ἐβαπτίσθη αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ αὐτοῦ πάντες παραχρῆμα,
34 ἀναγαγών τε αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν οἶκον παρέθηκεν τράπεζαν, καὶ ἠγαλλιάσατο πανοικεὶ πεπιστευκὼς τῷ θεῷ.

35 Ἡμέρας δὲ γενομένης ἀπέστειλαν οἱ στρατηγοὶ τοὺς ῥαβδούχους λέγοντες, ἀπόλυσον τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἐκείνους.
36 ἀπήγγειλεν δὲ ὁ δεσμοφύλαξ τοὺς λόγους τούτους πρὸς τὸν Παῦλον, ὅτι ἀπέσταλκαν οἱ στρατηγοὶ ἵνα ἀπολυθῆτε: νῦν οὖν ἐξελθόντες πορεύεσθε ἐν εἰρήνῃ.
37 ὁ δὲ Παῦλος ἔφη πρὸς αὐτούς, δείραντες ἡμᾶς δημοσίᾳ ἀκατακρίτους, ἀνθρώπους Ῥωμαίους ὑπάρχοντας, ἔβαλαν εἰς φυλακήν: καὶ νῦν λάθρᾳ ἡμᾶς ἐκβάλλουσιν; οὐ γάρ, ἀλλὰ ἐλθόντες αὐτοὶ ἡμᾶς ἐξαγαγέτωσαν.
38 ἀπήγγειλαν δὲ τοῖς στρατηγοῖς οἱ ῥαβδοῦχοι τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα. ἐφοβήθησαν δὲ ἀκούσαντες ὅτι Ῥωμαῖοί εἰσιν,
39 καὶ ἐλθόντες παρεκάλεσαν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐξαγαγόντες ἠρώτων ἀπελθεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως.
40 ἐξελθόντες δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς φυλακῆς εἰσῆλθον πρὸς τὴν Λυδίαν, καὶ ἰδόντες παρεκάλεσαν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς καὶ ἐξῆλθαν.
