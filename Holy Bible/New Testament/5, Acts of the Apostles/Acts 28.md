# Acts of the Apostles 28 (RSVCE)

### Paul on the Island of Malta
1 After we had escaped, we then learned that the island was called Malta.
2 And the natives showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.
3 Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, when a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.
4 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.”
5 He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.
6 They waited, expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead; but when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
7 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
8 It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery; and Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him.
9 And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.
10 They presented many gifts to us; and when we sailed, they put on board whatever we needed.
### Paul Arrives at Rome
11 After three months we set sail in a ship which had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the Twin Brothers as figurehead.
12 Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
13 And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rheʹgium; and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteʹoli.
14 There we found brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.
15 And the brethren there, when they heard of us, came as far as the Forum of Apʹpius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage.
16 And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier that guarded him.
### Paul and Jewish Leaders in Rome
17 After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews; and when they had gathered, he said to them, “Brethren, though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
18 When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.
19 But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar—though I had no charge to bring against my nation.
20 For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”
21 And they said to him, “We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brethren coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you.
22 But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against.”
### Paul Preaches in Rome
23 When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in great numbers. And he expounded the matter to them from morning till evening, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets.
24 And some were convinced by what he said, while others disbelieved.
25 So, as they disagreed among themselves, they departed, after Paul had made one statement: “The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:
26 ‘Go to this people, and say, You shall indeed hear but never understand, and you shall indeed see but never perceive.
27 For this people’s heart has grown dull, and their ears are heavy of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should perceive with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal them.’
28 Let it be known to you then that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen.”
30 And he lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him,
31 preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ quite openly and unhindered.


# Actus Apostolorum 28 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et cum evasissemus, tunc cognovimus quia Melita insula vocabatur. Barbari vero præstabant non modicam humanitatem nobis.
2 Accensa enim pyra, reficiebant nos omnes propter imbrem qui imminebat, et frigus.
3 Cum congregasset autem Paulus sarmentorum aliquantam multitudinem, et imposuisset super ignem, vipera a calore cum processisset, invasit manum ejus.
4 Ut vero viderunt barbari pendentem bestiam de manu ejus, ad invicem dicebant: Utique homicida est homo hic, qui cum evaserit de mari, ultio non sinit eum vivere.
5 Et ille quidem excutiens bestiam in ignem, nihil mali passus est.
6 At illi existimabant eum in tumorem convertendum, et subito casurum et mori. Diu autem illis exspectantibus, et videntibus nihil mali in eo fieri, convertentes se, dicebant eum esse deum.
7 In locis autem illis erant prædia principis insulæ, nomine Publii, qui nos suscipiens, triduo benigne exhibuit.
8 Contigit autem patrem Publii febribus et dysenteria vexatum jacere. Ad quem Paulus intravit: et cum orasset, et imposuisset ei manus, salvavit eum.
9 Quo facto, omnes qui in insula habebant infirmitates, accedebant, et curabantur:
10 qui etiam multis honoribus nos honoraverunt, et navigantibus imposuerunt quæ necessaria erant.

11 Post menses autem tres navigavimus in navi Alexandrina, quæ in insula hiemaverat, cui erat insigne Castorum.
12 Et cum venissemus Syracusam, mansimus ibi triduo.
13 Inde circumlegentes devenimus Rhegium: et post unum diem, flante austro, secunda die venimus Puteolos:
14 ubi inventis fratribus rogati sumus manere apud eos dies septem: et sic venimus Romam.
15 Et inde cum audissent fratres, occurrerunt nobis usque ad Appii forum, ac tres Tabernas. Quos cum vidisset Paulus, gratias agens Deo, accepit fiduciam.

16 Cum autem venissemus Romam, permissum est Paulo manere sibimet cum custodiente se milite.
17 Post tertium autem diem convocavit primos Judæorum. Cumque convenissent, dicebat eis: Ego, viri fratres, nihil adversus plebem faciens, aut morem paternum, vinctus ab Jerosolymis traditus sum in manus Romanorum,
18 qui cum interrogationem de me habuissent, voluerunt me dimittere, eo quod nulla esset causa mortis in me.
19 Contradicentibus autem Judæis, coactus sum appellare Cæsarem, non quasi gentem meam habens aliquid accusare.
20 Propter hanc igitur causam rogavi vos videre, et alloqui. Propter spem enim Israël catena hac circumdatus sum.
21 At illi dixerunt ad eum: Nos neque litteras accepimus de te a Judæa, neque adveniens aliquis fratrum nuntiavit, aut locutus est quid de te malum.
22 Rogamus autem a te audire quæ sentis: nam de secta hac notum est nobis quia ubique ei contradicitur.

23 Cum constituissent autem illi diem, venerunt ad eum in hospitium plurimi, quibus exponebat testificans regnum Dei, suadensque eis de Jesu ex lege Moysi et prophetis a mane usque ad vesperam.
24 Et quidam credebant his quæ dicebantur: quidam vero non credebant.
25 Cumque invicem non essent consentientes, discedebant, dicente Paulo unum verbum: Quia bene Spiritus Sanctus locutus est per Isaiam prophetam ad patres nostros,
26 dicens: Vade ad populum istum, et dic ad eos:Aure audietis, et non intelligetis,et videntes videbitis, et non perspicietis.
27 Incrassatum est enim cor populi hujus,et auribus graviter audierunt,et oculos suos compresserunt:ne forte videant oculis,et auribus audiant,et corde intelligant, et convertantur,et sanem eos.
28 Notum ergo sit vobis, quoniam gentibus missum est hoc salutare Dei, et ipsi audient.

29 Et cum hæc dixisset, exierunt ab eo Judæi, multam habentes inter se quæstionem.
30 Mansit autem biennio toto in suo conducto: et suscipiebat omnes qui ingrediebantur ad eum,
31 prædicans regnum Dei, et docens quæ sunt de Domino Jesu Christo cum omni fiducia, sine prohibitione.


# Πράξεις τῶν Ἀποστόλων 28 (Textus Receptus)

1 Καὶ διασωθέντες τότε ἐπέγνωμεν ὅτι Μελίτη ἡ νῆσος καλεῖται.
2 οἵ τε βάρβαροι παρεῖχον οὐ τὴν τυχοῦσαν φιλανθρωπίαν ἡμῖν, ἅψαντες γὰρ πυρὰν προσελάβοντο πάντας ἡμᾶς διὰ τὸν ὑετὸν τὸν ἐφεστῶτα καὶ διὰ τὸ ψῦχος.
3 συστρέψαντος δὲ τοῦ Παύλου φρυγάνων τι πλῆθος καὶ ἐπιθέντος ἐπὶ τὴν πυράν, ἔχιδνα ἀπὸ τῆς θέρμης ἐξελθοῦσα καθῆψεν τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ.
4 ὡς δὲ εἶδον οἱ βάρβαροι κρεμάμενον τὸ θηρίον ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἔλεγον, πάντως φονεύς ἐστιν ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗτος ὃν διασωθέντα ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης ἡ δίκη ζῆν οὐκ εἴασεν.
5 ὁ μὲν οὖν ἀποτινάξας τὸ θηρίον εἰς τὸ πῦρ ἔπαθεν οὐδὲν κακόν:
6 οἱ δὲ προσεδόκων αὐτὸν μέλλειν πίμπρασθαι ἢ καταπίπτειν ἄφνω νεκρόν. ἐπὶ πολὺ δὲ αὐτῶν προσδοκώντων καὶ θεωρούντων μηδὲν ἄτοπον εἰς αὐτὸν γινόμενον, μεταβαλόμενοι ἔλεγον αὐτὸν εἶναι θεόν.
7 ἐν δὲ τοῖς περὶ τὸν τόπον ἐκεῖνον ὑπῆρχεν χωρία τῷ πρώτῳ τῆς νήσου ὀνόματι Ποπλίῳ, ὃς ἀναδεξάμενος ἡμᾶς τρεῖς ἡμέρας φιλοφρόνως ἐξένισεν.
8 ἐγένετο δὲ τὸν πατέρα τοῦ Ποπλίου πυρετοῖς καὶ δυσεντερίῳ συνεχόμενον κατακεῖσθαι, πρὸς ὃν ὁ Παῦλος εἰσελθὼν καὶ προσευξάμενος, ἐπιθεὶς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῷ ἰάσατο αὐτόν.
9 τούτου δὲ γενομένου καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ἔχοντες ἀσθενείας προσήρχοντο καὶ ἐθεραπεύοντο,
10 οἳ καὶ πολλαῖς τιμαῖς ἐτίμησαν ἡμᾶς καὶ ἀναγομένοις ἐπέθεντο τὰ πρὸς τὰς χρείας.

11 Μετὰ δὲ τρεῖς μῆνας ἀνήχθημεν ἐν πλοίῳ παρακεχειμακότι ἐν τῇ νήσῳ Ἀλεξανδρίνῳ, παρασήμῳ Διοσκούροις.
12 καὶ καταχθέντες εἰς Συρακούσας ἐπεμείναμεν ἡμέρας τρεῖς,
13 ὅθεν περιελόντες κατηντήσαμεν εἰς Ῥήγιον. καὶ μετὰ μίαν ἡμέραν ἐπιγενομένου νότου δευτεραῖοι ἤλθομεν εἰς Ποτιόλους,
14 οὗ εὑρόντες ἀδελφοὺς παρεκλήθημεν παρ' αὐτοῖς ἐπιμεῖναι ἡμέρας ἑπτά: καὶ οὕτως εἰς τὴν Ῥώμην ἤλθαμεν.
15 κἀκεῖθεν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἀκούσαντες τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν ἦλθαν εἰς ἀπάντησιν ἡμῖν ἄχρι Ἀππίου Φόρου καὶ Τριῶν Ταβερνῶν οὓς ἰδὼν ὁ Παῦλος εὐχαριστήσας τῷ θεῷ ἔλαβε θάρσος.

16 Ὅτε δὲ εἰσήλθομεν εἰς Ῥώμην, ἐπετράπη τῷ Παύλῳ μένειν καθ' ἑαυτὸν σὺν τῷ φυλάσσοντι αὐτὸν στρατιώτῃ.
17 ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ ἡμέρας τρεῖς συγκαλέσασθαι αὐτὸν τοὺς ὄντας τῶν Ἰουδαίων πρώτους: συνελθόντων δὲ αὐτῶν ἔλεγεν πρὸς αὐτούς: ἐγώ, ἄνδρες ἀδελφοί, οὐδὲν ἐναντίον ποιήσας τῷ λαῷ ἢ τοῖς ἔθεσι τοῖς πατρῴοις, δέσμιος ἐξ Ἱεροσολύμων παρεδόθην εἰς τὰς χεῖρας τῶν Ῥωμαίων,
18 οἵτινες ἀνακρίναντές με ἐβούλοντο ἀπολῦσαι διὰ τὸ μηδεμίαν αἰτίαν θανάτου ὑπάρχειν ἐν ἐμοί:
19 ἀντιλεγόντων δὲ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἠναγκάσθην ἐπικαλέσασθαι Καίσαρα, οὐχ ὡς τοῦ ἔθνους μου ἔχων τι κατηγορεῖν.
20 διὰ ταύτην οὖν τὴν αἰτίαν παρεκάλεσα ὑμᾶς ἰδεῖν καὶ προσλαλῆσαι: ἕνεκεν γὰρ τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ τὴν ἅλυσιν ταύτην περίκειμαι.
21 οἱ δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν εἶπαν, ἡμεῖς οὔτε γράμματα περὶ σοῦ ἐδεξάμεθα ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰουδαίας, οὔτε παραγενόμενός τις τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἀπήγγειλεν ἢ ἐλάλησέν τι περὶ σοῦ πονηρόν.
22 ἀξιοῦμεν δὲ παρὰ σοῦ ἀκοῦσαι ἃ φρονεῖς, περὶ μὲν γὰρ τῆς αἱρέσεως ταύτης γνωστὸν ἡμῖν ἐστιν ὅτι πανταχοῦ ἀντιλέγεται.

23 ταξάμενοι δὲ αὐτῷ ἡμέραν ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν ξενίαν πλείονες, οἷς ἐξετίθετο διαμαρτυρόμενος τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ πείθων τε αὐτοὺς περὶ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἀπό τε τοῦ νόμου Μωϋσέως καὶ τῶν προφητῶν ἀπὸ πρωῒ ἕως ἑσπέρας.
24 καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐπείθοντο τοῖς λεγομένοις, οἱ δὲ ἠπίστουν:
25 ἀσύμφωνοι δὲ ὄντες πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀπελύοντο, εἰπόντος τοῦ Παύλου ῥῆμα ἓν ὅτι καλῶς τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον ἐλάλησεν διὰ Ἠσαΐου τοῦ προφήτου πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν
26 λέγων, πορεύθητι πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον καὶ εἰπόν, ἀκοῇ ἀκούσετε καὶ οὐ μὴ συνῆτε, καὶ βλέποντες βλέψετε καὶ οὐ μὴ ἴδητε:
27 ἐπαχύνθη γὰρ ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν βαρέως ἤκουσαν, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν ἐκάμμυσαν: μήποτε ἴδωσιν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν ἀκούσωσιν καὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ συνῶσιν καὶ ἐπιστρέψωσιν, καὶ ἰάσομαι αὐτούς.
28 γνωστὸν οὖν ἔστω ὑμῖν ὅτι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἀπεστάλη τοῦτο τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ θεοῦ: αὐτοὶ καὶ ἀκούσονται.

29 
30 ἐνέμεινεν δὲ διετίαν ὅλην ἐν ἰδίῳ μισθώματι, καὶ ἀπεδέχετο πάντας τοὺς εἰσπορευομένους πρὸς αὐτόν,
31 κηρύσσων τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ διδάσκων τὰ περὶ τοῦ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ μετὰ πάσης παρρησίας ἀκωλύτως.
