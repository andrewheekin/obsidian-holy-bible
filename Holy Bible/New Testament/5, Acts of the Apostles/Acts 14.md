# Acts of the Apostles 14 (RSVCE)

### Paul and Barnabas in Iconium
1 Now at Icoʹnium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue, and so spoke that a great company believed, both of Jews and of Greeks.
2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren.
3 So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
4 But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
5 When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to molest them and to stone them,
6 they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaoʹnia, and to the surrounding country;
7 and there they preached the gospel.
### Paul and Barnabas in Lystra and Derbe
8 Now at Lystra there was a man sitting, who could not use his feet; he was a cripple from birth, who had never walked.
9 He listened to Paul speaking; and Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,
10 said in a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.” And he sprang up and walked.
11 And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaoʹnian, “The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!”
12 Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, because he was the chief speaker, they called Hermes.
13 And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the people.
14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out among the multitude, crying,
15 “Men, why are you doing this? We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.
16 In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways;
17 yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.”
18 With these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.
### The Return to Antioch in Syria
19 But Jews came there from Antioch and Icoʹnium; and having persuaded the people, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
20 But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city; and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.
21 When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Icoʹnium and to Antioch,
22 strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.
23 And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting, they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed.
24 Then they passed through Pisidʹia, and came to Pamphylʹia.
25 And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attaliʹa;
26 and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.
27 And when they arrived, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
28 And they remained no little time with the disciples.


# Actus Apostolorum 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Factum est autem Iconii, ut simul introirent in synagogam Judæorum, et loquerentur, ita ut crederet Judæorum et Græcorum copiosa multitudo.
2 Qui vero increduli fuerunt Judæi, suscitaverunt et ad iracundiam concitaverunt animas gentium adversus fratres.
3 Multo igitur tempore demorati sunt, fiducialiter agentes in Domino, testimonium perhibente verbo gratiæ suæ, dante signa et prodigia fieri per manus eorum.
4 Divisa est autem multitudo civitatis: et quidam quidem erant cum Judæis, quidam vero cum Apostolis.
5 Cum autem factus esset impetus gentilium et Judæorum cum principibus suis, ut contumeliis afficerent, et lapidarent eos,
6 intelligentes confugerunt ad civitates Lycaoniæ Lystram et Derben, et universam in circuitu regionem, et ibi evangelizantes erant.
7 Et quidam vir Lystris infirmus pedibus sedebat, claudus ex utero matris suæ, qui numquam ambulaverat.
8 Hic audivit Paulum loquentem. Qui intuitus eum, et videns quia fidem haberet ut salvus fieret,
9 dixit magna voce: Surge super pedes tuos rectus. Et exilivit, et ambulabat.

10 Turbæ autem cum vidissent quod fecerat Paulus, levaverunt vocem suam lycaonice, dicentes: Dii similes facti hominibus descenderunt ad nos.
11 Et vocabant Barnabam Jovem, Paulum vero Mercurium: quoniam ipse erat dux verbi.
12 Sacerdos quoque Jovis, qui erat ante civitatem, tauros et coronas ante januas afferens, cum populis volebat sacrificare.

13 Quod ubi audierunt Apostoli, Barnabas et Paulus, conscissis tunicis suis exilierunt in turbas, clamantes
14 et dicentes: Viri, quid hæc facitis? et nos mortales sumus, similes vobis homines, annuntiantes vobis ab his vanis converti ad Deum vivum, qui fecit cælum, et terram, et mare, et omnia quæ in eis sunt:
15 qui in præteritis generationibus dimisit omnes gentes ingredi vias suas.
16 Et quidem non sine testimonio semetipsum reliquit benefaciens de cælo, dans pluvias et tempora fructifera, implens cibo et lætitia corda nostra.
17 Et hæc dicentes, vix sedaverunt turbas ne sibi immolarent.

18 Supervenerunt autem quidam ab Antiochia et Iconio Judæi: et persuasis turbis, lapidantesque Paulum, traxerunt extra civitatem, existimantes eum mortuum esse.
19 Circumdantibus autem eum discipulis, surgens intravit civitatem, et postera die profectus est cum Barnaba in Derben.
20 Cumque evangelizassent civitati illi, et docuissent multos, reversi sunt Lystram, et Iconium, et Antiochiam,
21 confirmantes animas discipulorum, exhortantesque ut permanerent in fide: et quoniam per multas tribulationes oportet nos intrare in regnum Dei.
22 Et cum constituissent illis per singulas ecclesias presbyteros, et orassent cum jejunationibus, commendaverunt eos Domino, in quem crediderunt.
23 Transeuntesque Pisidiam, venerunt in Pamphyliam,
24 et loquentes verbum Domini in Perge, descenderunt in Attaliam:
25 et inde navigaverunt Antiochiam, unde erant traditi gratiæ Dei in opus quod compleverunt.
26 Cum autem venissent, et congregassent ecclesiam, retulerunt quanta fecisset Deus cum illis, et quia aperuisset gentibus ostium fidei.
27 Morati sunt autem tempus non modicum cum discipulis.


# Πράξεις τῶν Ἀποστόλων 14 (Textus Receptus)

1 Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν Ἰκονίῳ κατὰ τὸ αὐτὸ εἰσελθεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν συναγωγὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ λαλῆσαι οὕτως ὥστε πιστεῦσαι Ἰουδαίων τε καὶ Ἑλλήνων πολὺ πλῆθος.
2 οἱ δὲ ἀπειθήσαντες Ἰουδαῖοι ἐπήγειραν καὶ ἐκάκωσαν τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν ἐθνῶν κατὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν.
3 ἱκανὸν μὲν οὖν χρόνον διέτριψαν παρρησιαζόμενοι ἐπὶ τῷ κυρίῳ τῷ μαρτυροῦντι ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ τῆς χάριτος αὐτοῦ, διδόντι σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα γίνεσθαι διὰ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν.
4 ἐσχίσθη δὲ τὸ πλῆθος τῆς πόλεως, καὶ οἱ μὲν ἦσαν σὺν τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις οἱ δὲ σὺν τοῖς ἀποστόλοις.
5 ὡς δὲ ἐγένετο ὁρμὴ τῶν ἐθνῶν τε καὶ Ἰουδαίων σὺν τοῖς ἄρχουσιν αὐτῶν ὑβρίσαι καὶ λιθοβολῆσαι αὐτούς,
6 συνιδόντες κατέφυγον εἰς τὰς πόλεις τῆς Λυκαονίας Λύστραν καὶ Δέρβην καὶ τὴν περίχωρον,
7 κἀκεῖ εὐαγγελιζόμενοι ἦσαν. Καί τις ἀνὴρ ἀδύνατος ἐν Λύστροις τοῖς ποσὶν ἐκάθητο, χωλὸς ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, ὃς οὐδέποτε περιεπάτησεν.
8 οὗτος ἤκουσεν τοῦ Παύλου λαλοῦντος, ὃς ἀτενίσας αὐτῷ καὶ ἰδὼν ὅτι ἔχει πίστιν τοῦ σωθῆναι,
9 εἶπεν μεγάλῃ φωνῇ: ἀνάστηθι ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας σου ὀρθός. καὶ ἥλατο καὶ περιεπάτει.

10 οἵ τε ὄχλοι ἰδόντες ὃ ἐποίησεν Παῦλος ἐπῆραν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν Λυκαονιστὶ λέγοντες, οἱ θεοὶ ὁμοιωθέντες ἀνθρώποις κατέβησαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς:
11 ἐκάλουν τε τὸν Βαρναβᾶν Δία, τὸν δὲ Παῦλον Ἑρμῆν, ἐπειδὴ αὐτὸς ἦν ὁ ἡγούμενος τοῦ λόγου.
12 ὅ τε ἱερεὺς τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ ὄντος πρὸ τῆς πόλεως ταύρους καὶ στέμματα ἐπὶ τοὺς πυλῶνας ἐνέγκας σὺν τοῖς ὄχλοις ἤθελεν θύειν.

13 ἀκούσαντες δὲ οἱ ἀπόστολοι Βαρναβᾶς καὶ Παῦλος, διαρρήξαντες τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν ἐξεπήδησαν εἰς τὸν ὄχλον, κράζοντες
14 καὶ λέγοντες, ἄνδρες, τί ταῦτα ποιεῖτε; καὶ ἡμεῖς ὁμοιοπαθεῖς ἐσμεν ὑμῖν ἄνθρωποι, εὐαγγελιζόμενοι ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ τούτων τῶν ματαίων ἐπιστρέφειν ἐπὶ θεὸν ζῶντα ὃς ἐποίησεν τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς:
15 ὃς ἐν ταῖς παρῳχημέναις γενεαῖς εἴασεν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη πορεύεσθαι ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν:
16 καίτοι οὐκ ἀμάρτυρον αὐτὸν ἀφῆκεν ἀγαθουργῶν, οὐρανόθεν ὑμῖν ὑετοὺς διδοὺς καὶ καιροὺς καρποφόρους, ἐμπιπλῶν τροφῆς καὶ εὐφροσύνης τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν.
17 καὶ ταῦτα λέγοντες μόλις κατέπαυσαν τοὺς ὄχλους τοῦ μὴ θύειν αὐτοῖς.

18 Ἐπῆλθαν δὲ ἀπὸ Ἀντιοχείας καὶ Ἰκονίου Ἰουδαῖοι, καὶ πείσαντες τοὺς ὄχλους καὶ λιθάσαντες τὸν Παῦλον ἔσυρον ἔξω τῆς πόλεως, νομίζοντες αὐτὸν τεθνηκέναι.
19 κυκλωσάντων δὲ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτὸν ἀναστὰς εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν. καὶ τῇ ἐπαύριον ἐξῆλθεν σὺν τῷ Βαρναβᾷ εἰς Δέρβην.
20 εὐαγγελισάμενοί τε τὴν πόλιν ἐκείνην καὶ μαθητεύσαντες ἱκανοὺς ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς τὴν Λύστραν καὶ εἰς Ἰκόνιον καὶ εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν,
21 ἐπιστηρίζοντες τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν μαθητῶν, παρακαλοῦντες ἐμμένειν τῇ πίστει, καὶ ὅτι διὰ πολλῶν θλίψεων δεῖ ἡμᾶς εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ.
22 χειροτονήσαντες δὲ αὐτοῖς κατ' ἐκκλησίαν πρεσβυτέρους προσευξάμενοι μετὰ νηστειῶν παρέθεντο αὐτοὺς τῷ κυρίῳ εἰς ὃν πεπιστεύκεισαν.
23 καὶ διελθόντες τὴν Πισιδίαν ἦλθον εἰς τὴν Παμφυλίαν,
24 καὶ λαλήσαντες ἐν Πέργῃ τὸν λόγον κατέβησαν εἰς Ἀττάλειαν.
25 κἀκεῖθεν ἀπέπλευσαν εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν, ὅθεν ἦσαν παραδεδομένοι τῇ χάριτι τοῦ θεοῦ εἰς τὸ ἔργον ὃ ἐπλήρωσαν.
26 παραγενόμενοι δὲ καὶ συναγαγόντες τὴν ἐκκλησίαν ἀνήγγελλον ὅσα ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς μετ' αὐτῶν καὶ ὅτι ἤνοιξεν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν θύραν πίστεως.
27 διέτριβον δὲ χρόνον οὐκ ὀλίγον σὺν τοῖς μαθηταῖς.
