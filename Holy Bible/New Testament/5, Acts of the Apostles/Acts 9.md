# Acts of the Apostles 9 (RSVCE)

### The Conversion of Saul
1 But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
3 Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him.
4 And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”
5 And he said, “Who are you, Lord?” And he said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;
6 but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.”
7 The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
8 Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
9 And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
10 Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananiʹas. The Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananiʹas.” And he said, “Here I am, Lord.”
11 And the Lord said to him, “Rise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying,
12 and he has seen a man named Ananiʹas come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.”
13 But Ananiʹas answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem;
14 and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name.”
15 But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;
16 for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.”
17 So Ananiʹas departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized,
### Saul Preaches in Damascus
19 and took food and was strengthened. For several days he was with the disciples at Damascus.
20 And in the synagogues immediately he proclaimed Jesus, saying, “He is the Son of God.”
21 And all who heard him were amazed, and said, “Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name? And he has come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests.”
22 But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.
### Saul Escapes from the Jews
23 When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,
24 but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night, to kill him;
25 but his disciples took him by night and let him down over the wall, lowering him in a basket.
### Saul in Jerusalem
26 And when he had come to Jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.
27 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
28 So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem,
29 preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists; but they were seeking to kill him.
30 And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesareʹa, and sent him off to Tarsus.
31 So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samarʹia had peace and was built up; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it was multiplied.
### The Healing of Aeneas
32 Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints that lived at Lydda.
33 There he found a man named Aeneʹas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed.
34 And Peter said to him, “Aeneʹas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.” And immediately he rose.
35 And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
### Peter in Lydda and Joppa
36 Now there was at Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which means Dorcas or Gazelle. She was full of good works and acts of charity.
37 In those days she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.
38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him entreating him, “Please come to us without delay.”
39 So Peter rose and went with them. And when he had come, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping, and showing coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them.
40 But Peter put them all outside and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, “Tabitha, rise.” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.
41 And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.
42 And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
43 And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.


# Actus Apostolorum 9 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Saulus autem adhuc spirans minarum et cædis in discipulos Domini, accessit ad principem sacerdotum,
2 et petiit ab eo epistolas in Damascum ad synagogas: ut si quos invenisset hujus viæ viros ac mulieres, vinctos perduceret in Jerusalem.
3 Et cum iter faceret, contigit ut appropinquaret Damasco: et subito circumfulsit eum lux de cælo.
4 Et cadens in terram audivit vocem dicentem sibi: Saule, Saule, quid me persequeris?
5 Qui dixit: Quis es, domine? Et ille: Ego sum Jesus, quem tu persequeris: durum est tibi contra stimulum calcitrare.
6 Et tremens ac stupens dixit: Domine, quid me vis facere?
7 Et Dominus ad eum: Surge, et ingredere civitatem, et ibi dicetur tibi quid te oporteat facere. Viri autem illi qui comitabantur cum eo, stabant stupefacti, audientes quidem vocem, neminem autem videntes.
8 Surrexit autem Saulus de terra, apertisque oculis nihil videbat. Ad manus autem illum trahentes, introduxerunt Damascum.
9 Et erat ibi tribus diebus non videns, et non manducavit, neque bibit.

10 Erat autem quidam discipulus Damasci, nomine Ananias: et dixit ad illum in visu Dominus: Anania. At ille ait: Ecce ego, Domine.
11 Et Dominus ad eum: Surge, et vade in vicum qui vocatur Rectus: et quære in domo Judæ Saulum nomine Tarsensem: ecce enim orat.
12 (Et vidit virum Ananiam nomine, introëuntem, et imponentem sibi manus ut visum recipiat.)
13 Respondit autem Ananias: Domine, audivi a multis de viro hoc, quanta mala fecerit sanctis tuis in Jerusalem:
14 et hic habet potestatem a principibus sacerdotum alligandi omnes qui invocant nomen tuum.
15 Dixit autem ad eum Dominus: Vade, quoniam vas electionis est mihi iste, ut portet nomen meum coram gentibus, et regibus, et filiis Israël.
16 Ego enim ostendam illi quanta oporteat eum pro nomine meo pati.
17 Et abiit Ananias, et introivit in domum: et imponens ei manus, dixit: Saule frater, Dominus misit me Jesus, qui apparuit tibi in via qua veniebas, ut videas, et implearis Spiritu Sancto.
18 Et confestim ceciderunt ab oculis ejus tamquam squamæ, et visum recepit: et surgens baptizatus est.
19 Et cum accepisset cibum, confortatus est.Fuit autem cum discipulis qui erant Damasci per dies aliquot.
20 Et continuo in synagogis prædicabat Jesum, quoniam hic est Filius Dei.
21 Stupebant autem omnes qui audiebant, et dicebant: Nonne hic est qui expugnabat in Jerusalem eos qui invocabant nomen istud: et huc ad hoc venit, ut vinctos illos duceret ad principes sacerdotum?
22 Saulus autem multo magis convalescebat, et confundebat Judæos qui habitabant Damasci, affirmans quoniam hic est Christus.

23 Cum autem implerentur dies multi, consilium fecerunt in unum Judæi ut eum interficerent.
24 Notæ autem factæ sunt Saulo insidiæ eorum. Custodiebant autem et portas die ac nocte, ut eum interficerent.
25 Accipientes autem eum discipuli nocte, per murum dimiserunt eum, submittentes in sporta.
26 Cum autem venisset in Jerusalem, tentabat se jungere discipulis, et omnes timebant eum, non credentes quod esset discipulus.
27 Barnabas autem apprehensum illum duxit ad Apostolos: et narravit illis quomodo in via vidisset Dominum, et quia locutus est ei, et quomodo in Damasco fiducialiter egerit in nomine Jesu.
28 Et erat cum illis intrans et exiens in Jerusalem, et fiducialiter agens in nomine Domini.
29 Loquebatur quoque gentibus, et disputabat cum Græcis: illi autem quærebant occidere eum.
30 Quod cum cognovissent fratres, deduxerunt eum Cæsaream, et dimiserunt Tarsum.

31 Ecclesia quidem per totam Judæam, et Galilæam, et Samariam habebat pacem, et ædificabatur ambulans in timore Domini, et consolatione Sancti Spiritus replebatur.
32 Factum est autem, ut Petrus dum pertransiret universos, deveniret ad sanctos qui habitabant Lyddæ.
33 Invenit autem ibi hominem quemdam, nomine Æneam, ab annis octo jacentem in grabato, qui erat paralyticus.
34 Et ait illi Petrus: Ænea, sanat te Dominus Jesus Christus: surge, et sterne tibi. Et continuo surrexit.
35 Et viderunt eum omnes qui habitabant Lyddæ et Saronæ: qui conversi sunt ad Dominum.
36 In Joppe autem fuit quædam discipula, nomine Tabitha, quæ interpretata dicitur Dorcas. Hæc erat plena operibus bonis et eleemosynis quas faciebat.
37 Factum est autem in diebus illis ut infirmata moreretur. Quam cum lavissent, posuerunt eam in cœnaculo.
38 Cum autem prope esset Lydda ad Joppen, discipuli, audientes quia Petrus esset in ea, miserunt duos viros ad eum, rogantes: Ne pigriteris venire ad nos.
39 Exsurgens autem Petrus, venit cum illis. Et cum advenisset, duxerunt illum in cœnaculum: et circumsteterunt illum omnes viduæ flentes, et ostendentes ei tunicas et vestes quas faciebat illis Dorcas.
40 Ejectis autem omnibus foras, Petrus ponens genua oravit: et conversus ad corpus, dixit: Tabitha, surge. At illa aperuit oculos suos: et viso Petro, resedit.
41 Dans autem illi manum, erexit eam. Et cum vocasset sanctos et viduas, assignavit eam vivam.
42 Notum autem factum est per universam Joppen: et crediderunt multi in Domino.
43 Factum est autem ut dies multos moraretur in Joppe, apud Simonem quemdam coriarium.


# Πράξεις τῶν Ἀποστόλων 9 (Textus Receptus)

1 Ὁ δὲ Σαῦλος, ἔτι ἐμπνέων ἀπειλῆς καὶ φόνου εἰς τοὺς μαθητὰς τοῦ κυρίου, προσελθὼν τῷ ἀρχιερεῖ
2 ᾐτήσατο παρ' αὐτοῦ ἐπιστολὰς εἰς Δαμασκὸν πρὸς τὰς συναγωγάς, ὅπως ἐάν τινας εὕρῃ τῆς ὁδοῦ ὄντας ἄνδρας τε καὶ γυναῖκας, δεδεμένους ἀγάγῃ εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ
3 ἐν δὲ τῷ πορεύεσθαι ἐγένετο αὐτὸν ἐγγίζειν τῇ Δαμασκῷ, ἐξαίφνης τε αὐτὸν περιήστραψεν φῶς ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
4 καὶ πεσὼν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἤκουσεν φωνὴν λέγουσαν αὐτῷ, Σαοὺλ Σαούλ, τί με διώκεις;
5 εἶπεν δέ: τίς εἶ, κύριε; ὁ δέ: ἐγώ εἰμι Ἰησοῦς ὃν σὺ διώκεις:
6 ἀλλὰ ἀνάστηθι καὶ εἴσελθε εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ λαληθήσεταί σοι ὅ τί σε δεῖ ποιεῖν.
7 οἱ δὲ ἄνδρες οἱ συνοδεύοντες αὐτῷ εἱστήκεισαν ἐνεοί, ἀκούοντες μὲν τῆς φωνῆς μηδένα δὲ θεωροῦντες.
8 ἠγέρθη δὲ Σαῦλος ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, ἀνεῳγμένων δὲ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ οὐδὲν ἔβλεπεν: χειραγωγοῦντες δὲ αὐτὸν εἰσήγαγον εἰς Δαμασκόν.
9 καὶ ἦν ἡμέρας τρεῖς μὴ βλέπων, καὶ οὐκ ἔφαγεν οὐδὲ ἔπιεν.

10 Ἦν δέ τις μαθητὴς ἐν Δαμασκῷ ὀνόματι Ἁνανίας, καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν ὁράματι ὁ κύριος: Ἁνανία. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν, ἰδοὺ ἐγώ, κύριε.
11 ὁ δὲ κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν, ἀναστὰς πορεύθητι ἐπὶ τὴν ῥύμην τὴν καλουμένην εὐθεῖαν καὶ ζήτησον ἐν οἰκίᾳ Ἰούδα Σαῦλον ὀνόματι Ταρσέα: ἰδοὺ γὰρ προσεύχεται,
12 καὶ εἶδεν ἄνδρα [ἐν ὁράματι] Ἁνανίαν ὀνόματι εἰσελθόντα καὶ ἐπιθέντα αὐτῷ [τὰς] χεῖρας, ὅπως ἀναβλέψῃ.
13 ἀπεκρίθη δὲ Ἁνανίας: κύριε, ἤκουσα ἀπὸ πολλῶν περὶ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς τούτου, ὅσα κακὰ τοῖς ἁγίοις σου ἐποίησεν ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ
14 καὶ ὧδε ἔχει ἐξουσίαν παρὰ τῶν ἀρχιερέων δῆσαι πάντας τοὺς ἐπικαλουμένους τὸ ὄνομά σου.
15 εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος, πορεύου, ὅτι σκεῦος ἐκλογῆς ἐστίν μοι οὗτος τοῦ βαστάσαι τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐνώπιον ἐθνῶν τε καὶ βασιλέων υἱῶν τε Ἰσραήλ:
16 ἐγὼ γὰρ ὑποδείξω αὐτῷ ὅσα δεῖ αὐτὸν ὑπὲρ τοῦ ὀνόματός μου παθεῖν.
17 Ἀπῆλθεν δὲ Ἁνανίας καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ ἐπιθεὶς ἐπ' αὐτὸν τὰς χεῖρας εἶπεν: Σαοὺλ ἀδελφέ, ὁ κύριος ἀπέσταλκέν με, Ἰησοῦς ὁ ὀφθείς σοι ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἤρχου, ὅπως ἀναβλέψῃς καὶ πλησθῇς πνεύματος ἁγίου.
18 καὶ εὐθέως ἀπέπεσαν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ὡς λεπίδες, ἀνέβλεψέν τε, καὶ ἀναστὰς ἐβαπτίσθη,
19 καὶ λαβὼν τροφὴν ἐνίσχυσεν. Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τῶν ἐν Δαμασκῷ μαθητῶν ἡμέρας τινάς,
20 καὶ εὐθέως ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς ἐκήρυσσεν τὸν Ἰησοῦν ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ.
21 ἐξίσταντο δὲ πάντες οἱ ἀκούοντες καὶ ἔλεγον, οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ πορθήσας εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ τοὺς ἐπικαλουμένους τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο, καὶ ὧδε εἰς τοῦτο ἐληλύθει ἵνα δεδεμένους αὐτοὺς ἀγάγῃ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς;
22 Σαῦλος δὲ μᾶλλον ἐνεδυναμοῦτο καὶ συνέχυννεν [τοὺς] Ἰουδαίους τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Δαμασκῷ, συμβιβάζων ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστός.

23 Ὡς δὲ ἐπληροῦντο ἡμέραι ἱκαναί, συνεβουλεύσαντο οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἀνελεῖν αὐτόν:
24 ἐγνώσθη δὲ τῷ Σαύλῳ ἡ ἐπιβουλὴ αὐτῶν. παρετηροῦντο δὲ καὶ τὰς πύλας ἡμέρας τε καὶ νυκτὸς ὅπως αὐτὸν ἀνέλωσιν:
25 λαβόντες δὲ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ νυκτὸς διὰ τοῦ τείχους καθῆκαν αὐτὸν χαλάσαντες ἐν σπυρίδι.
26 Παραγενόμενος δὲ εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἐπείραζεν κολλᾶσθαι τοῖς μαθηταῖς: καὶ πάντες ἐφοβοῦντο αὐτόν, μὴ πιστεύοντες ὅτι ἐστὶν μαθητής.
27 Βαρναβᾶς δὲ ἐπιλαβόμενος αὐτὸν ἤγαγεν πρὸς τοὺς ἀποστόλους, καὶ διηγήσατο αὐτοῖς πῶς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ εἶδεν τὸν κύριον καὶ ὅτι ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ, καὶ πῶς ἐν Δαμασκῷ ἐπαρρησιάσατο ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Ἰησοῦ.
28 καὶ ἦν μετ' αὐτῶν εἰσπορευόμενος καὶ ἐκπορευόμενος εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ παρρησιαζόμενος ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ κυρίου,
29 ἐλάλει τε καὶ συνεζήτει πρὸς τοὺς Ἑλληνιστάς: οἱ δὲ ἐπεχείρουν ἀνελεῖν αὐτόν.
30 ἐπιγνόντες δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ κατήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς Καισάρειαν καὶ ἐξαπέστειλαν αὐτὸν εἰς Ταρσόν.

31 Ἡ μὲν οὖν ἐκκλησία καθ' ὅλης τῆς Ἰουδαίας καὶ Γαλιλαίας καὶ Σαμαρείας εἶχεν εἰρήνην, οἰκοδομουμένη καὶ πορευομένη τῷ φόβῳ τοῦ κυρίου, καὶ τῇ παρακλήσει τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος ἐπληθύνετο.
32 ἐγένετο δὲ Πέτρον διερχόμενον διὰ πάντων κατελθεῖν καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἁγίους τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Λύδδα.
33 εὗρεν δὲ ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπόν τινα ὀνόματι Αἰνέαν ἐξ ἐτῶν ὀκτὼ κατακείμενον ἐπὶ κραβάττου, ὃς ἦν παραλελυμένος.
34 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ Πέτρος, Αἰνέα, ἰᾶταί σε Ἰησοῦς Χριστός: ἀνάστηθι καὶ στρῶσον σεαυτῷ. καὶ εὐθέως ἀνέστη.
35 καὶ εἶδαν αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες Λύδδα καὶ τὸν Σαρῶνα, οἵτινες ἐπέστρεψαν ἐπὶ τὸν κύριον.
36 ἐν Ἰόππῃ δέ τις ἦν μαθήτρια ὀνόματι Ταβιθά, ἣ διερμηνευομένη λέγεται Δορκάς: αὕτη ἦν πλήρης ἔργων ἀγαθῶν καὶ ἐλεημοσυνῶν ὧν ἐποίει.
37 ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἀσθενήσασαν αὐτὴν ἀποθανεῖν: λούσαντες δὲ ἔθηκαν αὐτὴν ἐν ὑπερῴῳ.
38 ἐγγὺς δὲ οὔσης Λύδδας τῇ Ἰόππῃ οἱ μαθηταὶ ἀκούσαντες ὅτι Πέτρος ἐστὶν ἐν αὐτῇ ἀπέστειλαν δύο ἄνδρας πρὸς αὐτὸν παρακαλοῦντες, μὴ ὀκνήσῃς διελθεῖν ἕως ἡμῶν.
39 ἀναστὰς δὲ Πέτρος συνῆλθεν αὐτοῖς: ὃν παραγενόμενον ἀνήγαγον εἰς τὸ ὑπερῷον, καὶ παρέστησαν αὐτῷ πᾶσαι αἱ χῆραι κλαίουσαι καὶ ἐπιδεικνύμεναι χιτῶνας καὶ ἱμάτια ὅσα ἐποίει μετ' αὐτῶν οὖσα ἡ Δορκάς.
40 ἐκβαλὼν δὲ ἔξω πάντας ὁ Πέτρος καὶ θεὶς τὰ γόνατα προσηύξατο, καὶ ἐπιστρέψας πρὸς τὸ σῶμα εἶπεν, Ταβιθά, ἀνάστηθι. ἡ δὲ ἤνοιξεν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἰδοῦσα τὸν Πέτρον ἀνεκάθισεν.
41 δοὺς δὲ αὐτῇ χεῖρα ἀνέστησεν αὐτήν, φωνήσας δὲ τοὺς ἁγίους καὶ τὰς χήρας παρέστησεν αὐτὴν ζῶσαν.
42 γνωστὸν δὲ ἐγένετο καθ' ὅλης τῆς Ἰόππης, καὶ ἐπίστευσαν πολλοὶ ἐπὶ τὸν κύριον.
43 ἐγένετο δὲ ἡμέρας ἱκανὰς μεῖναι ἐν Ἰόππῃ παρά τινι Σίμωνι βυρσεῖ.
