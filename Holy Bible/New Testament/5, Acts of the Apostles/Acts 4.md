# Acts of the Apostles 4 (RSVCE)

### Peter and John before the Council
1 And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadʹducees came upon them,
2 annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
3 And they arrested them and put them in custody until the morrow, for it was already evening.
4 But many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to about five thousand.
5 On the morrow their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem,
6 with Annas the high priest and Caʹiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family.
7 And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, “By what power or by what name did you do this?”
8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders,
9 if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a cripple, by what means this man has been healed,
10 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him this man is standing before you well.
11 This is the stone which was rejected by you builders, but which has become the head of the corner.
12 And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”
13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they wondered; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.
14 But seeing the man that had been healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.
15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred with one another,
16 saying, “What shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
17 But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to any one in this name.”
18 So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
19 But Peter and John answered them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge;
20 for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.”
21 And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for all men praised God for what had happened.
22 For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
### The Believers Pray for Boldness
23 When they were released they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
24 And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,
25 who by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, didst say by the Holy Spirit, ‘Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?
26 The kings of the earth set themselves in array, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed’—g
27 for truly in this city there were gathered together against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
28 to do whatever thy hand and thy plan had predestined to take place.
29 And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,
30 while thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of thy holy servant Jesus.”
31 And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.
### The Believers Share Their Possessions
32 Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common.
33 And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
34 There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of what was sold
35 and laid it at the apostles’ feet; and distribution was made to each as any had need.
36 Thus Joseph who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas (which means, Son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,
37 sold a field which belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.


# Actus Apostolorum 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Loquentibus autem illis ad populum, supervenerunt sacerdotes, et magistratus templi, et sadducæi,
2 dolentes quod docerent populum, et annuntiarent in Jesu resurrectionem ex mortuis:
3 et injecerunt in eos manus, et posuerunt eos in custodiam in crastinum: erat enim jam vespera.
4 Multi autem eorum qui audierant verbum, crediderunt: et factus est numerus virorum quinque millia.
5 Factum est autem in crastinum, ut congregarentur principes eorum, et seniores, et scribæ, in Jerusalem:
6 et Annas princeps sacerdotum, et Caiphas, et Joannes, et Alexander, et quotquot erant de genere sacerdotali.
7 Et statuentes eos in medio, interrogabant: In qua virtute, aut in quo nomine fecistis hoc vos?
8 Tunc repletus Spiritu Sancto Petrus, dixit ad eos: Principes populi, et seniores, audite:
9 si nos hodie dijudicamur in benefacto hominis infirmi, in quo iste salvus factus est,
10 notum sit omnibus vobis, et omni plebi Israël, quia in nomine Domini nostri Jesu Christi Nazareni, quem vos crucifixistis, quem Deus suscitavit a mortuis, in hoc iste astat coram vobis sanus.
11 Hic est lapis qui reprobatus est a vobis ædificantibus, qui factus est in caput anguli:
12 et non est in alio aliquo salus. Nec enim aliud nomen est sub cælo datum hominibus, in quo oporteat nos salvos fieri.

13 Videntes autem Petri constantiam, et Joannis, comperto quod homines essent sine litteris, et idiotæ, admirabantur, et cognoscebant eos quoniam cum Jesu fuerant:
14 hominem quoque videntes stantem cum eis, qui curatus fuerat, nihil poterant contradicere.
15 Jusserunt autem eos foras extra concilium secedere: et conferebant ad invicem,
16 dicentes: Quid faciemus hominibus istis? quoniam quidem notum signum factum est per eos omnibus habitantibus Jerusalem: manifestum est, et non possumus negare.
17 Sed ne amplius divulgetur in populum, comminemur eis ne ultra loquantur in nomine hoc ulli hominum.
18 Et vocantes eos, denuntiaverunt ne omnino loquerentur neque docerent in nomine Jesu.
19 Petrus vero et Joannes respondentes, dixerunt ad eos: Si justum est in conspectu Dei vos potius audire quam Deum, judicate.
20 Non enim possumus quæ vidimus et audivimus non loqui.
21 At illi comminantes dimiserunt eos, non invenientes quomodo punirent eos propter populum: quia omnes clarificabant id quod factum fuerat in eo quod acciderat.
22 Annorum enim erat amplius quadraginta homo, in quo factum fuerat signum istud sanitatis.

23 Dimissi autem venerunt ad suos, et annuntiaverunt eis quanta ad eos principes sacerdotum et seniores dixissent.
24 Qui cum audissent, unanimiter levaverunt vocem ad Deum, et dixerunt: Domine, tu es qui fecisti cælum et terram, mare et omnia quæ in eis sunt:
25 qui Spiritu Sancto per os patris nostri David pueri tui dixisti:Quare fremuerunt gentes,et populi meditati sunt inania?
26 Astiterunt reges terræ,et principes convenerunt in unumadversus Dominum, et adversus Christum ejus.
27 Convenerunt enim vere in civitate ista adversus sanctum puerum tuum Jesum, quem unxisti, Herodes et Pontius Pilatus, cum gentibus et populis Israël,
28 facere quæ manus tua et consilium tuum decreverunt fieri.
29 Et nunc, Domine, respice in minas eorum, et da servis tuis cum omni fiducia loqui verbum tuum,
30 in eo quod manum tuam extendas ad sanitates, et signa, et prodigia fieri per nomen sancti filii tui Jesu.
31 Et cum orassent, motus est locus in quo erant congregati: et repleti sunt omnes Spiritu Sancto, et loquebantur verbum Dei cum fiducia.

32 Multitudinis autem credentium erat cor unum et anima una: nec quisquam eorum quæ possidebat, aliquid suum esse dicebat, sed erant illis omnia communia.
33 Et virtute magna reddebant Apostoli testimonium resurrectionis Jesu Christi Domini nostri: et gratia magna erat in omnibus illis.
34 Neque enim quisquam egens erat inter illos. Quotquot enim possessores agrorum aut domorum erant, vendentes afferebant pretia eorum quæ vendebant,
35 et ponebant ante pedes Apostolorum. Dividebatur autem singulis prout cuique opus erat.
36 Joseph autem, qui cognominatus est Barnabas ab Apostolis (quod est interpretatum, Filius consolationis), Levites, Cyprius genere,
37 cum haberet agrum, vendidit eum, et attulit pretium, et posuit ante pedes Apostolorum.


# Πράξεις τῶν Ἀποστόλων 4 (Textus Receptus)

1 Λαλούντων δὲ αὐτῶν πρὸς τὸν λαὸν ἐπέστησαν αὐτοῖς οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ ὁ στρατηγὸς τοῦ ἱεροῦ καὶ οἱ Σαδδουκαῖοι,
2 διαπονούμενοι διὰ τὸ διδάσκειν αὐτοὺς τὸν λαὸν καὶ καταγγέλλειν ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ τὴν ἀνάστασιν τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν,
3 καὶ ἐπέβαλον αὐτοῖς τὰς χεῖρας καὶ ἔθεντο εἰς τήρησιν εἰς τὴν αὔριον: ἦν γὰρ ἑσπέρα ἤδη.
4 πολλοὶ δὲ τῶν ἀκουσάντων τὸν λόγον ἐπίστευσαν, καὶ ἐγενήθη [ὁ] ἀριθμὸς τῶν ἀνδρῶν [ὡς] χιλιάδες πέντε.
5 Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν αὔριον συναχθῆναι αὐτῶν τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ
6 καὶ Ἅννας ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς καὶ Καϊάφας καὶ Ἰωάννης καὶ Ἀλέξανδρος καὶ ὅσοι ἦσαν ἐκ γένους ἀρχιερατικοῦ
7 καὶ στήσαντες αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ μέσῳ ἐπυνθάνοντο, ἐν ποίᾳ δυνάμει ἢ ἐν ποίῳ ὀνόματι ἐποιήσατε τοῦτο ὑμεῖς;
8 τότε Πέτρος πλησθεὶς πνεύματος ἁγίου εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς, ἄρχοντες τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ πρεσβύτεροι,
9 εἰ ἡμεῖς σήμερον ἀνακρινόμεθα ἐπὶ εὐεργεσίᾳ ἀνθρώπου ἀσθενοῦς, ἐν τίνι οὗτος σέσωται,
10 γνωστὸν ἔστω πᾶσιν ὑμῖν καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραὴλ ὅτι ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τοῦ Ναζωραίου, ὃν ὑμεῖς ἐσταυρώσατε, ὃν ὁ θεὸς ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν, ἐν τούτῳ οὗτος παρέστηκεν ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ὑγιής.
11 οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ λίθος ὁ ἐξουθενηθεὶς ὑφ' ὑμῶν τῶν οἰκοδόμων, ὁ γενόμενος εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας.
12 καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ἄλλῳ οὐδενὶ ἡ σωτηρία, οὐδὲ γὰρ ὄνομά ἐστιν ἕτερον ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν τὸ δεδομένον ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἐν ᾧ δεῖ σωθῆναι ἡμᾶς.

13 Θεωροῦντες δὲ τὴν τοῦ Πέτρου παρρησίαν καὶ Ἰωάννου, καὶ καταλαβόμενοι ὅτι ἄνθρωποι ἀγράμματοί εἰσιν καὶ ἰδιῶται, ἐθαύμαζον ἐπεγίνωσκόν τε αὐτοὺς ὅτι σὺν τῷ Ἰησοῦ ἦσαν:
14 τόν τε ἄνθρωπον βλέποντες σὺν αὐτοῖς ἑστῶτα τὸν τεθεραπευμένον οὐδὲν εἶχον ἀντειπεῖν.
15 κελεύσαντες δὲ αὐτοὺς ἔξω τοῦ συνεδρίου ἀπελθεῖν συνέβαλλον πρὸς ἀλλήλους
16 λέγοντες, τί ποιήσωμεν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τούτοις; ὅτι μὲν γὰρ γνωστὸν σημεῖον γέγονεν δι' αὐτῶν πᾶσιν τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἰερουσαλὴμ φανερόν, καὶ οὐ δυνάμεθα ἀρνεῖσθαι:
17 ἀλλ' ἵνα μὴ ἐπὶ πλεῖον διανεμηθῇ εἰς τὸν λαόν, ἀπειλησώμεθα αὐτοῖς μηκέτι λαλεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ μηδενὶ ἀνθρώπων.
18 καὶ καλέσαντες αὐτοὺς παρήγγειλαν τὸ καθόλου μὴ φθέγγεσθαι μηδὲ διδάσκειν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Ἰησοῦ.
19 ὁ δὲ Πέτρος καὶ Ἰωάννης ἀποκριθέντες εἶπον πρὸς αὐτούς: εἰ δίκαιόν ἐστιν ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν ἀκούειν μᾶλλον ἢ τοῦ θεοῦ, κρίνατε:
20 οὐ δυνάμεθα γὰρ ἡμεῖς ἃ εἴδαμεν καὶ ἠκούσαμεν μὴ λαλεῖν.
21 οἱ δὲ προσαπειλησάμενοι ἀπέλυσαν αὐτούς, μηδὲν εὑρίσκοντες τὸ πῶς κολάσωνται αὐτούς, διὰ τὸν λαόν, ὅτι πάντες ἐδόξαζον τὸν θεὸν ἐπὶ τῷ γεγονότι:
22 ἐτῶν γὰρ ἦν πλειόνων τεσσεράκοντα ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐφ' ὃν γεγόνει τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο τῆς ἰάσεως.

23 Ἀπολυθέντες δὲ ἦλθον πρὸς τοὺς ἰδίους καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν ὅσα πρὸς αὐτοὺς οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι εἶπαν.
24 οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἦραν φωνὴν πρὸς τὸν θεὸν καὶ εἶπαν, δέσποτα, σὺ ὁ ποιήσας τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς,
25 ὁ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν διὰ πνεύματος ἁγίου στόματος Δαυὶδ παιδός σου εἰπών, ἱνατί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά;
26 παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ κατὰ τοῦ κυρίου καὶ κατὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ.
27 συνήχθησαν γὰρ ἐπ' ἀληθείας ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ ἐπὶ τὸν ἅγιον παῖδά σου Ἰησοῦν, ὃν ἔχρισας, Ἡρῴδης τε καὶ Πόντιος Πιλᾶτος σὺν ἔθνεσιν καὶ λαοῖς Ἰσραήλ,
28 ποιῆσαι ὅσα ἡ χείρ σου καὶ ἡ βουλή σου προώρισεν γενέσθαι.
29 καὶ τὰ νῦν, κύριε, ἔπιδε ἐπὶ τὰς ἀπειλὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ δὸς τοῖς δούλοις σου μετὰ παρρησίας πάσης λαλεῖν τὸν λόγον σου,
30 ἐν τῷ τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐκτείνειν σε εἰς ἴασιν καὶ σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα γίνεσθαι διὰ τοῦ ὀνόματος τοῦ ἁγίου παιδός σου Ἰησοῦ.
31 καὶ δεηθέντων αὐτῶν ἐσαλεύθη ὁ τόπος ἐν ᾧ ἦσαν συνηγμένοι, καὶ ἐπλήσθησαν ἅπαντες τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος, καὶ ἐλάλουν τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ μετὰ παρρησίας.

32 Τοῦ δὲ πλήθους τῶν πιστευσάντων ἦν καρδία καὶ ψυχὴ μία, καὶ οὐδὲ εἷς τι τῶν ὑπαρχόντων αὐτῷ ἔλεγεν ἴδιον εἶναι, ἀλλ' ἦν αὐτοῖς ἅπαντα κοινά.
33 καὶ δυνάμει μεγάλῃ ἀπεδίδουν τὸ μαρτύριον οἱ ἀπόστολοι τῆς ἀναστάσεως τοῦ κυρίου, Ἰησοῦ, χάρις τε μεγάλη ἦν ἐπὶ πάντας αὐτούς.
34 οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐνδεής τις ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς: ὅσοι γὰρ κτήτορες χωρίων ἢ οἰκιῶν ὑπῆρχον, πωλοῦντες ἔφερον τὰς τιμὰς τῶν πιπρασκομένων
35 καὶ ἐτίθουν παρὰ τοὺς πόδας τῶν ἀποστόλων: διεδίδετο δὲ ἑκάστῳ καθότι ἄν τις χρείαν εἶχεν.
36 Ἰωσὴφ δὲ ὁ ἐπικληθεὶς Βαρναβᾶς ἀπὸ τῶν ἀποστόλων, ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον υἱὸς παρακλήσεως, Λευίτης, Κύπριος τῷ γένει,
37 ὑπάρχοντος αὐτῷ ἀγροῦ πωλήσας ἤνεγκεν τὸ χρῆμα καὶ ἔθηκεν πρὸς τοὺς πόδας τῶν ἀποστόλων.
