# Letter of Paul to the Galatians 4 (RSVCE)

1 I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no better than a slave, though he is the owner of all the estate;
2 but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father.
3 So with us; when we were children, we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe.
4 But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law,
5 to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.
6 And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!”
7 So through God you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son then an heir.
### Paul Reproves the Galatians
8 Formerly, when you did not know God, you were in bondage to beings that by nature are no gods;
9 but now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits, whose slaves you want to be once more?
10 You observe days, and months, and seasons, and years!
11 I am afraid I have labored over you in vain.
12 Brethren, I beseech you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong;
13 you know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first;
14 and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
15 What has become of the satisfaction you felt? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
16 Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth?
17 They make much of you, but for no good purpose; they want to shut you out, that you may make much of them.
18 For a good purpose it is always good to be made much of, and not only when I am present with you.
19 My little children, with whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you!
20 I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
### The Allegory of Hagar and Sarah
21 Tell me, you who desire to be under law, do you not hear the law?
22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave and one by a free woman.
23 But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, the son of the free woman through promise.
24 Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.
25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
27 For it is written, “Rejoice, O barren one that dost not bear; break forth and shout, thou who art not in travail; for the desolate hath more children than she who hath a husband.”
28 Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.
29 But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.
30 But what does the scripture say? “Cast out the slave and her son; for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.”
31 So, brethren, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.


# Epistola ad Galatas 4 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Dico autem: quanto tempore hæres parvulus est, nihil differt a servo, cum sit dominus omnium:
2 sed sub tutoribus et actoribus est usque ad præfinitum tempus a patre:
3 ita et nos cum essemus parvuli, sub elementis mundi eramus servientes.
4 At ubi venit plenitudo temporis, misit Deus Filium suum factum ex muliere, factum sub lege,
5 ut eos, qui sub lege erant, redimeret, ut adoptionem filiorum reciperemus.
6 Quoniam autem estis filii, misit Deus Spiritum Filii sui in corda vestra, clamantem: Abba, Pater.
7 Itaque jam non est servus, sed filius: quod si filius, et hæres per Deum.
8 Sed tunc quidem ignorantes Deum, iis, qui natura non sunt dii, serviebatis.
9 Nunc autem cum cognoveritis Deum, immo cogniti sitis a Deo: quomodo convertimini iterum ad infirma et egena elementa, quibus denuo servire vultis?
10 Dies observatis, et menses, et tempora, et annos.
11 Timeo vos, ne forte sine causa laboraverim in vobis.

12 Estote sicut ego, quia et ego sicut vos: fratres, obsecro vos. Nihil me læsistis.
13 Scitis autem quia per infirmitatem carnis evangelizavi vobis jampridem: et tentationem vestram in carne mea
14 non sprevistis, neque respuistis: sed sicut angelum Dei excepistis me, sicut Christum Jesum.
15 Ubi est ergo beatitudo vestra? testimonium enim perhibeo vobis, quia, si fieri posset, oculos vestros eruissetis, et dedissetis mihi.
16 Ergo inimicus vobis factus sum, verum dicens vobis?
17 Æmulantur vos non bene: sed excludere vos volunt, ut illos æmulemini.
18 Bonum autem æmulamini in bono semper: et non tantum cum præsens sum apud vos.
19 Filioli mei, quos iterum parturio, donec formetur Christus in vobis:
20 vellem autem esse apud vos modo, et mutare vocem meam: quoniam confundor in vobis.

21 Dicite mihi qui sub lege vultis esse: legem non legistis?
22 Scriptum est enim: Quoniam Abraham duos filios habuit: unum de ancilla, et unum de libera.
23 Sed qui de ancilla, secundum carnem natus est: qui autem de libera, per repromissionem:
24 quæ sunt per allegoriam dicta. Hæc enim sunt duo testamenta. Unum quidem in monte Sina, in servitutem generans, quæ est Agar:
25 Sina enim mons est in Arabia, qui conjunctus est ei quæ nunc est Jerusalem, et servit cum filiis suis.
26 Illa autem, quæ sursum est Jerusalem, libera est, quæ est mater nostra.
27 Scriptum est enim:Lætare sterilis, quæ non paris;erumpe et clama, quæ non parturis:quia multi filii desertæ,magis quam ejus quæ habet virum.
28 Nos autem, fratres, secundum Isaac promissionis filii sumus.
29 Sed quomodo tunc is, qui secundum carnem natus fuerat, persequebatur eum qui secundum spiritum: ita et nunc.
30 Sed quid dicit Scriptura? Ejice ancillam, et filium ejus: non enim hæres erit filius ancillæ cum filio liberæ.

31 Itaque, fratres, non sumus ancillæ filii, sed liberæ: qua libertate Christus nos liberavit.


# Πρὸς Γαλάτας 4 (Textus Receptus)

1 Λέγω δέ, ἐφ' ὅσον χρόνον ὁ κληρονόμος νήπιός ἐστιν, οὐδὲν διαφέρει δούλου κύριος πάντων ὤν,
2 ἀλλὰ ὑπὸ ἐπιτρόπους ἐστὶν καὶ οἰκονόμους ἄχρι τῆς προθεσμίας τοῦ πατρός.
3 οὕτως καὶ ἡμεῖς, ὅτε ἦμεν νήπιοι, ὑπὸ τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου ἤμεθα δεδουλωμένοι:
4 ὅτε δὲ ἦλθεν τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ χρόνου, ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, γενόμενον ἐκ γυναικός, γενόμενον ὑπὸ νόμον,
5 ἵνα τοὺς ὑπὸ νόμον ἐξαγοράσῃ, ἵνα τὴν υἱοθεσίαν ἀπολάβωμεν.
6 ὅτι δέ ἐστε υἱοί, ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ θεὸς τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰς καρδίας ἡμῶν, κρᾶζον: Αββα ὁ πατήρ.
7 ὥστε οὐκέτι εἶ δοῦλος ἀλλὰ υἱός: εἰ δὲ υἱός, καὶ κληρονόμος διὰ θεοῦ.
8 Ἀλλὰ τότε μὲν οὐκ εἰδότες θεὸν ἐδουλεύσατε τοῖς φύσει μὴ οὖσιν θεοῖς:
9 νῦν δὲ γνόντες θεόν, μᾶλλον δὲ γνωσθέντες ὑπὸ θεοῦ, πῶς ἐπιστρέφετε πάλιν ἐπὶ τὰ ἀσθενῆ καὶ πτωχὰ στοιχεῖα, οἷς πάλιν ἄνωθεν δουλεύειν θέλετε;
10 ἡμέρας παρατηρεῖσθε καὶ μῆνας καὶ καιροὺς καὶ ἐνιαυτούς.
11 φοβοῦμαι ὑμᾶς μή 
 1 Consider this; one who comes into his property while he is still a child has no more liberty than one of the servants, though all the estate is his;  2 he is under the control of guardians and trustees, until he reaches the age prescribed by his father.  3 So it was with us; in those childish days of ours we toiled away at the schoolroom tasks which the world gave us,[1]  4 till the appointed time came. Then God sent out his Son on a mission to us. He took birth from a woman, took birth as a subject of the law,  5 so as to ransom those who were subject to the law, and make us sons by adoption.  6 To prove that you are sons,[2] God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying out in us, Abba, Father.  7 No longer, then, art thou a slave, thou art a son; and because thou art a son, thou hast, by divine appointment, the son’s right of inheritance.  8 Formerly you had no knowledge of God; you lived as the slaves of deities who were in truth no deities at all.  9 Now you have recognized the true God, or rather, the true God has recognized you. How is it that you are going back to those old schoolroom tasks of yours, so abject, so ineffectual, eager to begin your drudgery all over again?  10 You have begun to observe special days and months, special seasons and years.[3]  11 I am anxious over you; has all the labour I have spent on you been useless? 
 1 Dico autem: quanto tempore hæres parvulus est, nihil differt a servo, cum sit dominus omnium: 2 sed sub tutoribus et actoribus est usque ad præfinitum tempus a patre: 3 ita et nos cum essemus parvuli, sub elementis mundi eramus servientes. 4 At ubi venit plenitudo temporis, misit Deus Filium suum factum ex muliere, factum sub lege, 5 ut eos, qui sub lege erant, redimeret, ut adoptionem filiorum reciperemus. 6 Quoniam autem estis filii, misit Deus Spiritum Filii sui in corda vestra, clamantem: Abba, Pater. 7 Itaque jam non est servus, sed filius: quod si filius, et hæres per Deum. 8 Sed tunc quidem ignorantes Deum, iis, qui natura non sunt dii, serviebatis. 9 Nunc autem cum cognoveritis Deum, immo cogniti sitis a Deo: quomodo convertimini iterum ad infirma et egena elementa, quibus denuo servire vultis? 10 Dies observatis, et menses, et tempora, et annos. 11 Timeo vos, ne forte sine causa laboraverim in vobis.

12 Γίνεσθε ὡς ἐγώ, ὅτι κἀγὼ ὡς ὑμεῖς, ἀδελφοί, δέομαι ὑμῶν. οὐδέν με ἠδικήσατε:
13 οἴδατε δὲ ὅτι δι' ἀσθένειαν τῆς σαρκὸς εὐηγγελισάμην ὑμῖν τὸ πρότερον,
14 καὶ τὸν πειρασμὸν ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου οὐκ ἐξουθενήσατε οὐδὲ ἐξεπτύσατε, ἀλλὰ ὡς ἄγγελον θεοῦ ἐδέξασθέ με, ὡς Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν.
15 ποῦ οὖν ὁ μακαρισμὸς ὑμῶν; μαρτυρῶ γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι εἰ δυνατὸν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν ἐξορύξαντες ἐδώκατέ μοι.
16 ὥστε ἐχθρὸς ὑμῶν γέγονα ἀληθεύων ὑμῖν;
17 ζηλοῦσιν ὑμᾶς οὐ καλῶς, ἀλλὰ ἐκκλεῖσαι ὑμᾶς θέλουσιν, ἵνα αὐτοὺς ζηλοῦτε.
18 καλὸν δὲ ζηλοῦσθαι ἐν καλῷ πάντοτε, καὶ μὴ μόνον ἐν τῷ παρεῖναί με πρὸς ὑμᾶς,
19 τέκνα μου, οὓς πάλιν ὠδίνω μέχρις οὗ μορφωθῇ Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν,
20 ἤθελον δὲ παρεῖναι πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἄρτι, καὶ ἀλλάξαι τὴν φωνήν μου, ὅτι ἀποροῦμαι ἐν ὑμῖν.

21 Λέγετέ μοι, οἱ ὑπὸ νόμον θέλοντες εἶναι, τὸν νόμον οὐκ ἀκούετε;
22 γέγραπται γὰρ ὅτι Ἀβραὰμ δύο υἱοὺς ἔσχεν, ἕνα ἐκ τῆς παιδίσκης καὶ ἕνα ἐκ τῆς ἐλευθέρας.
23 ἀλλ' ὁ μὲν ἐκ τῆς παιδίσκης κατὰ σάρκα γεγέννηται, ὁ δὲ ἐκ τῆς ἐλευθέρας δι' ἐπαγγελίας.
24 ἅτινά ἐστιν ἀλληγορούμενα: αὗται γάρ εἰσιν δύο διαθῆκαι, μία μὲν ἀπὸ ὄρους Σινᾶ, εἰς δουλείαν γεννῶσα, ἥτις ἐστὶν Ἁγάρ.
25 τὸ δὲ Ἁγὰρ Σινᾶ ὄρος ἐστὶν ἐν τῇ Ἀραβίᾳ: συστοιχεῖ δὲ τῇ νῦν Ἰερουσαλήμ δουλεύει γὰρ μετὰ τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς.
26 ἡ δὲ ἄνω Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἐλευθέρα ἐστίν, ἥτις ἐστὶν μήτηρ ἡμῶν:
27 γέγραπται γάρ, εὐφράνθητι, στεῖρα ἡ οὐ τίκτουσα: ῥῆξον καὶ βόησον, ἡ οὐκ ὠδίνουσα: ὅτι πολλὰ τὰ τέκνα τῆς ἐρήμου μᾶλλον ἢ τῆς ἐχούσης τὸν ἄνδρα.
28 ὑμεῖς δέ, ἀδελφοί, κατὰ Ἰσαὰκ ἐπαγγελίας τέκνα ἐστέ.
29 ἀλλ' ὥσπερ τότε ὁ κατὰ σάρκα γεννηθεὶς ἐδίωκεν τὸν κατὰ πνεῦμα, οὕτως καὶ νῦν.
30 ἀλλὰ τί λέγει ἡ γραφή; ἔκβαλε τὴν παιδίσκην καὶ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς, οὐ γὰρ μὴ κληρονομήσει ὁ υἱὸς τῆς παιδίσκης μετὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ τῆς ἐλευθέρας.

31 διό, ἀδελφοί, οὐκ ἐσμὲν παιδίσκης τέκνα ἀλλὰ τῆς ἐλευθέρας.
