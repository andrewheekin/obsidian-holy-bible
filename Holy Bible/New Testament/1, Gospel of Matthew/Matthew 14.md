# Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14 (RSVCE)

### The Death of John the Baptist
1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus;
2 and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist, he has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.”
3 For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison, for the sake of Heroʹdi-as, his brother Philip’s wife;
4 because John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”
5 And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.
6 But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Heroʹdi-as danced before the company, and pleased Herod,
7 so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
8 Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.”
9 And the king was sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given;
10 he sent and had John beheaded in the prison,
11 and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
12 And his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.
### Feeding the Five Thousand
13 Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place apart. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
14 As he went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
15 When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a lonely place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”
16 Jesus said, “They need not go away; you give them something to eat.”
17 They said to him, “We have only five loaves here and two fish.”
18 And he said, “Bring them here to me.”
19 Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass; and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
20 And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
21 And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
### Jesus Walks on the Water
22 Then he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
23 And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up into the hills by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,
24 but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them.
25 And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.
26 But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out for fear.
27 But immediately he spoke to them, saying, “Take heart, it is I; have no fear.”
28 And Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water.”
29 He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus;
30 but when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, “Lord, save me.”
31 Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “O man of little faith, why did you doubt?”
32 And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
33 And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”
### Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret
34 And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesʹaret.
35 And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent round to all that region and brought to him all that were sick,
36 and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.


# Evangelium Secundum Matthaeum 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In illo tempore audivit Herodes tetrarcha famam Jesu:
2 et ait pueris suis: Hic est Joannes Baptista: ipse surrexit a mortuis, et ideo virtutes operantur in eo.
3 Herodes enim tenuit Joannem, et alligavit eum: et posuit in carcerem propter Herodiadem uxorem fratris sui.
4 Dicebat enim illi Joannes: Non licet tibi habere eam.
5 Et volens illum occidere, timuit populum: quia sicut prophetam eum habebant.
6 Die autem natalis Herodis saltavit filia Herodiadis in medio, et placuit Herodi:
7 unde cum juramento pollicitus est ei dare quodcumque postulasset ab eo.
8 At illa præmonita a matre sua: Da mihi, inquit, hic in disco caput Joannis Baptistæ.
9 Et contristatus est rex: propter juramentum autem, et eos qui pariter recumbebant, jussit dari.
10 Misitque et decollavit Joannem in carcere.
11 Et allatum est caput ejus in disco, et datum est puellæ, et attulit matri suæ.
12 Et accedentes discipuli ejus, tulerunt corpus ejus, et sepelierunt illud: et venientes nuntiaverunt Jesu.

13 Quod cum audisset Jesus, secessit inde in navicula, in locum desertum seorsum: et cum audissent turbæ, secutæ sunt eum pedestres de civitatibus.
14 Et exiens vidit turbam multam, et misertus est eis, et curavit languidos eorum.
15 Vespere autem facto, accesserunt ad eum discipuli ejus, dicentes: Desertus est locus, et hora jam præteriit: dimitte turbas, ut euntes in castella, emant sibi escas.
16 Jesus autem dixit eis: Non habent necesse ire: date illis vos manducare.
17 Responderunt ei: Non habemus hic nisi quinque panes et duos pisces.
18 Qui ait eis: Afferte mihi illos huc.
19 Et cum jussisset turbam discumbere super fœnum, acceptis quinque panibus et duobus piscibus, aspiciens in cælum benedixit, et fregit, et dedit discipulis panes, discipuli autem turbis.
20 Et manducaverunt omnes, et saturati sunt. Et tulerunt reliquias, duodecim cophinos fragmentorum plenos.
21 Manducantium autem fuit numerus quinque millia virorum, exceptis mulieribus et parvulis.

22 Et statim compulit Jesus discipulos ascendere in naviculam, et præcedere eum trans fretum, donec dimitteret turbas.
23 Et dimissa turba, ascendit in montem solus orare. Vespere autem facto solus erat ibi:
24 navicula autem in medio mari jactabatur fluctibus: erat enim contrarius ventus.
25 Quarta enim vigilia noctis, venit ad eos ambulans super mare.
26 Et videntes eum super mare ambulantem, turbati sunt, dicentes: Quia phantasma est. Et præ timore clamaverunt.
27 Statimque Jesus locutus est eis, dicens: Habete fiduciam: ego sum, nolite timere.
28 Respondens autem Petrus, dixit: Domine, si tu es, jube me ad te venire super aquas.
29 At ipse ait: Veni. Et descendens Petrus de navicula, ambulabat super aquam ut veniret ad Jesum.
30 Videns vero ventum validum, timuit: et cum cœpisset mergi, clamavit dicens: Domine, salvum me fac.
31 Et continuo Jesus extendens manum, apprehendit eum: et ait illi: Modicæ fidei, quare dubitasti?
32 Et cum ascendissent in naviculam, cessavit ventus.
33 Qui autem in navicula erant, venerunt, et adoraverunt eum, dicentes: Vere Filius Dei es.

34 Et cum transfretassent, venerunt in terram Genesar.
35 Et cum cognovissent eum viri loci illius, miserunt in universam regionem illam, et obtulerunt ei omnes male habentes:
36 et rogabant eum ut vel fimbriam vestimenti ejus tangerent. Et quicumque tetigerunt, salvi facti sunt.


# Κατὰ Ματθαῖον 14 (Textus Receptus)

1 Ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ ἤκουσεν Ἡρῴδης ὁ τετραάρχης τὴν ἀκοὴν Ἰησοῦ,
2 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ: οὗτός ἐστιν Ἰωάννης ὁ βαπτιστής: αὐτὸς ἠγέρθη ἀπὸ τῶν νεκρῶν, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο αἱ δυνάμεις ἐνεργοῦσιν ἐν αὐτῷ.
3 ὁ γὰρ Ἡρῴδης κρατήσας τὸν Ἰωάννην ἔδησεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐν φυλακῇ ἀπέθετο διὰ Ἡρῳδιάδα τὴν γυναῖκα Φιλίππου] τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ.
4 ἔλεγεν γὰρ ὁ Ἰωάννης αὐτῷ: οὐκ ἔξεστίν σοι ἔχειν αὐτήν.
5 καὶ θέλων αὐτὸν ἀποκτεῖναι ἐφοβήθη τὸν ὄχλον, ὅτι ὡς προφήτην αὐτὸν εἶχον.
6 γενεσίοις δὲ γενομένοις τοῦ Ἡρῴδου ὠρχήσατο ἡ θυγάτηρ τῆς Ἡρῳδιάδος ἐν τῷ μέσῳ καὶ ἤρεσεν τῷ Ἡρῴδῃ,
7 ὅθεν μεθ' ὅρκου ὡμολόγησεν αὐτῇ δοῦναι ὃ ἐὰν αἰτήσηται.
8 ἡ δὲ προβιβασθεῖσα ὑπὸ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτῆς: δός μοι, φησίν, ὧδε ἐπὶ πίνακι τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἰωάννου τοῦ βαπτιστοῦ.
9 καὶ λυπηθεὶς ὁ βασιλεὺς διὰ τοὺς ὅρκους καὶ τοὺς συνανακειμένους ἐκέλευσεν δοθῆναι,
10 καὶ πέμψας ἀπεκεφάλισεν τὸν Ἰωάννην ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ:
11 καὶ ἠνέχθη ἡ κεφαλὴ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πίνακι καὶ ἐδόθη τῷ κορασίῳ, καὶ ἤνεγκεν τῇ μητρὶ αὐτῆς.
12 καὶ προσελθόντες οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ ἦραν τὸ πτῶμα καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐλθόντες ἀπήγγειλαν τῷ Ἰησοῦ.

13 ἀκούσας δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἀνεχώρησεν ἐκεῖθεν ἐν πλοίῳ εἰς ἔρημον τόπον κατ' ἰδίαν: καὶ ἀκούσαντες οἱ ὄχλοι ἠκολούθησαν αὐτῷ πεζῇ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων.
14 Καὶ ἐξελθὼν εἶδεν πολὺν ὄχλον, καὶ ἐσπλαγχνίσθη ἐπ' αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐθεράπευσεν τοὺς ἀρρώστους αὐτῶν.
15 ὀψίας δὲ γενομένης προσῆλθον αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ λέγοντες: ἔρημός ἐστιν ὁ τόπος καὶ ἡ ὥρα ἤδη παρῆλθεν ἀπόλυσον τοὺς ὄχλους, ἵνα ἀπελθόντες εἰς τὰς κώμας ἀγοράσωσιν ἑαυτοῖς βρώματα.
16 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν ἀπελθεῖν: δότε αὐτοῖς ὑμεῖς φαγεῖν.
17 οἱ δὲ λέγουσιν αὐτῷ: οὐκ ἔχομεν ὧδε εἰ μὴ πέντε ἄρτους καὶ δύο ἰχθύας.
18 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν: φέρετέ μοι ὧδε αὐτούς.
19 καὶ κελεύσας τοὺς ὄχλους ἀνακλιθῆναι ἐπὶ τοῦ χόρτου, λαβὼν τοὺς πέντε ἄρτους καὶ τοὺς δύο ἰχθύας, ἀναβλέψας εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν εὐλόγησεν, καὶ κλάσας ἔδωκεν τοῖς μαθηταῖς τοὺς ἄρτους οἱ δὲ μαθηταὶ τοῖς ὄχλοις.
20 καὶ ἔφαγον πάντες καὶ ἐχορτάσθησαν, καὶ ἦραν τὸ περισσεῦον τῶν κλασμάτων δώδεκα κοφίνους πλήρεις.
21 οἱ δὲ ἐσθίοντες ἦσαν ἄνδρες ὡσεὶ πεντακισχίλιοι χωρὶς γυναικῶν καὶ παιδίων.

22 Καὶ εὐθέως ἠνάγκασεν τοὺς μαθητὰς ἐμβῆναι εἰς τὸ πλοῖον καὶ προάγειν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ πέραν, ἕως οὗ ἀπολύσῃ τοὺς ὄχλους.
23 καὶ ἀπολύσας τοὺς ὄχλους ἀνέβη εἰς τὸ ὄρος κατ' ἰδίαν προσεύξασθαι. ὀψίας δὲ γενομένης μόνος ἦν ἐκεῖ.
24 τὸ δὲ πλοῖον ἤδη σταδίους πολλοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἀπεῖχεν βασανιζόμενον ὑπὸ τῶν κυμάτων: ἦν γὰρ ἐναντίος ὁ ἄνεμος.
25 τετάρτῃ δὲ φυλακῇ τῆς νυκτὸς ἦλθεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς περιπατῶν ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν.
26 οἱ δὲ μαθηταὶ ἰδόντες αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάσσης περιπατοῦντα ἐταράχθησαν λέγοντες ὅτι φάντασμά ἐστιν, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου ἔκραξαν.
27 εὐθὺς δὲ ἐλάλησεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς αὐτοῖς λέγων: θαρσεῖτε, ἐγώ εἰμι: μὴ φοβεῖσθε.
28 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Πέτρος εἶπεν: κύριε, εἰ σὺ εἶ, κέλευσόν με ἐλθεῖν πρὸς σὲ ἐπὶ τὰ ὕδατα:
29 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν: ἐλθέ. καὶ καταβὰς ἀπὸ τοῦ πλοίου ὁ Πέτρος περιεπάτησεν ἐπὶ τὰ ὕδατα καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς τὸν Ἰησοῦν.
30 βλέπων δὲ τὸν ἄνεμον ἰσχυρὸν ἐφοβήθη, καὶ ἀρξάμενος καταποντίζεσθαι ἔκραξεν λέγων: κύριε, σῶσόν με.
31 εὐθέως δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐκτείνας τὴν χεῖρα ἐπελάβετο αὐτοῦ καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ: ὀλιγόπιστε, εἰς τί ἐδίστασας;
32 καὶ ἀναβάντων αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ πλοῖον ἐκόπασεν ὁ ἄνεμος.
33 οἱ δὲ ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες: ἀληθῶς θεοῦ υἱὸς εἶ.

34 Καὶ διαπεράσαντες ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν εἰς Γεννησαρέτ.
35 καὶ ἐπιγνόντες αὐτὸν οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου ἀπέστειλαν εἰς ὅλην τὴν περίχωρον ἐκείνην, καὶ προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ πάντας τοὺς κακῶς ἔχοντας,
36 καὶ παρεκάλουν αὐτὸν ἵνα μόνον ἅψωνται τοῦ κρασπέδου τοῦ ἱματίου αὐτοῦ: καὶ ὅσοι ἥψαντο διεσώθησαν.
