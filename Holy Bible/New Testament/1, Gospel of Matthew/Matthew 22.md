# Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22 (RSVCE)

### The Parable of the Wedding Banquet
1 And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying,
2 “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a marriage feast for his son,
3 and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast; but they would not come.
4 Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have made ready my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves are killed, and everything is ready; come to the marriage feast.’
5 But they made light of it and went off, one to his farm, another to his business,
6 while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.
7 The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
8 Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy.
9 Go therefore to the thoroughfares, and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.’
10 And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.
11 “But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment;
12 and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless.
13 Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.’
14 For many are called, but few are chosen.”
### The Question about Paying Taxes
15 Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle him in his talk.
16 And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Heroʹdi-ans, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God truthfully, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men.
17 Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”
18 But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites?
19 Show me the money for the tax.” And they brought him a coin.
20 And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?”
21 They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”
22 When they heard it, they marveled; and they left him and went away.
### The Question about the Resurrection
23 The same day Sadʹducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him a question,
24 saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies, having no children, his brother must marry the widow, and raise up children for his brother.’
25 Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married, and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother.
26 So too the second and third, down to the seventh.
27 After them all, the woman died.
28 In the resurrection, therefore, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her.”
29 But Jesus answered them, “You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.
30 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
31 And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God,
32 ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.”
33 And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
### The Greatest Commandment
34 But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadʹducees, they came together.
35 And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, to test him.
36 “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?”
37 And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.
38 This is the great and first commandment.
39 And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
40 On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.”
### The Question about David’s Son
41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
42 saying, “What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “The son of David.”
43 He said to them, “How is it then that David, inspired by the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,
44 ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I put thy enemies under thy feet’?
45 If David thus calls him Lord, how is he his son?”
46 And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did any one dare to ask him any more questions.


# Evangelium Secundum Matthaeum 22 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et respondens Jesus, dixit iterum in parabolis eis, dicens:
2 Simile factum est regnum cælorum homini regi, qui fecit nuptias filio suo.
3 Et misit servos suos vocare invitatos ad nuptias, et nolebant venire.
4 Iterum misit alios servos, dicens: Dicite invitatis: Ecce prandium meum paravi, tauri mei et altilia occisa sunt, et omnia parata: venite ad nuptias.
5 Illi autem neglexerunt: et abierunt, alius in villam suam, alius vero ad negotiationem suam:
6 reliqui vero tenuerunt servos ejus, et contumeliis affectos occiderunt.
7 Rex autem cum audisset, iratus est: et missis exercitibus suis, perdidit homicidas illos, et civitatem illorum succendit.
8 Tunc ait servis suis: Nuptiæ quidem paratæ sunt, sed qui invitati erant, non fuerunt digni:
9 ite ergo ad exitus viarum, et quoscumque inveneritis, vocate ad nuptias.
10 Et egressi servi ejus in vias, congregaverunt omnes quos invenerunt, malos et bonos: et impletæ sunt nuptiæ discumbentium.
11 Intravit autem rex ut videret discumbentes, et vidit ibi hominem non vestitum veste nuptiali.
12 Et ait illi: Amice, quomodo huc intrasti non habens vestem nuptialem? At ille obmutuit.
13 Tunc dicit rex ministris: Ligatis manibus et pedibus ejus, mittite eum in tenebras exteriores: ibi erit fletus et stridor dentium.
14 Multi enim sunt vocati, pauci vero electi.

15 Tunc abeuntes pharisæi, consilium inierunt ut caperent eum in sermone.
16 Et mittunt ei discipulos suos cum Herodianis, dicentes: Magister, scimus quia verax es, et viam Dei in veritate doces, et non est tibi cura de aliquo: non enim respicis personam hominum:
17 dic ergo nobis quid tibi videtur, licet censum dare Cæsari, an non?
18 Cognita autem Jesus nequitia eorum, ait: Quid me tentatis, hypocritæ?
19 ostendite mihi numisma census. At illi obtulerunt ei denarium.
20 Et ait illis Jesus: Cujus est imago hæc, et superscriptio?
21 Dicunt ei: Cæsaris. Tunc ait illis: Reddite ergo quæ sunt Cæsaris, Cæsari: et quæ sunt Dei, Deo.
22 Et audientes mirati sunt, et relicto eo abierunt.

23 In illo die accesserunt ad eum sadducæi, qui dicunt non esse resurrectionem: et interrogaverunt eum,
24 dicentes: Magister, Moyses dixit: Si quis mortuus fuerit non habens filium, ut ducat frater ejus uxorem illius, et suscitet semen fratri suo.
25 Erant autem apud nos septem fratres: et primus, uxore ducta, defunctus est: et non habens semen, reliquit uxorem suam fratri suo.
26 Similiter secundus, et tertius usque ad septimum.
27 Novissime autem omnium et mulier defuncta est.
28 In resurrectione ergo cujus erit de septem uxor? omnes enim habuerunt eam.
29 Respondens autem Jesus, ait illis: Erratis nescientes Scripturas, neque virtutem Dei.
30 In resurrectione enim neque nubent, neque nubentur: sed erunt sicut angeli Dei in cælo.
31 De resurrectione autem mortuorum non legistis quod dictum est a Deo dicente vobis:
32 Ego sum Deus Abraham, et Deus Isaac, et Deus Jacob? Non est Deus mortuorum, sed viventium.
33 Et audientes turbæ, mirabantur in doctrina ejus.

34 Pharisæi autem audientes quod silentium imposuisset sadducæis, convenerunt in unum:
35 et interrogavit eum unus ex eis legis doctor, tentans eum:
36 Magister, quod est mandatum magnum in lege?
37 Ait illi Jesus: Diliges Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et in tota anima tua, et in tota mente tua.
38 Hoc est maximum, et primum mandatum.
39 Secundum autem simile est huic: Diliges proximum tuum, sicut teipsum.
40 In his duobus mandatis universa lex pendet, et prophetæ.
41 Congregatis autem pharisæis, interrogavit eos Jesus,
42 dicens: Quid vobis videtur de Christo? cujus filius est? Dicunt ei: David.
43 Ait illis: Quomodo ergo David in spiritu vocat eum Dominum, dicens:
44 Dixit Dominus Domino meo: Sede a dextris meis, donec ponam inimicos tuos scabellum pedum tuorum?
45 Si ergo David vocat eum Dominum, quomodo filius ejus est?
46 Et nemo poterat ei respondere verbum: neque ausus fuit quisquam ex illa die eum amplius interrogare.


# Κατὰ Ματθαῖον 22 (Textus Receptus)

1 Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς πάλιν εἶπεν ἐν παραβολαῖς αὐτοῖς λέγων:
2 ὡμοιώθη ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ἀνθρώπῳ βασιλεῖ, ὅστις ἐποίησεν γάμους τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ.
3 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ καλέσαι τοὺς κεκλημένους εἰς τοὺς γάμους, καὶ οὐκ ἤθελον ἐλθεῖν.
4 πάλιν ἀπέστειλεν ἄλλους δούλους λέγων: εἴπατε τοῖς κεκλημένοις: ἰδοὺ τὸ ἄριστόν μου ἡτοίμακα, οἱ ταῦροί μου καὶ τὰ σιτιστὰ τεθυμένα, καὶ πάντα ἕτοιμα: δεῦτε εἰς τοὺς γάμους.
5 οἱ δὲ ἀμελήσαντες ἀπῆλθον, ὃς μὲν εἰς τὸν ἴδιον ἀγρόν, ὃς δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν ἐμπορίαν αὐτοῦ:
6 οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ κρατήσαντες τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ ὕβρισαν καὶ ἀπέκτειναν.
7 ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ὠργίσθη, καὶ πέμψας τὰ στρατεύματα αὐτοῦ ἀπώλεσεν τοὺς φονεῖς ἐκείνους καὶ τὴν πόλιν αὐτῶν ἐνέπρησεν.
8 τότε λέγει τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ: ὁ μὲν γάμος ἕτοιμός ἐστιν, οἱ δὲ κεκλημένοι οὐκ ἦσαν ἄξιοι:
9 πορεύεσθε οὖν ἐπὶ τὰς διεξόδους τῶν ὁδῶν, καὶ ὅσους ἐὰν εὕρητε καλέσατε εἰς τοὺς γάμους.
10 καὶ ἐξελθόντες οἱ δοῦλοι ἐκεῖνοι εἰς τὰς ὁδοὺς συνήγαγον πάντας οὓς εὗρον, πονηρούς τε καὶ ἀγαθούς, καὶ ἐπλήσθη ὁ γάμος ἀνακειμένων.
11 εἰσελθὼν δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς θεάσασθαι τοὺς ἀνακειμένους εἶδεν ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπον οὐκ ἐνδεδυμένον ἔνδυμα γάμου:
12 καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ: ἑταῖρε, πῶς εἰσῆλθες ὧδε μὴ ἔχων ἔνδυμα γάμου; ὁ δὲ ἐφιμώθη.
13 τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς εἶπεν τοῖς διακόνοις: δήσαντες αὐτοῦ πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ἐκβάλετε αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ σκότος τὸ ἐξώτερον: ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁ κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς τῶν ὀδόντων.
14 πολλοὶ γάρ εἰσιν κλητοὶ ὀλίγοι δὲ ἐκλεκτοί.

15 Τότε πορευθέντες οἱ Φαρισαῖοι συμβούλιον ἔλαβον ὅπως αὐτὸν παγιδεύσωσιν ἐν λόγῳ.
16 καὶ ἀποστέλλουσιν αὐτῷ τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτῶν μετὰ τῶν Ἡρῳδιανῶν λέγοντες: διδάσκαλε, οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἀληθὴς εἶ καὶ τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ διδάσκεις, καὶ οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός, οὐ γὰρ βλέπεις εἰς πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπων:
17 εἰπὲ οὖν ἡμῖν, τί σοι δοκεῖ: ἔξεστιν δοῦναι κῆνσον Καίσαρι ἢ οὔ;
18 γνοὺς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς τὴν πονηρίαν αὐτῶν εἶπεν: τί με πειράζετε, ὑποκριταί;
19 ἐπιδείξατέ μοι τὸ νόμισμα τοῦ κήνσου. οἱ δὲ προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ δηνάριον.
20 καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς: Τίνος ἡ εἰκὼν αὕτη καὶ ἡ ἐπιγραφή;
21 λέγουσιν: αὐτῷ Καίσαρος. τότε λέγει αὐτοῖς: ἀπόδοτε οὖν τὰ Καίσαρος Καίσαρι καὶ τὰ τοῦ θεοῦ τῷ θεῷ.
22 καὶ ἀκούσαντες ἐθαύμασαν, καὶ ἀφέντες αὐτὸν ἀπῆλθαν.

23 Ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ προσῆλθον αὐτῷ Σαδδουκαῖοι, λέγοντες μὴ εἶναι ἀνάστασιν, καὶ ἐπηρώτησαν αὐτὸν
24 λέγοντες: διδάσκαλε, Μωϋσῆς εἶπεν: ἐάν τις ἀποθάνῃ μὴ ἔχων τέκνα, ἐπιγαμβρεύσει ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀναστήσει σπέρμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ.
25 ἦσαν δὲ παρ' ἡμῖν ἑπτὰ ἀδελφοί, καὶ ὁ πρῶτος γήμας ἐτελεύτησεν, καὶ μὴ ἔχων σπέρμα ἀφῆκεν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ.
26 ὁμοίως καὶ ὁ δεύτερος καὶ ὁ τρίτος, ἕως τῶν ἑπτά.
27 ὕστερον δὲ πάντων ἀπέθανεν ἡ γυνή.
28 ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει οὖν τίνος τῶν ἑπτὰ ἔσται γυνή; πάντες γὰρ ἔσχον αὐτήν.
29 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: πλανᾶσθε, μὴ εἰδότες τὰς γραφὰς μηδὲ τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ θεοῦ.
30 ἐν γὰρ τῇ ἀναστάσει οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται, ἀλλ' ὡς ἄγγελοι ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ εἰσιν.
31 περὶ δὲ τῆς ἀναστάσεως τῶν νεκρῶν οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε τὸ ῥηθὲν ὑμῖν ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ λέγοντος:
32 ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ καὶ ὁ θεὸς Ἰσαὰκ καὶ ὁ θεὸς Ἰακώβ; οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ θεὸς νεκρῶν ἀλλὰ ζώντων.
33 καὶ ἀκούσαντες οἱ ὄχλοι ἐξεπλήσσοντο ἐπὶ τῇ διδαχῇ αὐτοῦ.

34 Οἱ δὲ Φαρισαῖοι ἀκούσαντες ὅτι ἐφίμωσεν τοὺς Σαδδουκαίους συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό,
35 καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν νομικὸς πειράζων αὐτόν:
36 διδάσκαλε, ποία ἐντολὴ μεγάλη ἐν τῷ νόμῳ;
37 ὁ δὲ ἔφη αὐτῷ: ἀγαπήσεις κύριον τὸν θεόν σου ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ καρδίᾳ σου καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ψυχῇ σου καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ διανοίᾳ σου.
38 αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ μεγάλη καὶ πρώτη ἐντολή.
39 δευτέρα δὲ ὁμοία αὐτῇ: ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν.
40 ἐν ταύταις ταῖς δυσὶν ἐντολαῖς ὅλος ὁ νόμος κρέμαται καὶ οἱ προφῆται.
41 Συνηγμένων δὲ τῶν Φαρισαίων ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτοὺς ὁ Ἰησοῦς
42 λέγων: τί ὑμῖν δοκεῖ περὶ τοῦ Χριστοῦ; τίνος υἱός ἐστιν; λέγουσιν αὐτῷ: τοῦ Δαυίδ.
43 λέγει αὐτοῖς: πῶς οὖν Δαυὶδ ἐν πνεύματι καλεῖ αὐτὸν κύριον λέγων:
44 εἶπεν κύριος τῷ κυρίῳ μου: κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου.
45 εἰ οὖν Δαυὶδ καλεῖ αὐτὸν κύριον, πῶς υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἐστιν;
46 καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο ἀποκριθῆναι αὐτῷ λόγον, οὐδὲ ἐτόλμησέν τις ἀπ' ἐκείνης τῆς ἡμέρας ἐπερωτῆσαι αὐτὸν οὐκέτι.
