# Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27 (RSVCE)

### Jesus Brought before Pilate
1 When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death;
2 and they bound him and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor.
### The Suicide of Judas
3 When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
4 saying, “I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.”
5 And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself.
6 But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.”
7 So they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
9 Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,
10 and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”
### Pilate Questions Jesus
11 Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said to him, “You have said so.”
12 But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.
13 Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?”
14 But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly.
### Barabbas or Jesus?
15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.
16 And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barabʹbas.
17 So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabʹbas or Jesus who is called Christ?”
18 For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up.
19 Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over him today in a dream.”
20 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabʹbas and destroy Jesus.
21 The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabʹbas.”
22 Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified.”
23 And he said, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified.”
### Pilate Hands Jesus over to Be Crucified
24 So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this righteous man’s blood; see to it yourselves.”
25 And all the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”
26 Then he released for them Barabʹbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.
### The Soldiers Mock Jesus
27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium, and they gathered the whole battalion before him.
28 And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him,
29 and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
30 And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
### The Crucifixion of Jesus
32 As they were marching out, they came upon a man of Cyreʹne, Simon by name; this man they compelled to carry his cross.
33 And when they came to a place called Golʹgotha (which means the place of a skull),
34 they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.
35 And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots;
36 then they sat down and kept watch over him there.
37 And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus the King of the Jews.”
38 Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.
39 And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads
40 and saying, “You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.”
41 So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,
42 “He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
43 He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ”
44 And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.
### The Death of Jesus
45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, laʹma sabach-thaʹni?” that is, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”
47 And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “This man is calling Eliʹjah.”
48 And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
49 But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Eliʹjah will come to save him.”
50 And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.
51 And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split;
52 the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,
53 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many.
54 When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe, and said, “Truly this was the Son of God!”
55 There were also many women there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him;
56 among whom were Mary Magʹdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebʹedee.
### The Burial of Jesus
57 When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimatheʹa, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus.
58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
59 And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud,
60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
61 Mary Magʹdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the sepulchre.
### The Guard at the Tomb
62 Next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
63 and said, “Sir, we remember how that imposter said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise again.’
64 Therefore order the sepulchre to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.”
65 Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.”
66 So they went and made the sepulchre secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.


# Evangelium Secundum Matthaeum 27 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Mane autem facto, consilium inierunt omnes principes sacerdotum et seniores populi adversus Jesum, ut eum morti traderent.
2 Et vinctum adduxerunt eum, et tradiderunt Pontio Pilato præsidi.
3 Tunc videns Judas, qui eum tradidit, quod damnatus esset, pœnitentia ductus, retulit triginta argenteos principibus sacerdotum, et senioribus,
4 dicens: Peccavi, tradens sanguinem justum. At illi dixerunt: Quid ad nos? tu videris.
5 Et projectis argenteis in templo, recessit: et abiens laqueo se suspendit.
6 Principes autem sacerdotum, acceptis argenteis, dixerunt: Non licet eos mittere in corbonam: quia pretium sanguinis est.
7 Consilio autem inito, emerunt ex illis agrum figuli, in sepulturam peregrinorum.
8 Propter hoc vocatus est ager ille, Haceldama, hoc est, Ager sanguinis, usque in hodiernum diem.
9 Tunc impletum est quod dictum est per Jeremiam prophetam, dicentem: Et acceperunt triginta argenteos pretium appretiati, quem appretiaverunt a filiis Israël:
10 et dederunt eos in agrum figuli, sicut constituit mihi Dominus.

11 Jesus autem stetit ante præsidem, et interrogavit eum præses, dicens: Tu es rex Judæorum? Dicit illi Jesus: Tu dicis.
12 Et cum accusaretur a principibus sacerdotum et senioribus, nihil respondit.
13 Tunc dicit illi Pilatus: Non audis quanta adversum te dicunt testimonia?
14 Et non respondit ei ad ullum verbum, ita ut miraretur præses vehementer.
15 Per diem autem solemnem consueverat præses populo dimittere unum vinctum, quem voluissent:
16 habebat autem tunc vinctum insignem, qui dicebatur Barrabas.
17 Congregatis ergo illis, dixit Pilatus: Quem vultis dimittam vobis: Barabbam, an Jesum, qui dicitur Christus?
18 Sciebat enim quod per invidiam tradidissent eum.
19 Sedente autem illo pro tribunali, misit ad eum uxor ejus, dicens: Nihil tibi, et justo illi: multa enim passa sum hodie per visum propter eum.
20 Principes autem sacerdotum et seniores persuaserunt populis ut peterent Barabbam, Jesum vero perderent.
21 Respondens autem præses, ait illis: Quem vultis vobis de duobus dimitti? At illi dixerunt: Barabbam.
22 Dicit illis Pilatus: Quid igitur faciam de Jesu, qui dicitur Christus?
23 Dicunt omnes: Crucifigatur. Ait illis præses: Quid enim mali fecit? At illi magis clamabant dicentes: Crucifigatur.
24 Videns autem Pilatus quia nihil proficeret, sed magis tumultus fieret: accepta aqua, lavit manus coram populo, dicens: Innocens ego sum a sanguine justi hujus: vos videritis.
25 Et respondens universus populus, dixit: Sanguis ejus super nos, et super filios nostros.
26 Tunc dimisit illis Barabbam: Jesum autem flagellatum tradidit eis ut crucifigeretur.

27 Tunc milites præsidis suscipientes Jesum in prætorium, congregaverunt ad eum universam cohortem:
28 et exuentes eum, chlamydem coccineam circumdederunt ei,
29 et plectentes coronam de spinis, posuerunt super caput ejus, et arundinem in dextera ejus. Et genu flexo ante eum, illudebant ei, dicentes: Ave rex Judæorum.
30 Et exspuentes in eum, acceperunt arundinem, et percutiebant caput ejus.
31 Et postquam illuserunt ei, exuerunt eum chlamyde, et induerunt eum vestimentis ejus, et duxerunt eum ut crucifigerent.
32 Exeuntes autem invenerunt hominem Cyrenæum, nomine Simonem: hunc angariaverunt ut tolleret crucem ejus.
33 Et venerunt in locum qui dicitur Golgotha, quod est Calvariæ locus.
34 Et dederunt ei vinum bibere cum felle mistum. Et cum gustasset, noluit bibere.
35 Postquam autem crucifixerunt eum, diviserunt vestimenta ejus, sortem mittentes: ut impleretur quod dictum est per prophetam dicentem: Diviserunt sibi vestimenta mea, et super vestem meam miserunt sortem.

36 Et sedentes servabant eum.
37 Et imposuerunt super caput ejus causam ipsius scriptam: Hic est Jesus rex Judæorum.
38 Tunc crucifixi sunt cum eo duo latrones: unus a dextris, et unus a sinistris.
39 Prætereuntes autem blasphemabant eum moventes capita sua,
40 et dicentes: Vah! qui destruis templum Dei, et in triduo illud reædificas: salva temetipsum: si Filius Dei es, descende de cruce.
41 Similiter et principes sacerdotum illudentes cum scribis et senioribus dicebant:
42 Alios salvos fecit, seipsum non potest salvum facere: si rex Israël est, descendat nunc de cruce, et credimus ei:
43 confidit in Deo: liberet nunc, si vult eum: dixit enim: Quia Filius Dei sum.
44 Idipsum autem et latrones, qui crucifixi erant cum eo, improperabant ei.

45 A sexta autem hora tenebræ factæ sunt super universam terram usque ad horam nonam.
46 Et circa horam nonam clamavit Jesus voce magna, dicens: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? hoc est: Deus meus, Deus meus, ut quid dereliquisti me?
47 Quidam autem illic stantes, et audientes, dicebant: Eliam vocat iste.
48 Et continuo currens unus ex eis, acceptam spongiam implevit aceto, et imposuit arundini, et dabat ei bibere.
49 Ceteri vero dicebant: Sine, videamus an veniat Elias liberans eum.
50 Jesus autem iterum clamans voce magna, emisit spiritum.
51 Et ecce velum templi scissum est in duas partes a summo usque deorsum: et terra mota est, et petræ scissæ sunt,
52 et monumenta aperta sunt: et multa corpora sanctorum, qui dormierant, surrexerunt.
53 Et exeuntes de monumentis post resurrectionem ejus, venerunt in sanctam civitatem, et apparuerunt multis.
54 Centurio autem, et qui cum eo erant, custodientes Jesum, viso terræmotu, et his quæ fiebant, timuerunt valde, dicentes: Vere Filius Dei erat iste.

55 Erant autem ibi mulieres multæ a longe, quæ secutæ erant Jesum a Galilæa, ministrantes ei:
56 inter quas erat Maria Magdalene, et Maria Jacobi, et Joseph mater, et mater filiorum Zebedæi.
57 Cum autem sero factum esset, venit quidam homo dives ab Arimathæa, nomine Joseph, qui et ipse discipulus erat Jesu:
58 hic accessit ad Pilatum, et petiit corpus Jesu. Tunc Pilatus jussit reddi corpus.
59 Et accepto corpore, Joseph involvit illud in sindone munda,
60 et posuit illud in monumento suo novo, quod exciderat in petra. Et advolvit saxum magnum ad ostium monumenti, et abiit.
61 Erant autem ibi Maria Magdalene, et altera Maria, sedentes contra sepulchrum.

62 Altera autem die, quæ est post Parasceven, convenerunt principes sacerdotum et pharisæi ad Pilatum,
63 dicentes: Domine, recordati sumus, quia seductor ille dixit adhuc vivens: Post tres dies resurgam.
64 Jube ergo custodiri sepulchrum usque in diem tertium: ne forte veniant discipuli ejus, et furentur eum, et dicant plebi: Surrexit a mortuis: et erit novissimus error pejor priore.
65 Ait illis Pilatus: Habetis custodiam, ite, custodite sicut scitis.
66 Illi autem abeuntes, munierunt sepulchrum, signantes lapidem, cum custodibus.


# Κατὰ Ματθαῖον 27 (Textus Receptus)

1 Πρωΐας δὲ γενομένης συμβούλιον ἔλαβον πάντες οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τοῦ λαοῦ κατὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ, ὥστε θανατῶσαι αὐτόν.
2 καὶ δήσαντες αὐτὸν ἀπήγαγον καὶ παρέδωκαν Πιλάτῳ τῷ ἡγεμόνι.
3 Τότε ἰδὼν Ἰούδας ὁ παραδιδοὺς αὐτὸν ὅτι κατεκρίθη μεταμεληθεὶς ἔστρεψεν τὰ τριάκοντα ἀργύρια τοῖς ἀρχιερεῦσιν καὶ πρεσβυτέροις
4 λέγων: ἥμαρτον παραδοὺς αἷμα ἀθῷον. οἱ δὲ εἶπαν: τί πρὸς ἡμᾶς; σὺ ὄψῃ.
5 καὶ ῥίψας τὰ ἀργύρια εἰς τὸν ναὸν ἀνεχώρησεν, καὶ ἀπελθὼν ἀπήγξατο.
6 οἱ δὲ ἀρχιερεῖς λαβόντες τὰ ἀργύρια εἶπαν: οὐκ ἔξεστιν βαλεῖν αὐτὰ εἰς τὸν κορβανᾶν, ἐπεὶ τιμὴ αἵματός ἐστιν.
7 συμβούλιον δὲ λαβόντες ἠγόρασαν ἐξ αὐτῶν τὸν ἀγρὸν τοῦ κεραμέως εἰς ταφὴν τοῖς ξένοις.
8 διὸ ἐκλήθη ὁ ἀγρὸς ἐκεῖνος ἀγρὸς αἵματος ἕως τῆς σήμερον.
9 τότε ἐπληρώθη τὸ ῥηθὲν διὰ Ἰερεμίου τοῦ προφήτου λέγοντος: καὶ ἔλαβον τὰ τριάκοντα ἀργύρια, τὴν τιμὴν τοῦ τετιμημένου ὃν ἐτιμήσαντο ἀπὸ υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ,
10 καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτὰ εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν τοῦ κεραμέως, καθὰ συνέταξέν μοι κύριος.

11 Ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς ἐστάθη ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ ἡγεμόνος: καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτὸν ὁ ἡγεμὼν λέγων: σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων; ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς ἔφη, σὺ λέγεις.
12 καὶ ἐν τῷ κατηγορεῖσθαι αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀρχιερέων καὶ πρεσβυτέρων οὐδὲν ἀπεκρίνατο.
13 τότε λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Πιλᾶτος: οὐκ ἀκούεις πόσα σου καταμαρτυροῦσιν;
14 καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ πρὸς οὐδὲ ἓν ῥῆμα, ὥστε θαυμάζειν τὸν ἡγεμόνα λίαν.
15 Κατὰ δὲ ἑορτὴν εἰώθει ὁ ἡγεμὼν ἀπολύειν ἕνα τῷ ὄχλῳ δέσμιον ὃν ἤθελον.
16 εἶχον δὲ τότε δέσμιον ἐπίσημον, λεγόμενον Ἰησοῦν Βαραββᾶν.
17 συνηγμένων οὖν αὐτῶν εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ Πιλᾶτος: τίνα θέλετε ἀπολύσω ὑμῖν, Ἰησοῦν τὸν Βαραββᾶν ἢ Ἰησοῦν τὸν λεγόμενον Χριστόν;
18 ᾔδει γὰρ ὅτι διὰ φθόνον παρέδωκαν αὐτόν.
19 καθημένου δὲ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματος ἀπέστειλεν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ λέγουσα: μηδὲν σοὶ καὶ τῷ δικαίῳ ἐκείνῳ: πολλὰ γὰρ ἔπαθον σήμερον κατ' ὄναρ δι' αὐτόν.
20 οἱ δὲ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ἔπεισαν τοὺς ὄχλους ἵνα αἰτήσωνται τὸν Βαραββᾶν, τὸν δὲ Ἰησοῦν ἀπολέσωσιν.
21 ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ ἡγεμὼν εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: τίνα θέλετε ἀπὸ τῶν δύο ἀπολύσω ὑμῖν; οἱ δὲ εἶπαν: τὸν Βαραββᾶν.
22 λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Πιλᾶτος: τί οὖν ποιήσω Ἰησοῦν τὸν λεγόμενον Χριστόν; λέγουσιν πάντες: σταυρωθήτω.
23 ὁ δὲ ἔφη: τί γὰρ κακὸν ἐποίησεν; οἱ δὲ περισσῶς ἔκραζον λέγοντες: σταυρωθήτω.
24 ἰδὼν δὲ ὁ Πιλᾶτος ὅτι οὐδὲν ὠφελεῖ ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον θόρυβος γίνεται, λαβὼν ὕδωρ ἀπενίψατο τὰς χεῖρας ἀπέναντι τοῦ ὄχλου, λέγων: ἀθῷός εἰμι ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τούτου: ὑμεῖς ὄψεσθε.
25 καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς πᾶς ὁ λαὸς εἶπεν: τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐφ' ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα ἡμῶν.
26 τότε ἀπέλυσεν αὐτοῖς τὸν Βαραββᾶν, τὸν δὲ Ἰησοῦν φραγελλώσας παρέδωκεν ἵνα σταυρωθῇ.

27 Τότε οἱ στρατιῶται τοῦ ἡγεμόνος παραλαβόντες τὸν Ἰησοῦν εἰς τὸ πραιτώριον συνήγαγον ἐπ' αὐτὸν ὅλην τὴν σπεῖραν.
28 καὶ ἐκδύσαντες αὐτὸν χλαμύδα κοκκίνην περιέθηκαν αὐτῷ,
29 καὶ πλέξαντες στέφανον ἐξ ἀκανθῶν ἐπέθηκαν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ κάλαμον ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ, καὶ γονυπετήσαντες ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ ἐνέπαιξαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες: χαῖρε βασιλεῦ τῶν Ἰουδαίων,
30 καὶ ἐμπτύσαντες εἰς αὐτὸν ἔλαβον τὸν κάλαμον καὶ ἔτυπτον εἰς τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ.
31 καὶ ὅτε ἐνέπαιξαν αὐτῷ, ἐξέδυσαν αὐτὸν τὴν χλαμύδα καὶ ἐνέδυσαν αὐτὸν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ σταυρῶσαι.
32 Ἐξερχόμενοι δὲ εὗρον ἄνθρωπον Κυρηναῖον, ὀνόματι Σίμωνα: τοῦτον ἠγγάρευσαν ἵνα ἄρῃ τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ.
33 καὶ ἐλθόντες εἰς τόπον λεγόμενον Γολγοθᾶ, ὅ ἐστιν κρανίου τόπος λεγόμενος,
34 ἔδωκαν αὐτῷ πιεῖν οἶνον μετὰ χολῆς μεμιγμένον: καὶ γευσάμενος οὐκ ἠθέλησεν πιεῖν.
35 σταυρώσαντες δὲ αὐτὸν διεμερίσαντο τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ βάλλοντες κλῆρον,

36 καὶ καθήμενοι ἐτήρουν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ.
37 καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπάνω τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ τὴν αἰτίαν αὐτοῦ γεγραμμένην: οὗτός ἐστιν Ἰησοῦς ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων.
38 Τότε σταυροῦνται σὺν αὐτῷ δύο λῃσταί, εἷς ἐκ δεξιῶν καὶ εἷς ἐξ εὐωνύμων.
39 οἱ δὲ παραπορευόμενοι ἐβλασφήμουν αὐτὸν, κινοῦντες τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν
40 καὶ λέγοντες: ὁ καταλύων τὸν ναὸν καὶ ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις οἰκοδομῶν, σῶσον σεαυτόν, εἰ υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ θεοῦ, καὶ κατάβηθι ἀπὸ τοῦ σταυροῦ.
41 ὁμοίως καὶ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς ἐμπαίζοντες μετὰ τῶν γραμματέων καὶ πρεσβυτέρων ἔλεγον:
42 ἄλλους ἔσωσεν, ἑαυτὸν οὐ δύναται σῶσαι: βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ ἐστιν, καταβάτω νῦν ἀπὸ τοῦ σταυροῦ καὶ πιστεύσομεν ἐπ' αὐτόν:
43 πέποιθεν ἐπὶ τὸν θεόν, ῥυσάσθω νῦν εἰ θέλει αὐτόν: εἶπεν γὰρ ὅτι θεοῦ εἰμι υἱός.
44 τὸ δ' αὐτὸ καὶ οἱ λῃσταὶ οἱ συσταυρωθέντες σὺν αὐτῷ ὠνείδιζον αὐτόν.

45 Ἀπὸ δὲ ἕκτης ὥρας σκότος ἐγένετο ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἕως ὥρας ἐνάτης.
46 περὶ δὲ τὴν ἐνάτην ὥραν ἀνεβόησεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς φωνῇ μεγάλῃ λέγων: ηλι ηλι λεμα σαβαχθανι τοῦτ' ἔστιν: θεέ μου θεέ μου, ἱνατί με ἐγκατέλιπες;
47 τινὲς δὲ τῶν ἐκεῖ ἑστηκότων ἀκούσαντες ἔλεγον ὅτι Ἠλίαν φωνεῖ οὗτος.
48 καὶ εὐθέως δραμὼν εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν καὶ λαβὼν σπόγγον πλήσας τε ὄξους καὶ περιθεὶς καλάμῳ ἐπότιζεν αὐτόν.
49 οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ ἔλεγον: ἄφες ἴδωμεν εἰ ἔρχεται Ἠλίας σώσων αὐτόν.
50 Ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς πάλιν κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ἀφῆκεν τὸ πνεῦμα.
51 καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ ναοῦ ἐσχίσθη ἀπ' ἄνωθεν ἕως κάτω εἰς δύο, καὶ ἡ γῆ ἐσείσθη, καὶ αἱ πέτραι ἐσχίσθησαν,
52 καὶ τὰ μνημεῖα ἀνεῴχθησαν καὶ πολλὰ σώματα τῶν κεκοιμημένων ἁγίων ἠγέρθησαν:
53 καὶ ἐξελθόντες ἐκ τῶν μνημείων μετὰ τὴν ἔγερσιν αὐτοῦ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν ἁγίαν πόλιν καὶ ἐνεφανίσθησαν πολλοῖς.
54 ὁ δὲ ἑκατόνταρχος καὶ οἱ μετ' αὐτοῦ τηροῦντες τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἰδόντες τὸν σεισμὸν καὶ τὰ γενόμενα ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα, λέγοντες: ἀληθῶς θεοῦ υἱὸς ἦν οὗτος.

55 Ἦσαν δὲ ἐκεῖ γυναῖκες πολλαὶ ἀπὸ μακρόθεν θεωροῦσαι, αἵτινες ἠκολούθησαν τῷ Ἰησοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας διακονοῦσαι αὐτῷ:
56 ἐν αἷς ἦν Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ καὶ Μαρία ἡ τοῦ Ἰακώβου καὶ Ἰωσὴφ μήτηρ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ τῶν υἱῶν Ζεβεδαίου.
57 Ὀψίας δὲ γενομένης ἦλθεν ἄνθρωπος πλούσιος ἀπὸ Ἁριμαθαίας, τοὔνομα Ἰωσήφ, ὃς καὶ αὐτὸς ἐμαθητεύθη τῷ Ἰησοῦ:
58 οὗτος προσελθὼν τῷ Πιλάτῳ ᾐτήσατο τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ. τότε ὁ Πιλᾶτος ἐκέλευσεν ἀποδοθῆναι.
59 καὶ λαβὼν τὸ σῶμα ὁ Ἰωσὴφ ἐνετύλιξεν αὐτὸ ἐν σινδόνι καθαρᾷ,
60 καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὸ ἐν τῷ καινῷ αὐτοῦ μνημείῳ ὃ ἐλατόμησεν ἐν τῇ πέτρᾳ, καὶ προσκυλίσας λίθον μέγαν τῇ θύρᾳ τοῦ μνημείου ἀπῆλθεν.
61 ἦν δὲ ἐκεῖ Μαριὰμ ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ καὶ ἡ ἄλλη Μαρία, καθήμεναι ἀπέναντι τοῦ τάφου.

62 Τῇ δὲ ἐπαύριον, ἥτις ἐστὶν μετὰ τὴν παρασκευήν, συνήχθησαν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι πρὸς Πιλᾶτον
63 λέγοντες: κύριε, ἐμνήσθημεν ὅτι ἐκεῖνος ὁ πλάνος εἶπεν ἔτι ζῶν, μετὰ τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἐγείρομαι.
64 κέλευσον οὖν ἀσφαλισθῆναι τὸν τάφον ἕως τῆς τρίτης ἡμέρας, μήποτε ἐλθόντες οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ κλέψωσιν αὐτὸν καὶ εἴπωσιν τῷ λαῷ: ἠγέρθη ἀπὸ τῶν νεκρῶν, καὶ ἔσται ἡ ἐσχάτη πλάνη χείρων τῆς πρώτης.
65 ἔφη αὐτοῖς ὁ Πιλᾶτος: ἔχετε κουστωδίαν: ὑπάγετε ἀσφαλίσασθε ὡς οἴδατε.
66 οἱ δὲ πορευθέντες ἠσφαλίσαντο τὸν τάφον, σφραγίσαντες τὸν λίθον μετὰ τῆς κουστωδίας.
