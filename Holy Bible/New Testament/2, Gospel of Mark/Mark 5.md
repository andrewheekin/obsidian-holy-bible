# Gospel According to Saint Mark 5 (RSVCE)

### Jesus Heals the Gerasene Demoniac
1 They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerʹasenes.
2 And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
3 who lived among the tombs; and no one could bind him any more, even with a chain;
4 for he had often been bound with fetters and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the fetters he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him.
5 Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and bruising himself with stones.
6 And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped him;
7 and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.”
8 For he had said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”
9 And Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He replied, “My name is Legion; for we are many.”
10 And he begged him eagerly not to send them out of the country.
11 Now a great herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside;
12 and they begged him, “Send us to the swine, let us enter them.”
13 So he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea.
14 The herdsmen fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened.
15 And they came to Jesus, and saw the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had had the legion; and they were afraid.
16 And those who had seen it told what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine.
17 And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their neighborhood.
18 And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him.
19 But he refused, and said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”
20 And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapʹolis how much Jesus had done for him; and all men marveled.
### A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed
21 And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him; and he was beside the sea.
22 Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jaʹirus by name; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
23 and besought him, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.”
24 And he went with him. And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.
25 And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years,
26 and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse.
27 She had heard the reports about Jesus, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.
28 For she said, “If I touch even his garments, I shall be made well.”
29 And immediately the hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.
30 And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him, immediately turned about in the crowd, and said, “Who touched my garments?”
31 And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, ‘Who touched me?’ ”
32 And he looked around to see who had done it.
33 But the woman, knowing what had been done to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him, and told him the whole truth.
34 And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”
35 While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler’s house some who said, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”
36 But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not fear, only believe.”
37 And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
38 When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly.
39 And when he had entered, he said to them, “Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.”
40 And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside, and took the child’s father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was.
41 Taking her by the hand he said to her, “Talʹitha cuʹmi”; which means, “Little girl, I say to you, arise.”
42 And immediately the girl got up and walked; for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were overcome with amazement.
43 And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.


# Evangelium Secundum Marcum 5 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et venerunt trans fretum maris in regionem Gerasenorum.
2 Et exeunti ei de navi, statim occurrit de monumentis homo in spiritu immundo,
3 qui domicilium habebat in monumentis, et neque catenis jam quisquam poterat eum ligare:
4 quoniam sæpe compedibus et catenis vinctus, dirupisset catenas, et compedes comminuisset, et nemo poterat eum domare:
5 et semper die ac nocte in monumentis, et in montibus erat, clamans, et concidens se lapidibus.
6 Videns autem Jesum a longe, cucurrit, et adoravit eum:
7 et clamans voce magna dixit: Quid mihi et tibi, Jesu Fili Dei altissimi? adjuro te per Deum, ne me torqueas.
8 Dicebat enim illi: Exi spiritus immunde ab homine.
9 Et interrogabat eum: Quod tibi nomen est? Et dicit ei: Legio mihi nomen est, quia multi sumus.
10 Et deprecabatur eum multum, ne se expelleret extra regionem.
11 Erat autem ibi circa montem grex porcorum magnus, pascens.
12 Et deprecabantur eum spiritus, dicentes: Mitte nos in porcos ut in eos introëamus.
13 Et concessit eis statim Jesus. Et exeuntes spiritus immundi introierunt in porcos: et magno impetu grex præcipitatus est in mare ad duo millia, et suffocati sunt in mari.
14 Qui autem pascebant eos, fugerunt, et nuntiaverunt in civitatem et in agros. Et egressi sunt videre quid esset factum:
15 et veniunt ad Jesum: et vident illum qui a dæmonio vexabatur, sedentem, vestitum, et sanæ mentis, et timuerunt.
16 Et narraverunt illis, qui viderant, qualiter factum esset ei qui dæmonium habuerat, et de porcis.
17 Et rogare cœperunt eum ut discederet de finibus eorum.
18 Cumque ascenderet navim, cœpit illum deprecari, qui a dæmonio vexatus fuerat, ut esset cum illo,
19 et non admisit eum, sed ait illi: Vade in domum tuam ad tuos, et annuntia illis quanta tibi Dominus fecerit, et misertus sit tui.
20 Et abiit, et cœpit prædicare in Decapoli, quanta sibi fecisset Jesus: et omnes mirabantur.

21 Et cum transcendisset Jesus in navi rursum trans fretum, convenit turba multa ad eum, et erat circa mare.
22 Et venit quidam de archisynagogis nomine Jairus, et videns eum procidit ad pedes ejus,
23 et deprecabatur eum multum, dicens: Quoniam filia mea in extremis est, veni, impone manum super eam, ut salva sit, et vivat.
24 Et abiit cum illo, et sequebatur eum turba multa, et comprimebant eum.
25 Et mulier, quæ erat in profluvio sanguinis annis duodecim,
26 et fuerat multa perpessa a compluribus medicis: et erogaverat omnia sua, nec quidquam profecerat, sed magis deterius habebat:
27 cum audisset de Jesu, venit in turba retro, et tetigit vestimentum ejus:
28 dicebat enim: Quia si vel vestimentum ejus tetigero, salva ero.
29 Et confestim siccatus est fons sanguinis ejus: et sensit corpore quia sanata esset a plaga.
30 Et statim Jesus in semetipso cognoscens virtutem quæ exierat de illo, conversus ad turbam, aiebat: Quis tetigit vestimenta mea?
31 Et dicebant ei discipuli sui: Vides turbam comprimentem te, et dicis: Quis me tetigit?
32 Et circumspiciebat videre eam, quæ hoc fecerat.
33 Mulier vero timens et tremens, sciens quod factum esset in se, venit et procidit ante eum, et dixit ei omnem veritatem.
34 Ille autem dixit ei: Filia, fides tua te salvam fecit: vade in pace, et esto sana a plaga tua.

35 Adhuc eo loquente, veniunt ab archisynagogo, dicentes: Quia filia tua mortua est: quid ultra vexas magistrum?
36 Jesus autem audito verbo quod dicebatur, ait archisynagogo: Noli timere: tantummodo crede.
37 Et non admisit quemquam se sequi nisi Petrum, et Jacobum, et Joannem fratrem Jacobi.
38 Et veniunt in domum archisynagogi, et videt tumultum, et flentes, et ejulantes multum.
39 Et ingressus, ait illis: Quid turbamini, et ploratis? puella non est mortua, sed dormit.
40 Et irridebant eum. Ipse vero ejectis omnibus assumit patrem, et matrem puellæ, et qui secum erant, et ingreditur ubi puella erat jacens.
41 Et tenens manum puellæ, ait illi: Talitha cumi, quod est interpretatum: Puella (tibi dico), surge.
42 Et confestim surrexit puella, et ambulabat: erat autem annorum duodecim: et obstupuerunt stupore magno.
43 Et præcepit illis vehementer ut nemo id sciret: et dixit dari illi manducare.


# Κατὰ Μᾶρκον 5 (Textus Receptus)

1 Καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὸ πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης εἰς τὴν χώραν τῶν Γερασηνῶν.
2 καὶ ἐξελθόντος αὐτοῦ ἐκ τοῦ πλοίου, εὐθὺς ὑπήντησεν αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν μνημείων ἄνθρωπος ἐν πνεύματι ἀκαθάρτῳ,
3 ὃς τὴν κατοίκησιν εἶχεν ἐν τοῖς μνήμασιν, καὶ οὐδὲ ἁλύσει οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο αὐτὸν δῆσαι,
4 διὰ τὸ αὐτὸν πολλάκις πέδαις καὶ ἁλύσεσιν δεδέσθαι καὶ διεσπάσθαι ὑπ' αὐτοῦ τὰς ἁλύσεις καὶ τὰς πέδας συντετρῖφθαι, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἴσχυεν αὐτὸν δαμάσαι,
5 καὶ διὰ παντὸς νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας ἐν τοῖς μνήμασιν καὶ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν ἦν κράζων καὶ κατακόπτων ἑαυτὸν λίθοις.
6 καὶ ἰδὼν τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν ἔδραμεν καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ,
7 καὶ κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ λέγει: τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί, Ἰησοῦ υἱὲ τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ὑψίστου; ὁρκίζω σε τὸν θεόν, μή με βασανίσῃς.
8 ἔλεγεν γὰρ αὐτῷ: ἔξελθε τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἀκάθαρτον ἐκ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου.
9 καὶ ἐπηρώτα αὐτόν: τί ὄνομά σοι; καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ: λεγιὼν ὄνομά μοι, ὅτι πολλοί ἐσμεν.
10 καὶ παρεκάλει αὐτὸν πολλὰ ἵνα μὴ αὐτὰ ἀποστείλῃ ἔξω τῆς χώρας.
11 ἦν δὲ ἐκεῖ πρὸς τῷ ὄρει ἀγέλη χοίρων μεγάλη βοσκομένη:
12 καὶ παρεκάλεσαν αὐτὸν λέγοντες: πέμψον ἡμᾶς εἰς τοὺς χοίρους, ἵνα εἰς αὐτοὺς εἰσέλθωμεν.
13 καὶ ἐπέτρεψεν αὐτοῖς. καὶ ἐξελθόντα τὰ πνεύματα τὰ ἀκάθαρτα εἰσῆλθον εἰς τοὺς χοίρους, καὶ ὥρμησεν ἡ ἀγέλη κατὰ τοῦ κρημνοῦ εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν, ὡς δισχίλιοι, καὶ ἐπνίγοντο ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ.
14 καὶ οἱ βόσκοντες αὐτοὺς ἔφυγον καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀγρούς: καὶ ἦλθον ἰδεῖν τί ἐστιν τὸ γεγονός.
15 καὶ ἔρχονται πρὸς τὸν Ἰησοῦν, καὶ θεωροῦσιν τὸν δαιμονιζόμενον καθήμενον ἱματισμένον καὶ σωφρονοῦντα, τὸν ἐσχηκότα τὸν λεγιῶνα, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν.
16 καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐτοῖς οἱ ἰδόντες πῶς ἐγένετο τῷ δαιμονιζομένῳ καὶ περὶ τῶν χοίρων.
17 καὶ ἤρξαντο παρακαλεῖν αὐτὸν ἀπελθεῖν ἀπὸ τῶν ὁρίων αὐτῶν.
18 καὶ ἐμβαίνοντος αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ πλοῖον παρεκάλει αὐτὸν ὁ δαιμονισθεὶς ἵνα μετ' αὐτοῦ ᾖ.
19 καὶ οὐκ ἀφῆκεν αὐτόν, ἀλλὰ λέγει αὐτῷ: ὕπαγε εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου πρὸς τοὺς σούς, καὶ ἀπάγγειλον αὐτοῖς ὅσα ὁ κύριός σοι πεποίηκεν καὶ ἠλέησέν σε.
20 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν, καὶ ἤρξατο κηρύσσειν ἐν τῇ Δεκαπόλει ὅσα ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, καὶ πάντες ἐθαύμαζον.

21 Καὶ διαπεράσαντος τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ πάλιν εἰς τὸ πέραν συνήχθη ὄχλος πολὺς ἐπ' αὐτόν, καὶ ἦν παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν.
22 καὶ ἔρχεται εἷς τῶν ἀρχισυναγώγων, ὀνόματι Ἰάϊρος, καὶ ἰδὼν αὐτὸν πίπτει πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ,
23 καὶ παρακαλεῖ αὐτὸν πολλὰ λέγων ὅτι τὸ θυγάτριόν μου ἐσχάτως ἔχει, ἵνα ἐλθὼν ἐπιθῇς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῇ ἵνα σωθῇ καὶ ζήσῃ.
24 καὶ ἀπῆλθεν μετ' αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἠκολούθει αὐτῷ ὄχλος πολύς, καὶ συνέθλιβον αὐτόν.
25 καὶ γυνὴ οὖσα ἐν ῥύσει αἵματος δώδεκα ἔτη,
26 καὶ πολλὰ παθοῦσα ὑπὸ πολλῶν ἰατρῶν καὶ δαπανήσασα τὰ παρ' αὐτῆς πάντα, καὶ μηδὲν ὠφεληθεῖσα ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον εἰς τὸ χεῖρον ἐλθοῦσα,
27 ἀκούσασα περὶ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ, ἐλθοῦσα ἐν τῷ ὄχλῳ ὄπισθεν ἥψατο τοῦ ἱματίου αὐτοῦ:
28 ἔλεγεν γὰρ ὅτι ἐὰν ἅψωμαι κἂν τῶν ἱματίων αὐτοῦ σωθήσομαι.
29 καὶ εὐθὺς ἐξηράνθη ἡ πηγὴ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔγνω τῷ σώματι ὅτι ἴαται ἀπὸ τῆς μάστιγος.
30 καὶ εὐθὺς ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐπιγνοὺς ἐν ἑαυτῷ τὴν ἐξ αὐτοῦ δύναμιν ἐξελθοῦσαν, ἐπιστραφεὶς ἐν τῷ ὄχλῳ ἔλεγεν: τίς μου ἥψατο τῶν ἱματίων;
31 καὶ ἔλεγον αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ: βλέπεις τὸν ὄχλον συνθλίβοντά σε, καὶ λέγεις: τίς μου ἥψατο;
32 καὶ περιεβλέπετο ἰδεῖν τὴν τοῦτο ποιήσασαν.
33 ἡ δὲ γυνὴ φοβηθεῖσα καὶ τρέμουσα, εἰδυῖα ὃ γέγονεν αὐτῇ, ἦλθεν καὶ προσέπεσεν αὐτῷ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀλήθειαν.
34 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῇ: θυγάτηρ, ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε: ὕπαγε εἰς εἰρήνην, καὶ ἴσθι ὑγιὴς ἀπὸ τῆς μάστιγός σου.

35 ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος ἔρχονται ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀρχισυναγώγου λέγοντες ὅτι ἡ θυγάτηρ σου ἀπέθανεν, τί ἔτι σκύλλεις τὸν διδάσκαλον;
36 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς παρακούσας τὸν λόγον λαλούμενον λέγει τῷ ἀρχισυναγώγῳ: μὴ φοβοῦ, μόνον πίστευε.
37 καὶ οὐκ ἀφῆκεν οὐδένα μετ' αὐτοῦ συνακολουθῆσαι εἰ μὴ τὸν Πέτρον καὶ Ἰάκωβον καὶ Ἰωάννην τὸν ἀδελφὸν Ἰακώβου.
38 καὶ ἔρχονται εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ἀρχισυναγώγου, καὶ θεωρεῖ θόρυβον καὶ κλαίοντας καὶ ἀλαλάζοντας πολλά,
39 καὶ εἰσελθὼν λέγει αὐτοῖς: τί θορυβεῖσθε καὶ κλαίετε; τὸ παιδίον οὐκ ἀπέθανεν ἀλλὰ καθεύδει.
40 καὶ κατεγέλων αὐτοῦ. αὐτὸς δὲ ἐκβαλὼν πάντας παραλαμβάνει τὸν πατέρα τοῦ παιδίου καὶ τὴν μητέρα καὶ τοὺς μετ' αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσπορεύεται ὅπου ἦν τὸ παιδίον.
41 καὶ κρατήσας τῆς χειρὸς τοῦ παιδίου λέγει αὐτῇ: ταλιθα κουμ ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον: τὸ κοράσιον, σοὶ λέγω, ἔγειρε.
42 καὶ εὐθὺς ἀνέστη τὸ κοράσιον καὶ περιεπάτει: ἦν γὰρ ἐτῶν δώδεκα: καὶ ἐξέστησαν εὐθὺς ἐκστάσει μεγάλῃ.
43 καὶ διεστείλατο αὐτοῖς πολλὰ ἵνα μηδεὶς γνοῖ τοῦτο, καὶ εἶπεν δοθῆναι αὐτῇ φαγεῖν.
