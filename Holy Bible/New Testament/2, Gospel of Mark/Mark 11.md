# Gospel According to Saint Mark 11 (RSVCE)

### Jesus’ Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem
1 And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethʹphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
2 and said to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it.
3 If any one says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’ ”
4 And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door out in the open street; and they untied it.
5 And those who stood there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”
6 And they told them what Jesus had said; and they let them go.
7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw their garments on it; and he sat upon it.
8 And many spread their garments on the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields.
9 And those who went before and those who followed cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
10 Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming! Hosanna in the highest!”
11 And he entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple; and when he had looked round at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
### Jesus Curses the Fig Tree
12 On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.
13 And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
14 And he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard it.
### Jesus Cleanses the Temple
15 And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons;
16 and he would not allow any one to carry anything through the temple.
17 And he taught, and said to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.”
18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
19 And when evening came they went out of the city.
### The Lesson from the Withered Fig Tree
20 As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots.
21 And Peter remembered and said to him, “Master, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered.”
22 And Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God.
23 Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.
24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you receive it, and you will.
25 And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against any one; so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.”
### Jesus’ Authority Is Questioned
27 And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him,
28 and they said to him, “By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?”
29 Jesus said to them, “I will ask you a question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
30 Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men? Answer me.”
31 And they argued with one another, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
32 But shall we say, ‘From men’?”—they were afraid of the people, for all held that John was a real prophet.
33 So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”


# Evangelium Secundum Marcum 11 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et cum appropinquarent Jerosolymæ et Bethaniæ ad montem Olivarum, mittit duos ex discipulis suis,
2 et ait illis: Ite in castellum, quod contra vos est, et statim introëuntes illuc, invenietis pullum ligatum, super quem nemo adhuc hominum sedit: solvite illum, et adducite.
3 Et si quis vobis dixerit: Quid facitis? dicite, quia Domino necessarius est: et continuo illum dimittet huc.
4 Et abeuntes invenerunt pullum ligatum ante januam foris in bivio: et solvunt eum.
5 Et quidam de illic stantibus dicebant illis: Quid facitis solventes pullum?
6 Qui dixerunt eis sicut præceperat illis Jesus, et dimiserunt eis.
7 Et duxerunt pullum ad Jesum: et imponunt illi vestimenta sua, et sedit super eum.
8 Multi autem vestimenta sua straverunt in via: alii autem frondes cædebant de arboribus, et sternebant in via.
9 Et qui præibant, et qui sequebantur, clamabant, dicentes: Hosanna: benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini:
10 benedictum quod venit regnum patris nostri David: hosanna in excelsis.
11 Et introivit Jerosolymam in templum: et circumspectis omnibus, cum jam vespera esset hora, exiit in Bethaniam cum duodecim.

12 Et alia die cum exirent a Bethania, esuriit.
13 Cumque vidisset a longe ficum habentem folia, venit si quid forte inveniret in ea: et cum venisset ad eam, nihil invenit præter folia: non enim erat tempus ficorum.
14 Et respondens dixit ei: Jam non amplius in æternum ex te fructum quisquam manducet. Et audiebant discipuli ejus.
15 Et veniunt in Jerosolymam. Et cum introisset in templum, cœpit ejicere vendentes et ementes in templo: et mensas numulariorum, et cathedras vendentium columbas evertit:
16 et non sinebat ut quisquam transferret vas per templum:
17 et docebat, dicens eis: Nonne scriptum est: Quia domus mea, domus orationis vocabitur omnibus gentibus? vos autem fecistis eam speluncam latronum.
18 Quo audito principes sacerdotum et scribæ, quærebant quomodo eum perderent: timebant enim eum, quoniam universa turba admirabatur super doctrina ejus.

19 Et cum vespera facta esset, egrediebatur de civitate.
20 Et cum mane transirent, viderunt ficum aridam factam a radicibus.
21 Et recordatus Petrus, dixit ei: Rabbi, ecce ficus, cui maledixisti, aruit.
22 Et respondens Jesus ait illis: Habete fidem Dei.
23 Amen dico vobis, quia quicumque dixerit huic monti: Tollere, et mittere in mare, et non hæsitaverit in corde suo, sed crediderit, quia quodcumque dixerit fiat, fiet ei.
24 Propterea dico vobis, omnia quæcumque orantes petitis, credite quia accipietis, et evenient vobis.
25 Et cum stabitis ad orandum, dimittite si quis habetis adversus aliquem: ut et Pater vester, qui in cælis est, dimittat vobis peccata vestra.
26 Quod si vos non dimiseritis: nec Pater vester, qui in cælis est, dimittet vobis peccata vestra.

27 Et veniunt rursus Jerosolymam. Et cum ambularet in templo, accedunt ad eum summi sacerdotes, et scribæ, et seniores:
28 et dicunt ei: In qua potestate hæc facis? et quis dedit tibi hanc potestatem ut ista facias?
29 Jesus autem respondens, ait illis: Interrogabo vos et ego unum verbum, et respondete mihi: et dicam vobis in qua potestate hæc faciam.
30 Baptismus Joannis, de cælo erat, an ex hominibus? Respondete mihi.
31 At illi cogitabant secum, dicentes: Si dixerimus: De cælo, dicet: Quare ergo non credidistis ei?
32 Si dixerimus: Ex hominibus, timemus populum: omnes enim habebant Joannem quia vere propheta esset.
33 Et respondentes dicunt Jesu: Nescimus. Et respondens Jesus ait illis: Neque ego dico vobis in qua potestate hæc faciam.


# Κατὰ Μᾶρκον 11 (Textus Receptus)

1 Καὶ ὅτε ἐγγίζουσιν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα εἰς Βηθφαγὴ καὶ Βηθανίαν πρὸς τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαιῶν, ἀποστέλλει δύο τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ
2 καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς: ὑπάγετε εἰς τὴν κώμην τὴν κατέναντι ὑμῶν, καὶ εὐθὺς εἰσπορευόμενοι εἰς αὐτὴν εὑρήσετε πῶλον δεδεμένον, ἐφ' ὃν οὐδεὶς οὔπω ἀνθρώπων ἐκάθισεν: λύσατε αὐτὸν καὶ φέρετε.
3 καὶ ἐάν τις ὑμῖν εἴπῃ: τί ποιεῖτε τοῦτο; εἴπατε: ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει, καὶ εὐθὺς αὐτὸν ἀποστέλλει πάλιν ὧδε.
4 καὶ ἀπῆλθον καὶ εὗρον πῶλον δεδεμένον πρὸς θύραν ἔξω ἐπὶ τοῦ ἀμφόδου, καὶ λύουσιν αὐτόν.
5 καί τινες τῶν ἐκεῖ ἑστηκότων ἔλεγον αὐτοῖς: τί ποιεῖτε λύοντες τὸν πῶλον;
6 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς καθὼς εἶπεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς: καὶ ἀφῆκαν αὐτούς.
7 καὶ φέρουσιν τὸν πῶλον πρὸς τὸν Ἰησοῦν, καὶ ἐπιβάλλουσιν αὐτῷ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐπ' αὐτόν.
8 καὶ πολλοὶ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν ἔστρωσαν εἰς τὴν ὁδόν, ἄλλοι δὲ στιβάδας, κόψαντες ἐκ τῶν ἀγρῶν.
9 καὶ οἱ προάγοντες καὶ οἱ ἀκολουθοῦντες ἔκραζον: ὡσαννά, εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι κυρίου:
10 εὐλογημένη ἡ ἐρχομένη βασιλεία τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν Δαυίδ, ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις.
11 Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα εἰς τὸ ἱερόν: καὶ περιβλεψάμενος πάντα, ὀψίας ἤδη οὔσης τῆς ὥρας, ἐξῆλθεν εἰς Βηθανίαν μετὰ τῶν δώδεκα.

12 Καὶ τῇ ἐπαύριον ἐξελθόντων αὐτῶν ἀπὸ Βηθανίας ἐπείνασεν.
13 καὶ ἰδὼν συκῆν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν ἔχουσαν φύλλα, ἦλθεν εἰ ἄρα τι εὑρήσει ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐλθὼν ἐπ' αὐτὴν οὐδὲν εὗρεν εἰ μὴ φύλλα: ὁ γὰρ καιρὸς οὐκ ἦν σύκων.
14 καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν αὐτῇ: μηκέτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἐκ σοῦ μηδεὶς καρπὸν φάγοι. καὶ ἤκουον οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ.
15 Καὶ ἔρχονται εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα. καὶ εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν ἤρξατο ἐκβάλλειν τοὺς πωλοῦντας καὶ τοὺς ἀγοράζοντας ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ, καὶ τὰς τραπέζας τῶν κολλυβιστῶν καὶ τὰς καθέδρας τῶν πωλούντων τὰς περιστερὰς κατέστρεψεν,
16 καὶ οὐκ ἤφιεν ἵνα τις διενέγκῃ σκεῦος διὰ τοῦ ἱεροῦ,
17 καὶ ἐδίδασκεν καὶ ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς: οὐ γέγραπται ὅτι ὁ οἶκός μου οἶκος προσευχῆς κληθήσεται πᾶσιν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν; ὑμεῖς δὲ πεποιήκατε αὐτὸν σπήλαιον λῃστῶν.
18 καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς, καὶ ἐζήτουν πῶς αὐτὸν ἀπολέσωσιν: ἐφοβοῦντο γὰρ αὐτόν, πᾶς γὰρ ὁ ὄχλος ἐξεπλήσσετο ἐπὶ τῇ διδαχῇ αὐτοῦ.

19 Καὶ ὅταν ὀψὲ ἐγένετο, ἐξεπορεύοντο ἔξω τῆς πόλεως.
20 Καὶ παραπορευόμενοι πρωῒ εἶδον τὴν συκῆν ἐξηραμμένην ἐκ ῥιζῶν.
21 καὶ ἀναμνησθεὶς ὁ Πέτρος λέγει αὐτῷ, ῥαββί, ἴδε ἡ συκῆ ἣν κατηράσω ἐξήρανται.
22 καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς λέγει αὐτοῖς, ἔχετε πίστιν θεοῦ,
23 ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ὃς ἂν εἴπῃ τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ: ἄρθητι καὶ βλήθητι εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ μὴ διακριθῇ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ πιστεύῃ ὅτι ὃ λαλεῖ γίνεται, ἔσται αὐτῷ.
24 διὰ τοῦτο λέγω ὑμῖν, πάντα ὅσα προσεύχεσθε καὶ αἰτεῖσθε, πιστεύετε ὅτι ἐλάβετε, καὶ ἔσται ὑμῖν.
25 καὶ ὅταν στήκετε προσευχόμενοι, ἀφίετε εἴ τι ἔχετε κατά τινος, ἵνα καὶ ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς ἀφῇ ὑμῖν τὰ παραπτώματα ὑμῶν.
26

27 Καὶ ἔρχονται πάλιν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα. καὶ ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ περιπατοῦντος αὐτοῦ ἔρχονται πρὸς αὐτὸν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι
28 καὶ ἔλεγον αὐτῷ: ἐν ποίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ταῦτα ποιεῖς; ἢ τίς σοι ἔδωκεν τὴν ἐξουσίαν ταύτην ἵνα ταῦτα ποιῇς;
29 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: ἐπερωτήσω ὑμᾶς ἕνα λόγον, καὶ ἀποκρίθητέ μοι, καὶ ἐρῶ ὑμῖν ἐν ποίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ταῦτα ποιῶ:
30 τὸ βάπτισμα τὸ Ἰωάννου ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἦν ἢ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων; ἀποκρίθητέ μοι.
31 καὶ διελογίζοντο πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς λέγοντες: ἐὰν εἴπωμεν: ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, ἐρεῖ: διὰ τί οὖν οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε αὐτῷ;
32 ἀλλὰ εἴπωμεν: ἐξ ἀνθρώπων; ἐφοβοῦντο τὸν ὄχλον ἅπαντες γὰρ εἶχον τὸν Ἰωάννην ὄντως ὅτι προφήτης ἦν.
33 καὶ ἀποκριθέντες τῷ Ἰησοῦ λέγουσιν: οὐκ οἴδαμεν. καὶ ὁ Ἰησοῦς λέγει αὐτοῖς: οὐδὲ ἐγὼ λέγω ὑμῖν ἐν ποίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ταῦτα ποιῶ.
