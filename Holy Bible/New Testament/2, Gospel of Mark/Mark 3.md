# Gospel According to Saint Mark 3 (RSVCE)

### The Man with a Withered Hand
1 Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand.
2 And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse him.
3 And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come here.”
4 And he said to them, “Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.
5 And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
6 The Pharisees went out, and immediately held counsel with the Heroʹdi-ans against him, how to destroy him.
### A Multitude at the Seaside
7 Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed; also from Judea
8 and Jerusalem and Idumeʹa and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon a great multitude, hearing all that he did, came to him.
9 And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him;
10 for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.
11 And whenever the unclean spirits beheld him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.”
12 And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.
### Jesus Appoints the Twelve
13 And he went up into the hills, and called to him those whom he desired; and they came to him.
14 And he appointed twelve, to be with him, and to be sent out to preach
15 and have authority to cast out demons:
16 Simon whom he surnamed Peter;
17 James the son of Zebʹedee and John the brother of James, whom he surnamed Bo-anerʹges, that is, sons of thunder;
18 Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,
### Jesus and Beelzebul
19 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Then he went home;
20 and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat.
21 And when his friends heard it, they went out to seize him, for they said, “He is beside himself.”
22 And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Be-elʹzebul, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.”
23 And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?
24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
25 And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
26 And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.
27 But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house.
28 “Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;
29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—
30 for they had said, “He has an unclean spirit.”
### The True Kindred of Jesus
31 And his mother and his brethren came; and standing outside they sent to him and called him.
32 And a crowd was sitting about him; and they said to him, “Your mother and your brethren are outside, asking for you.”
33 And he replied, “Who are my mother and my brethren?”
34 And looking around on those who sat about him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brethren!
35 Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.”


# Evangelium Secundum Marcum 3 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et introivit iterum in synagogam: et erat ibi homo habens manum aridam.
2 Et observabant eum, si sabbatis curaret, ut accusarent illum.
3 Et ait homini habenti manum aridam: Surge in medium.
4 Et dicit eis: Licet sabbatis benefacere, an male? animam salvam facere, an perdere? At illi tacebant.
5 Et circumspiciens eos cum ira, contristatus super cæcitate cordis eorum, dicit homini: Extende manum tuam. Et extendit, et restituta est manus illi.

6 Exeuntes autem pharisæi, statim cum Herodianis consilium faciebant adversus eum quomodo eum perderent.
7 Jesus autem cum discipulis suis secessit ad mare: et multa turba a Galilæa et Judæa secuta est eum,
8 et ab Jerosolymis, et ab Idumæa, et trans Jordanem: et qui circa Tyrum et Sidonem multitudo magna, audientes quæ faciebat, venerunt ad eum.
9 Et dicit discipulis suis ut navicula sibi deserviret propter turbam, ne comprimerent eum:
10 multos enim sanabat, ita ut irruerent in eum ut illum tangerent, quotquot habebant plagas.
11 Et spiritus immundi, cum illum videbant, procidebant ei: et clamabant, dicentes:
12 Tu es Filius Dei. Et vehementer comminabatur eis ne manifestarent illum.

13 Et ascendens in montem vocavit ad se quos voluit ipse: et venerunt ad eum.
14 Et fecit ut essent duodecim cum illo: et ut mitteret eos prædicare.
15 Et dedit illis potestatem curandi infirmitates et ejiciendi dæmonia.
16 Et imposuit Simoni nomen Petrus:
17 et Jacobum Zebedæi, et Joannem fratrem Jacobi, et imposuit eis nomina Boanerges, quod est, Filii tonitrui:
18 et Andræam, et Philippum, et Bartholomæum, et Matthæum, et Thomam, et Jacobum Alphæi, et Thaddæum, et Simonem Cananæum,
19 et Judam Iscariotem, qui et tradidit illum.

20 Et veniunt ad domum: et convenit iterum turba, ita ut non possent neque panem manducare.
21 Et cum audissent sui, exierunt tenere eum: dicebant enim: Quoniam in furorem versus est.
22 Et scribæ, qui ab Jerosolymis descenderant, dicebant: Quoniam Beelzebub habet, et quia in principe dæmoniorum ejicit dæmonia.
23 Et convocatis eis in parabolis dicebat illis: Quomodo potest Satanas Satanam ejicere?
24 Et si regnum in se dividatur, non potest regnum illud stare.
25 Et si domus super semetipsam dispertiatur, non potest domus illa stare.
26 Et si Satanas consurrexerit in semetipsum, dispertitus est, et non poterit stare, sed finem habet.
27 Nemo potest vasa fortis ingressus in domum diripere, nisi prius fortem alliget, et tunc domum ejus diripiet.
28 Amen dico vobis, quoniam omnia dimittentur filiis hominum peccata, et blasphemiæ quibus blasphemaverint:
29 qui autem blasphemaverit in Spiritum Sanctum, non habebit remissionem in æternum, sed reus erit æterni delicti.
30 Quoniam dicebant: Spiritum immundum habet.

31 Et veniunt mater ejus et fratres: et foris stantes miserunt ad eum vocantes eum,
32 et sedebat circa eum turba: et dicunt ei: Ecce mater tua et fratres tui foris quærunt te.
33 Et respondens eis, ait: Quæ est mater mea et fratres mei?
34 Et circumspiciens eos, qui in circuitu ejus sedebant, ait: Ecce mater mea et fratres mei.
35 Qui enim fecerit voluntatem Dei, hic frater meus, et soror mea, et mater est.


# Κατὰ Μᾶρκον 3 (Textus Receptus)

1 Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πάλιν εἰς τὴν συναγωγήν, καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος ἐξηραμμένην ἔχων τὴν χεῖρα:
2 καὶ παρετήρουν αὐτὸν εἰ τοῖς σάββασιν θεραπεύσει αὐτόν, ἵνα κατηγορήσωσιν αὐτοῦ.
3 καὶ λέγει τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τῷ τὴν ξηρὰν χεῖρα ἔχοντι: ἔγειρε εἰς τὸ μέσον.
4 καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς: ἔξεστιν τοῖς σάββασιν ἀγαθὸν ποιῆσαι ἢ κακοποιῆσαι, ψυχὴν σῶσαι ἢ ἀποκτεῖναι; οἱ δὲ ἐσιώπων.
5 καὶ περιβλεψάμενος αὐτοὺς μετ' ὀργῆς, συλλυπούμενος ἐπὶ τῇ πωρώσει τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν, λέγει τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ: ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρα. καὶ ἐξέτεινεν, καὶ ἀπεκατεστάθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ.

6 καὶ ἐξελθόντες οἱ Φαρισαῖοι εὐθὺς μετὰ τῶν Ἡρῳδιανῶν συμβούλιον ἐδίδουν κατ' αὐτοῦ ὅπως αὐτὸν ἀπολέσωσιν.
7 Καὶ ὁ Ἰησοῦς μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ ἀνεχώρησεν πρὸς τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ πολὺ πλῆθος ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ἠκολούθησεν καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰουδαίας
8 καὶ ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰδουμαίας καὶ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου καὶ περὶ Τύρον καὶ Σιδῶνα, πλῆθος πολύ, ἀκούοντες ὅσα ἐποίει ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτόν.
9 καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς μαθηταῖς αὐτοῦ ἵνα πλοιάριον προσκαρτερῇ αὐτῷ διὰ τὸν ὄχλον, ἵνα μὴ θλίβωσιν αὐτόν:
10 πολλοὺς γὰρ ἐθεράπευσεν, ὥστε ἐπιπίπτειν αὐτῷ, ἵνα αὐτοῦ ἅψωνται, ὅσοι εἶχον μάστιγας.
11 καὶ τὰ πνεύματα τὰ ἀκάθαρτα, ὅταν αὐτὸν ἐθεώρουν, προσέπιπτον αὐτῷ καὶ ἔκραζον λέγοντες ὅτι σὺ εἶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ.
12 καὶ πολλὰ ἐπετίμα αὐτοῖς ἵνα μὴ αὐτὸν φανερὸν ποιήσωσιν.

13 Καὶ ἀναβαίνει εἰς τὸ ὄρος καὶ προσκαλεῖται οὓς ἤθελεν αὐτός, καὶ ἀπῆλθον πρὸς αὐτόν.
14 καὶ ἐποίησεν δώδεκα, οὓς καὶ ἀποστόλους ὠνόμασεν ἵνα ὦσιν μετ' αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἵνα ἀποστέλλῃ αὐτοὺς κηρύσσειν
15 καὶ ἔχειν ἐξουσίαν ἐκβάλλειν τὰ δαιμόνια:
16 καὶ ἐποίησεν τοὺς δώδεκα, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ὄνομα τῷ Σίμωνι Πέτρον:
17 καὶ Ἰάκωβον τὸν τοῦ Ζεβεδαίου καὶ Ἰωάννην τὸν ἀδελφὸν τοῦ Ἰακώβου, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν αὐτοῖς ὀνόματα Βοανηργές, ὅ ἐστιν υἱοὶ βροντῆς:
18 καὶ Ἀνδρέαν καὶ Φίλιππον καὶ Βαρθολομαῖον καὶ Μαθθαῖον καὶ Θωμᾶν καὶ Ἰάκωβον τὸν τοῦ Ἁλφαίου καὶ Θαδδαῖον καὶ Σίμωνα τὸν Καναναῖον
19 καὶ Ἰούδαν Ἰσκαριώθ, ὃς καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτόν.

20 Καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς οἶκον: καὶ συνέρχεται πάλιν ὁ ὄχλος, ὥστε μὴ δύνασθαι αὐτοὺς μηδὲ ἄρτον φαγεῖν.
21 καὶ ἀκούσαντες οἱ παρ' αὐτοῦ ἐξῆλθον κρατῆσαι αὐτόν: ἔλεγον γὰρ ὅτι ἐξέστη.
22 καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς οἱ ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων καταβάντες ἔλεγον ὅτι Βεελζεβοὺλ ἔχει, καὶ ὅτι ἐν τῷ ἄρχοντι τῶν δαιμονίων ἐκβάλλει τὰ δαιμόνια.
23 καὶ προσκαλεσάμενος αὐτοὺς ἐν παραβολαῖς ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς: πῶς δύναται Σατανᾶς Σατανᾶν ἐκβάλλειν;
24 καὶ ἐὰν βασιλεία ἐφ' ἑαυτὴν μερισθῇ, οὐ δύναται σταθῆναι ἡ βασιλεία ἐκείνη.
25 καὶ ἐὰν οἰκία ἐφ' ἑαυτὴν μερισθῇ, οὐ δυνήσεται ἡ οἰκία ἐκείνη σταθῆναι.
26 καὶ εἰ ὁ Σατανᾶς ἀνέστη ἐφ' ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἐμερίσθη οὐ δύναται στῆναι ἀλλὰ τέλος ἔχει.
27 ἀλλ' οὐ δύναται οὐδεὶς εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ εἰσελθὼν τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ διαρπάσαι, ἐὰν μὴ πρῶτον τὸν ἰσχυρὸν δήσῃ, καὶ τότε τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ διαρπάσει.
28 ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι πάντα ἀφεθήσεται τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων τὰ ἁμαρτήματα καὶ αἱ βλασφημίαι, ὅσα ἐὰν βλασφημήσωσιν:
29 ὃς δ' ἂν βλασφημήσῃ εἰς τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον, οὐκ ἔχει ἄφεσιν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, ἀλλὰ ἔνοχός ἐστιν αἰωνίου ἁμαρτήματος
30 ὅτι ἔλεγον: πνεῦμα ἀκάθαρτον ἔχει.

31 Καὶ ἔρχεται ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔξω στήκοντες ἀπέστειλαν πρὸς αὐτὸν καλοῦντες αὐτόν.
32 καὶ ἐκάθητο περὶ αὐτὸν ὄχλος, καὶ λέγουσιν αὐτῷ: ἰδοὺ ἡ μήτηρ σου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου καὶ αἱ ἀδελφαί σου ἔξω ζητοῦσίν σε.
33 καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτοῖς λέγει: τίς ἐστιν ἡ μήτηρ μου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου;
34 καὶ περιβλεψάμενος τοὺς περὶ αὐτὸν κύκλῳ καθημένους λέγει: ἴδε ἡ μήτηρ μου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου.
35 ὃς γὰρ ἂν ποιήσῃ τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ, οὗτος ἀδελφός μου καὶ ἀδελφὴ καὶ μήτηρ ἐστίν.
