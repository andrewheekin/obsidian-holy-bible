# Gospel According to Saint Mark 10 (RSVCE)

### Teaching about Divorce
1 And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gathered to him again; and again, as his custom was, he taught them.
2 And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”
3 He answered them, “What did Moses command you?”
4 They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away.”
5 But Jesus said to them, “For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.
6 But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’
7 ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,
8 and the two shall become one.’ So they are no longer two but one.
9 What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.”
10 And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.
11 And he said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery against her;
12 and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”
### Jesus Blesses Little Children
13 And they were bringing children to him, that he might touch them; and the disciples rebuked them.
14 But when Jesus saw it he was indignant, and said to them, “Let the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God.
15 Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”
16 And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands upon them.
### The Rich Man
17 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
18 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.
19 You know the commandments: ‘Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’ ”
20 And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.”
21 And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing; go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”
22 At that saying his countenance fell, and he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.
23 And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it will be for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!”
24 And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God!
25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
26 And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, “Then who can be saved?”
27 Jesus looked at them and said, “With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.”
28 Peter began to say to him, “Lo, we have left everything and followed you.”
29 Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,
30 who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life.
31 But many that are first will be last, and the last first.”
### A Third Time Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection
32 And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him,
33 saying, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles;
34 and they will mock him, and spit upon him, and scourge him, and kill him; and after three days he will rise.”
### The Request of James and John
35 And James and John, the sons of Zebʹedee, came forward to him, and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.”
36 And he said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”
37 And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.”
38 But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”
39 And they said to him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized;
40 but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”
41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John.
42 And Jesus called them to him and said to them, “You know that those who are supposed to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.
43 But it shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant,
44 and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all.
45 For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
### The Healing of Blind Bartimaeus
46 And they came to Jericho; and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, Bartimaeʹus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeʹus, was sitting by the roadside.
47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
48 And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent; but he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
49 And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart; rise, he is calling you.”
50 And throwing off his mantle he sprang up and came to Jesus.
51 And Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Master, let me receive my sight.”
52 And Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” And immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way.


# Evangelium Secundum Marcum 10 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et inde exsurgens venit in fines Judææ ultra Jordanem: et conveniunt iterum turbæ ad eum: et sicut consueverat, iterum docebat illos.
2 Et accedentes pharisæi interrogabant eum: Si licet viro uxorem dimittere: tentantes eum.
3 At ille respondens, dixit eis: Quid vobis præcepit Moyses?
4 Qui dixerunt: Moyses permisit libellum repudii scribere, et dimittere.
5 Quibus respondens Jesus, ait: Ad duritiam cordis vestri scripsit vobis præceptum istud:
6 ab initio autem creaturæ masculum et feminam fecit eos Deus.
7 Propter hoc relinquet homo patrem suum et matrem, et adhærebit ad uxorem suam:
8 et erunt duo in carne una. Itaque jam non sunt duo, sed una caro.
9 Quod ergo Deus conjunxit, homo non separet.
10 Et in domo iterum discipuli ejus de eodem interrogaverunt eum.
11 Et ait illis: Quicumque dimiserit uxorem suam, et aliam duxerit, adulterium committit super eam.
12 Et si uxor dimiserit virum suum, et alii nupserit, mœchatur.

13 Et offerebant illi parvulos ut tangeret illos. Discipuli autem comminabantur offerentibus.
14 Quos cum videret Jesus, indigne tulit, et ait illis: Sinite parvulos venire ad me, et ne prohibueritis eos: talium enim est regnum Dei.
15 Amen dico vobis: Quisquis non receperit regnum Dei velut parvulus, non intrabit in illud.
16 Et complexans eos, et imponens manus super illos, benedicebat eos.

17 Et cum egressus esset in viam, procurrens quidam genu flexo ante eum, rogabat eum: Magister bone, quid faciam ut vitam æternam percipiam?
18 Jesus autem dixit ei: Quid me dicis bonum? nemo bonus, nisi unus Deus.
19 Præcepta nosti: ne adulteres, ne occidas, ne fureris, ne falsum testimonium dixeris, ne fraudum feceris, honora patrem tuum et matrem.
20 At ille respondens, ait illi: Magister, hæc omnia observavi a juventute mea.
21 Jesus autem intuitus eum, dilexit eum, et dixit ei: Unum tibi deest: vade, quæcumque habes vende, et da pauperibus, et habebis thesaurum in cælo: et veni, sequere me.
22 Qui contristatus in verbo, abiit mœrens: erat enim habens multas possessiones.
23 Et circumspiciens Jesus, ait discipulis suis: Quam difficile qui pecunias habent, in regnum Dei introibunt!
24 Discipuli autem obstupescebant in verbis ejus. At Jesus rursus respondens ait illis: Filioli, quam difficile est, confidentes in pecuniis, in regnum Dei introire!
25 Facilius est camelum per foramen acus transire, quam divitem intrare in regnum Dei.
26 Qui magis admirabantur, dicentes ad semetipsos: Et quis potest salvus fieri?
27 Et intuens illos Jesus, ait: Apud homines impossibile est, sed non apud Deum: omnia enim possibilia sunt apud Deum.

28 Et cœpit ei Petrus dicere: Ecce nos dimisimus omnia, et secuti sumus te.
29 Respondens Jesus, ait: Amen dico vobis: Nemo est qui reliquerit domum, aut fratres, aut sorores, aut patrem, aut matrem, aut filios, aut agros propter me et propter Evangelium,
30 qui non accipiat centies tantum, nunc in tempore hoc: domos, et fratres, et sorores, et matres, et filios, et agros, cum persecutionibus, et in sæculo futuro vitam æternam.
31 Multi autem erunt primi novissimi, et novissimi primi.

32 Erant autem in via ascendentes Jerosolymam: et præcedebat illos Jesus, et stupebant: et sequentes timebant. Et assumens iterum duodecim, cœpit illis dicere quæ essent ei eventura.
33 Quia ecce ascendimus Jerosolymam, et Filius hominis tradetur principibus sacerdotum, et scribis, et senioribus, et damnabunt eum morte, et tradent eum gentibus:
34 et illudent ei, et conspuent eum, et flagellabunt eum, et interficient eum: et tertia die resurget.

35 Et accedunt ad eum Jacobus et Joannes filii Zebedæi, dicentes: Magister, volumus ut quodcumque petierimus, facias nobis.
36 At ille dixit eis: Quid vultis ut faciam vobis?
37 Et dixerunt: Da nobis ut unus ad dexteram tuam, et alius ad sinistram tuam sedeamus in gloria tua.
38 Jesus autem ait eis: Nescitis quid petatis: potestis bibere calicem, quem ego bibo, aut baptismo, quo ego baptizor, baptizari?
39 At illi dixerunt ei: Possumus. Jesus autem ait eis: Calicem quidem, quem ego bibo, bibetis; et baptismo, quo ego baptizor, baptizabimini:
40 sedere autem ad dexteram meam, vel ad sinistram, non est meum dare vobis, sed quibus paratum est.

41 Et audientes decem, cœperunt indignari de Jacobo et Joanne.
42 Jesus autem vocans eos, ait illis: Scitis quia hi, qui videntur principari gentibus, dominantur eis: et principes eorum potestatem habent ipsorum.
43 Non ita est autem in vobis, sed quicumque voluerit fieri major, erit vester minister:
44 et quicumque voluerit in vobis primus esse, erit omnium servus.
45 Nam et Filius hominis non venit ut ministraretur ei, sed ut ministraret, et daret animam suam redemptionem pro multis.

46 Et veniunt Jericho: et proficiscente eo de Jericho, et discipulis ejus, et plurima multitudine, filius Timæi Bartimæus cæcus, sedebat juxta viam mendicans.
47 Qui cum audisset quia Jesus Nazarenus est, cœpit clamare, et dicere: Jesu fili David, miserere mei.
48 Et comminabantur ei multi ut taceret. At ille multo magis clamabat: Fili David, miserere mei.
49 Et stans Jesus præcepit illum vocari. Et vocant cæcum, dicentes ei: Animæquior esto: surge, vocat te.
50 Qui projecto vestimento suo exiliens, venit ad eum.
51 Et respondens Jesus dixit illi: Quid tibi vis faciam? Cæcus autem dixit ei: Rabboni, ut videam.
52 Jesus autem ait illi: Vade, fides tua te salvum fecit. Et confestim vidit, et sequebatur eum in via.


# Κατὰ Μᾶρκον 10 (Textus Receptus)

1 Καὶ ἐκεῖθεν ἀναστὰς ἔρχεται εἰς τὰ ὅρια τῆς Ἰουδαίας καὶ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, καὶ συμπορεύονται πάλιν ὄχλοι πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ὡς εἰώθει πάλιν ἐδίδασκεν αὐτούς.
2 καὶ προσελθόντες Φαρισαῖοι ἐπηρώτων αὐτὸν εἰ ἔξεστιν ἀνδρὶ γυναῖκα ἀπολῦσαι, πειράζοντες αὐτόν.
3 ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: τί ὑμῖν ἐνετείλατο Μωϋσῆς;
4 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν: ἐπέτρεψεν Μωϋσῆς βιβλίον ἀποστασίου γράψαι καὶ ἀπολῦσαι.
5 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: πρὸς τὴν σκληροκαρδίαν ὑμῶν ἔγραψεν ὑμῖν τὴν ἐντολὴν ταύτην.
6 ἀπὸ δὲ ἀρχῆς κτίσεως ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ ἐποίησεν αὐτούς:
7 ἕνεκεν τούτου καταλείψει ἄνθρωπος τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα καὶ προσκολληθήσεται πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ,
8 καὶ ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν, ὥστε οὐκέτι εἰσὶν δύο ἀλλὰ μία σάρξ.
9 ὃ οὖν ὁ θεὸς συνέζευξεν, ἄνθρωπος μὴ χωριζέτω.
10 καὶ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν πάλιν οἱ μαθηταὶ περὶ τούτου ἐπηρώτων αὐτόν.
11 καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς: ὃς ἂν ἀπολύσῃ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ γαμήσῃ ἄλλην, μοιχᾶται ἐπ' αὐτήν:
12 καὶ ἐὰν αὐτὴ ἀπολύσασα τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς γαμήσῃ ἄλλον, μοιχᾶται.

13 Καὶ προσέφερον αὐτῷ παιδία ἵνα αὐτῶν ἅψηται οἱ δὲ μαθηταὶ ἐπετίμησαν αὐτοῖς
14 ἰδὼν δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἠγανάκτησεν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: ἄφετε τὰ παιδία ἔρχεσθαι πρός με, μὴ κωλύετε αὐτά: τῶν γὰρ τοιούτων ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ.
15 ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, ὃς ἂν μὴ δέξηται τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ ὡς παιδίον, οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς αὐτήν.
16 καὶ ἐναγκαλισάμενος αὐτὰ κατευλόγει τιθεὶς τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ' αὐτά.

17 Καὶ ἐκπορευομένου αὐτοῦ εἰς ὁδὸν προσδραμὼν εἷς καὶ γονυπετήσας αὐτὸν ἐπηρώτα αὐτόν: διδάσκαλε ἀγαθέ, τί ποιήσω ἵνα ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω;
18 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ: τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν; οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ θεός.
19 τὰς ἐντολὰς οἶδας: μὴ φονεύσῃς μὴ μοιχεύσῃς μὴ κλέψῃς, μὴ ψευδομαρτυρήσῃς, μὴ ἀποστερήσῃς, τίμα τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα.
20 ὁ δὲ ἔφη αὐτῷ: διδάσκαλε, ταῦτα πάντα ἐφυλαξάμην ἐκ νεότητός μου.
21 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς ἐμβλέψας αὐτῷ ἠγάπησεν αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ: ἕν σε ὑστερεῖ: ὕπαγε, ὅσα ἔχεις πώλησον καὶ δὸς τοῖς πτωχοῖς, καὶ ἕξεις θησαυρὸν ἐν οὐρανῷ, καὶ δεῦρο ἀκολούθει μοι.
22 ὁ δὲ στυγνάσας ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ ἀπῆλθεν λυπούμενος: ἦν γὰρ ἔχων κτήματα πολλά.
23 καὶ περιβλεψάμενος ὁ Ἰησοῦς λέγει τοῖς μαθηταῖς αὐτοῦ: πῶς δυσκόλως οἱ τὰ χρήματα ἔχοντες εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ εἰσελεύσονται.
24 οἱ δὲ μαθηταὶ ἐθαμβοῦντο ἐπὶ τοῖς λόγοις αὐτοῦ. ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς πάλιν ἀποκριθεὶς λέγει αὐτοῖς: τέκνα, πῶς δύσκολόν ἐστιν εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ εἰσελθεῖν:
25 εὐκοπώτερόν ἐστιν κάμηλον διὰ τῆς τρυμαλιᾶς τῆς ῥαφίδος διελθεῖν ἢ πλούσιον εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ εἰσελθεῖν.
26 οἱ δὲ περισσῶς ἐξεπλήσσοντο λέγοντες πρὸς ἑαυτούς, καὶ τίς δύναται σωθῆναι;
27 ἐμβλέψας αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς λέγει: παρὰ ἀνθρώποις ἀδύνατον, ἀλλ' οὐ παρὰ θεῷ: πάντα γὰρ δυνατὰ παρὰ τῷ θεῷ.

28 Ἤρξατο λέγειν ὁ Πέτρος αὐτῷ: ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς ἀφήκαμεν πάντα καὶ ἠκολουθήκαμέν σοι.
29 ἔφη ὁ Ἰησοῦς, ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, οὐδείς ἐστιν ὃς ἀφῆκεν οἰκίαν ἢ ἀδελφοὺς ἢ ἀδελφὰς ἢ μητέρα ἢ πατέρα ἢ τέκνα ἢ ἀγροὺς ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ καὶ ἕνεκεν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου,
30 ἐὰν μὴ λάβῃ ἑκατονταπλασίονα νῦν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ οἰκίας καὶ ἀδελφοὺς καὶ ἀδελφὰς καὶ μητέρας καὶ τέκνα καὶ ἀγροὺς μετὰ διωγμῶν, καὶ ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τῷ ἐρχομένῳ ζωὴν αἰώνιον.
31 πολλοὶ δὲ ἔσονται πρῶτοι ἔσχατοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι πρῶτοι.

32 Ἦσαν δὲ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἀναβαίνοντες εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, καὶ ἦν προάγων αὐτοὺς ὁ Ἰησοῦς, καὶ ἐθαμβοῦντο, οἱ δὲ ἀκολουθοῦντες ἐφοβοῦντο. καὶ παραλαβὼν πάλιν τοὺς δώδεκα ἤρξατο αὐτοῖς λέγειν τὰ μέλλοντα αὐτῷ συμβαίνειν,
33 ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἀναβαίνομεν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου παραδοθήσεται τοῖς ἀρχιερεῦσιν καὶ τοῖς γραμματεῦσιν, καὶ κατακρινοῦσιν αὐτὸν θανάτῳ καὶ παραδώσουσιν αὐτὸν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν
34 καὶ ἐμπαίξουσιν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐμπτύσουσιν αὐτῷ καὶ μαστιγώσουσιν αὐτὸν καὶ ἀποκτενοῦσιν, καὶ μετὰ τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἀναστήσεται.

35 Καὶ προσπορεύονται αὐτῷ Ἰάκωβος καὶ Ἰωάννης οἱ υἱοὶ Ζεβεδαίου, λέγοντες αὐτῷ, διδάσκαλε, θέλομεν ἵνα ὃ ἐὰν αἰτήσωμέν σε ποιήσῃς ἡμῖν.
36 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: τί θέλετέ με ποιήσω ὑμῖν;
37 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν αὐτῷ, δὸς ἡμῖν ἵνα εἷς σου ἐκ δεξιῶν καὶ εἷς ἐξ ἀριστερῶν καθίσωμεν ἐν τῇ δόξῃ σου.
38 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: οὐκ οἴδατε τί αἰτεῖσθε. δύνασθε πιεῖν τὸ ποτήριον ὃ ἐγὼ πίνω, ἢ τὸ βάπτισμα ὃ ἐγὼ βαπτίζομαι βαπτισθῆναι;
39 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν αὐτῷ: δυνάμεθα. ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: τὸ ποτήριον ὃ ἐγὼ πίνω πίεσθε καὶ τὸ βάπτισμα ὃ ἐγὼ βαπτίζομαι βαπτισθήσεσθε:
40 τὸ δὲ καθίσαι ἐκ δεξιῶν μου ἢ ἐξ εὐωνύμων οὐκ ἔστιν ἐμὸν δοῦναι, ἀλλ' οἷς ἡτοίμασται.

41 Καὶ ἀκούσαντες οἱ δέκα ἤρξαντο ἀγανακτεῖν περὶ Ἰακώβου καὶ Ἰωάννου.
42 καὶ προσκαλεσάμενος αὐτοὺς ὁ Ἰησοῦς λέγει αὐτοῖς: οἴδατε ὅτι οἱ δοκοῦντες ἄρχειν τῶν ἐθνῶν κατακυριεύουσιν αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ μεγάλοι αὐτῶν κατεξουσιάζουσιν αὐτῶν.
43 οὐχ οὕτως δέ ἐστιν ἐν ὑμῖν: ἀλλ' ὃς ἂν θέλῃ μέγας γενέσθαι ἐν ὑμῖν, ἔσται ὑμῶν διάκονος,
44 καὶ ὃς ἂν θέλῃ ἐν ὑμῖν εἶναι πρῶτος, ἔσται πάντων δοῦλος:
45 καὶ γὰρ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου οὐκ ἦλθεν διακονηθῆναι ἀλλὰ διακονῆσαι καὶ δοῦναι τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ λύτρον ἀντὶ πολλῶν.

46 Καὶ ἔρχονται εἰς Ἰεριχώ. καὶ ἐκπορευομένου αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ Ἰεριχὼ καὶ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ὄχλου ἱκανοῦ ὁ υἱὸς Τιμαίου Βαρτιμαῖος, τυφλὸς προσαίτης, ἐκάθητο παρὰ τὴν ὁδόν.
47 καὶ ἀκούσας ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ὁ Ναζαρηνός ἐστιν, ἤρξατο κράζειν καὶ λέγειν: υἱὲ Δαυὶδ Ἰησοῦ, ἐλέησόν με.
48 καὶ ἐπετίμων αὐτῷ πολλοὶ ἵνα σιωπήσῃ: ὁ δὲ πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἔκραζεν, υἱὲ Δαυίδ, ἐλέησόν με.
49 καὶ στὰς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν: φωνήσατε αὐτόν. καὶ φωνοῦσιν τὸν τυφλὸν λέγοντες αὐτῷ: θάρσει, ἔγειρε, φωνεῖ σε.
50 ὁ δὲ ἀποβαλὼν τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ ἀναπηδήσας ἦλθεν πρὸς τὸν Ἰησοῦν.
51 καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν: τί σοι θέλεις ποιήσω; ὁ δὲ τυφλὸς εἶπεν αὐτῷ: ραββουνι ἵνα ἀναβλέψω.
52 καὶ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ, ὕπαγε, ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε. καὶ εὐθὺς ἀνέβλεψεν, καὶ ἠκολούθει αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ.
