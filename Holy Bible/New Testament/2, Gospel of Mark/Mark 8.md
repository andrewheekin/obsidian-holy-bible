# Gospel According to Saint Mark 8 (RSVCE)

### Feeding the Four Thousand
1 In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him, and said to them,
2 “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat;
3 and if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long way.”
4 And his disciples answered him, “How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert?”
5 And he asked them, “How many loaves have you?” They said, “Seven.”
6 And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd.
7 And they had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also should be set before them.
8 And they ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.
9 And there were about four thousand people.
10 And he sent them away; and immediately he got into the boat with his disciples, and went to the district of Dalmanuʹtha.
### The Demand for a Sign
11 The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, to test him.
12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.”
13 And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side.
### The Yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod
14 Now they had forgotten to bring bread; and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
15 And he cautioned them, saying, “Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”
16 And they discussed it with one another, saying, “We have no bread.”
17 And being aware of it, Jesus said to them, “Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
18 Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?
19 When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They said to him, “Twelve.”
20 “And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” And they said to him, “Seven.”
21 And he said to them, “Do you not yet understand?”
### Jesus Cures a Blind Man at Bethsaida
22 And they came to Beth-saʹida. And some people brought to him a blind man, and begged him to touch him.
23 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, “Do you see anything?”
24 And he looked up and said, “I see men; but they look like trees, walking.”
25 Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and saw everything clearly.
26 And he sent him away to his home, saying, “Do not even enter the village.”
### Peter’s Declaration about Jesus
27 And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of Caesareʹa Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do men say that I am?”
28 And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Eliʹjah; and others one of the prophets.”
29 And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.”
30 And he charged them to tell no one about him.
### Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection
31 And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
32 And he said this plainly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
33 But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter, and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are not on the side of God, but of men.”
34 And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
35 For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it.
36 For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?
37 For what can a man give in return for his life?
38 For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of man also be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”


# Evangelium Secundum Marcum 8 (Latin Vulgate)

1 In diebus illis iterum cum turba multa esset, nec haberent quod manducarent, convocatis discipulis, ait illis:
2 Misereor super turbam: quia ecce jam triduo sustinent me, nec habent quod manducent:
3 et si dimisero eos jejunos in domum suam, deficient in via: quidam enim ex eis de longe venerunt.
4 Et responderunt ei discipuli sui: Unde illos quis poterit saturare panibus in solitudine?
5 Et interrogavit eos: Quot panes habetis? Qui dixerunt: Septem.
6 Et præcepit turbæ discumbere super terram. Et accipiens septem panes, gratias agens fregit, et dabat discipulis suis ut apponerent, et apposuerunt turbæ.
7 Et habebant pisciculos paucos: et ipsos benedixit, et jussit apponi.
8 Et manducaverunt, et saturati sunt, et sustulerunt quod superaverat de fragmentis, septem sportas.
9 Erant autem qui manducaverunt, quasi quatuor millia: et dimisit eos.

10 Et statim ascendens navim cum discipulis suis, venit in partes Dalmanutha.
11 Et exierunt pharisæi, et cœperunt conquirere cum eo, quærentes ab illo signum de cælo, tentantes eum.
12 Et ingemiscens spiritu, ait: Quid generatio ista signum quærit? Amen dico vobis, si dabitur generationi isti signum.
13 Et dimittens eos, ascendit iterum navim et abiit trans fretum.

14 Et obliti sunt panes sumere: et nisi unum panem non habebant secum in navi.
15 Et præcipiebat eis, dicens: Videte, et cavete a fermento pharisæorum, et fermento Herodis.
16 Et cogitabant ad alterutrum, dicentes: quia panes non habemus.
17 Quo cognito, ait illis Jesus: Quid cogitatis, quia panes non habetis? nondum cognoscetis nec intelligitis? adhuc cæcatum habetis cor vestrum?
18 oculos habentes non videtis? et aures habentes non auditis? nec recordamini,
19 quando quinque panes fregi in quinque millia: quot cophinos fragmentorum plenos sustulistis? Dicunt ei: Duodecim.
20 Quando et septem panes in quatuor millia: quot sportas fragmentorum tulistis? Et dicunt ei: Septem.
21 Et dicebat eis: Quomodo nondum intelligitis?

22 Et veniunt Bethsaidam, et adducunt ei cæcum, et rogabant eum ut illum tangeret.
23 Et apprehensa manu cæci, eduxit eum extra vicum: et exspuens in oculos ejus impositis manibus suis, interrogavit eum si quid videret.
24 Et aspiciens, ait: Video homines velut arbores ambulantes.
25 Deinde iterum imposuit manus super oculos ejus: et cœpit videre: et restitutus est ita ut clare videret omnia.
26 Et misit illum in domum suam, dicens: Vade in domum tuam: et si in vicum introieris, nemini dixeris.

27 Et egressus est Jesus, et discipuli ejus in castella Cæsareæ Philippi: et in via interrogabat discipulos suos, dicens eis: Quem me dicunt esse homines?
28 Qui responderunt illi, dicentes: Joannem Baptistam, alii Eliam, alii vero quasi unum de prophetis.
29 Tunc dicit illis: Vos vero quem me esse dicitis? Respondens Petrus, ait ei: Tu es Christus.
30 Et comminatus est eis, ne cui dicerent de illo.
31 Et cœpit docere eos quoniam oportet Filium hominis pati multa, et reprobari a senioribus, et a summis sacerdotibus et scribis, et occidi: et post tres dies resurgere.
32 Et palam verbum loquebatur. Et apprehendens eum Petrus, cœpit increpare eum.
33 Qui conversus, et videns discipulos suos, comminatus est Petro, dicens: Vade retro me Satana, quoniam non sapis quæ Dei sunt, sed quæ sunt hominum.
34 Et convocata turba cum discipulis suis, dixit eis: Si quis vult me sequi, deneget semetipsum: et tollat crucem suam, et sequatur me.
35 Qui enim voluerit animam suam salvam facere, perdet eam: qui autem perdiderit animam suam propter me, et Evangelium, salvam faciet eam.
36 Quid enim proderit homini, si lucretur mundum totum et detrimentum animæ suæ faciat?
37 Aut quid dabit homo commutationis pro anima sua?
38 Qui enim me confusus fuerit, et verba mea in generatione ista adultera et peccatrice, et Filius hominis confundetur eum, cum venerit in gloria Patris sui cum angelis sanctis.
39 Et dicebat illis: Amen dico vobis, quia sunt quidam de hic stantibus, qui non gustabunt mortem donec videant regnum Dei veniens in virtute.


# Κατὰ Μᾶρκον 8 (Textus Receptus)

1 Ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις πάλιν πολλοῦ ὄχλου ὄντος καὶ μὴ ἐχόντων τί φάγωσιν, προσκαλεσάμενος τοὺς μαθητὰς λέγει αὐτοῖς:
2 σπλαγχνίζομαι ἐπὶ τὸν ὄχλον, ὅτι ἤδη ἡμέραι τρεῖς προσμένουσίν μοι καὶ οὐκ ἔχουσιν τί φάγωσιν.
3 καὶ ἐὰν ἀπολύσω αὐτοὺς νήστεις εἰς οἶκον αὐτῶν, ἐκλυθήσονται ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ: καί τινες αὐτῶν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν ἥκασιν.
4 καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ ὅτι πόθεν τούτους δυνήσεταί τις ὧδε χορτάσαι ἄρτων ἐπ' ἐρημίας;
5 καὶ ἠρώτα αὐτούς: πόσους ἔχετε ἄρτους; οἱ δὲ εἶπαν: ἑπτά.
6 καὶ παραγγέλλει τῷ ὄχλῳ ἀναπεσεῖν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς: καὶ λαβὼν τοὺς ἑπτὰ ἄρτους εὐχαριστήσας ἔκλασεν καὶ ἐδίδου τοῖς μαθηταῖς αὐτοῦ ἵνα παρατιθῶσιν: καὶ παρέθηκαν τῷ ὄχλῳ.
7 καὶ εἶχον ἰχθύδια ὀλίγα: καὶ εὐλογήσας αὐτὰ εἶπεν καὶ ταῦτα παρατιθέναι.
8 καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἐχορτάσθησαν, καὶ ἦραν περισσεύματα κλασμάτων ἑπτὰ σπυρίδας.
9 ἦσαν δὲ ὡς τετρακισχίλιοι: καὶ ἀπέλυσεν αὐτούς.

10 Καὶ εὐθὺς ἐμβὰς εἰς τὸ πλοῖον μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ ἦλθεν εἰς τὰ μέρη Δαλμανουθά.
11 καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ Φαρισαῖοι καὶ ἤρξαντο συζητεῖν αὐτῷ, ζητοῦντες παρ' αὐτοῦ σημεῖον ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, πειράζοντες αὐτόν.
12 καὶ ἀναστενάξας τῷ πνεύματι αὐτοῦ λέγει: τί ἡ γενεὰ αὕτη ζητεῖ σημεῖον; ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν εἰ δοθήσεται τῇ γενεᾷ ταύτῃ σημεῖον.
13 καὶ ἀφεὶς αὐτοὺς πάλιν ἐμβὰς ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὸ πέραν.

14 Καὶ ἐπελάθοντο λαβεῖν ἄρτους, καὶ εἰ μὴ ἕνα ἄρτον οὐκ εἶχον μεθ' ἑαυτῶν ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ.
15 καὶ διεστέλλετο αὐτοῖς λέγων: ὁρᾶτε, βλέπετε ἀπὸ τῆς ζύμης τῶν Φαρισαίων καὶ τῆς ζύμης Ἡρῴδου.
16 καὶ διελογίζοντο πρὸς ἀλλήλους ὅτι ἄρτους οὐκ ἔχουσιν.
17 καὶ γνοὺς λέγει αὐτοῖς: τί διαλογίζεσθε ὅτι ἄρτους οὐκ ἔχετε; οὔπω νοεῖτε οὐδὲ συνίετε; πεπωρωμένην ἔχετε τὴν καρδίαν ὑμῶν;
18 ὀφθαλμοὺς ἔχοντες οὐ βλέπετε, καὶ ὦτα ἔχοντες οὐκ ἀκούετε, καὶ οὐ μνημονεύετε,
19 ὅτε τοὺς πέντε ἄρτους ἔκλασα εἰς τοὺς πεντακισχιλίους, πόσους κοφίνους κλασμάτων πλήρεις ἤρατε; λέγουσιν αὐτῷ: δώδεκα.
20 ὅτε τοὺς ἑπτὰ εἰς τοὺς τετρακισχιλίους πόσων σπυρίδων πληρώματα κλασμάτων ἤρατε καὶ λέγουσιν αὐτῷ ἑπτά.
21 καὶ ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς: οὔπω συνίετε;

22 Καὶ ἔρχονται εἰς Βηθσαϊδάν. καὶ φέρουσιν αὐτῷ τυφλὸν, καὶ παρακαλοῦσιν αὐτὸν ἵνα αὐτοῦ ἅψηται.
23 καὶ ἐπιλαβόμενος τῆς χειρὸς τοῦ τυφλοῦ ἐξήνεγκεν αὐτὸν ἔξω τῆς κώμης, καὶ πτύσας εἰς τὰ ὄμματα αὐτοῦ, ἐπιθεὶς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῷ, ἐπηρώτα αὐτόν, εἴ τι βλέπεις;
24 καὶ ἀναβλέψας ἔλεγεν: βλέπω τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, ὅτι ὡς δένδρα ὁρῶ περιπατοῦντας.
25 εἶτα πάλιν ἐπέθηκεν τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ διέβλεψεν, καὶ ἀπεκατέστη, καὶ ἐνέβλεπεν τηλαυγῶς ἅπαντα.
26 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν εἰς οἶκον αὐτοῦ λέγων: μηδὲ εἰς τὴν κώμην εἰσέλθῃς.

27 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰς κώμας Καισαρείας τῆς Φιλίππου: καὶ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἐπηρώτα τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ λέγων αὐτοῖς: τίνα με λέγουσιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι εἶναι;
28 οἱ δὲ εἶπαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες ὅτι Ἰωάννην τὸν βαπτιστήν, καὶ ἄλλοι, Ἠλίαν, ἄλλοι δὲ ὅτι εἷς τῶν προφητῶν.
29 καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπηρώτα αὐτούς: ὑμεῖς δὲ τίνα με λέγετε εἶναι; ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Πέτρος λέγει αὐτῷ: σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστός.
30 καὶ ἐπετίμησεν αὐτοῖς ἵνα μηδενὶ λέγωσιν περὶ αὐτοῦ.
31 Καὶ ἤρξατο διδάσκειν αὐτοὺς ὅτι δεῖ τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου πολλὰ παθεῖν, καὶ ἀποδοκιμασθῆναι ὑπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων καὶ τῶν ἀρχιερέων καὶ τῶν γραμματέων καὶ ἀποκτανθῆναι καὶ μετὰ τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἀναστῆναι.
32 καὶ παρρησίᾳ τὸν λόγον ἐλάλει. καὶ προσλαβόμενος ὁ Πέτρος αὐτὸν ἤρξατο ἐπιτιμᾶν αὐτῷ.
33 ὁ δὲ ἐπιστραφεὶς καὶ ἰδὼν τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ ἐπετίμησεν Πέτρῳ καὶ λέγει: ὕπαγε ὀπίσω μου, Σατανᾶ, ὅτι οὐ φρονεῖς τὰ τοῦ θεοῦ ἀλλὰ τὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων.
34 Καὶ προσκαλεσάμενος τὸν ὄχλον σὺν τοῖς μαθηταῖς αὐτοῦ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: εἴ τις θέλει ὀπίσω μου ἀκολουθεῖν, ἀπαρνησάσθω ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἀράτω τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀκολουθείτω μοι.
35 ὃς γὰρ ἐὰν θέλῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ σῶσαι, ἀπολέσει αὐτήν: ὃς δ' ἂν ἀπολέσει τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ καὶ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου, σώσει αὐτήν.
36 τί γὰρ ὠφελεῖ ἄνθρωπον κερδῆσαι τὸν κόσμον ὅλον καὶ ζημιωθῆναι τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ;
37 τί γὰρ δοῖ ἄνθρωπος ἀντάλλαγμα τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ;
38 ὃς γὰρ ἐὰν ἐπαισχυνθῇ με καὶ τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους ἐν τῇ γενεᾷ ταύτῃ τῇ μοιχαλίδι καὶ ἁμαρτωλῷ, καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐπαισχυνθήσεται αὐτὸν, ὅταν ἔλθῃ ἐν τῇ δόξῃ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ἀγγέλων τῶν ἁγίων.
