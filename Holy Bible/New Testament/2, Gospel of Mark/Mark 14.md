# Gospel According to Saint Mark 14 (RSVCE)

### The Plot to Kill Jesus
1 It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth, and kill him;
2 for they said, “Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult of the people.”
### The Anointing at Bethany
3 And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the jar and poured it over his head.
4 But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, “Why was the ointment thus wasted?
5 For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor.” And they reproached her.
6 But Jesus said, “Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
7 For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.
8 She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burying.
9 And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”
### Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus
10 Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.
11 And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.
### The Passover with the Disciples
12 And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the passover?”
13 And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him,
14 and wherever he enters, say to the householder, ‘The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?’
15 And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.”
16 And the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover.
17 And when it was evening he came with the twelve.
18 And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.”
19 They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one after another, “Is it I?”
20 He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread in the same dish with me.
21 For the Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”
### The Institution of the Lord’s Supper
22 And as they were eating, he took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, “Take; this is my body.”
23 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it.
24 And he said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
25 Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”
### Peter’s Denial Foretold
26 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
27 And Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away; for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’
28 But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.”
29 Peter said to him, “Even though they all fall away, I will not.”
30 And Jesus said to him, “Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.”
31 But he said vehemently, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And they all said the same.
### Jesus Prays in Gethsemane
32 And they went to a place which was called Gethsemʹane; and he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I pray.”
33 And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled.
34 And he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch.”
35 And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
36 And he said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt.”
37 And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?
38 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
39 And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.
40 And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer him.
41 And he came the third time, and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
42 Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”
### The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus
43 And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
44 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away safely.”
45 And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said, “Master!” And he kissed him.
46 And they laid hands on him and seized him.
47 But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.
48 And Jesus said to them, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?
49 Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.”
50 And they all forsook him, and fled.
51 And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body; and they seized him,
52 but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.
### Jesus before the Council
53 And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.
54 And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, and warming himself at the fire.
55 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none.
56 For many bore false witness against him, and their witness did not agree.
57 And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,
58 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.’ ”
59 Yet not even so did their testimony agree.
60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?”
61 But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”
62 And Jesus said, “I am; and you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.”
63 And the high priest tore his mantle, and said, “Why do we still need witnesses?
64 You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?” And they all condemned him as deserving death.
65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him, saying to him, “Prophesy!” And the guards received him with blows.
### Peter Denies Jesus
66 And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the high priest came;
67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”
68 But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean.” And he went out into the gateway.
69 And the maid saw him, and began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”
70 But again he denied it. And after a little while again the bystanders said to Peter, “Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean.”
71 But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak.”
72 And immediately the cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he broke down and wept.


# Evangelium Secundum Marcum 14 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Erat autem Pascha et azyma post biduum: et quærebant summi sacerdotes et scribæ quomodo eum dolo tenerent, et occiderent.
2 Dicebant autem: Non in die festo, ne forte tumultus fieret in populo.
3 Et cum esset Bethaniæ in domo Simonis leprosi, et recumberet, venit mulier habens alabastrum unguenti nardi spicati pretiosi: et fracto alabastro, effudit super caput ejus.
4 Erant autem quidam indigne ferentes intra semetipsos, et dicentes: Ut quid perditio ista unguenti facta est?
5 poterat enim unguentum istud venundari plus quam trecentis denariis, et dari pauperibus. Et fremebant in eam.
6 Jesus autem dixit: Sinite eam, quid illi molesti estis? Bonum opus operata est in me:
7 semper enim pauperes habetis vobiscum: et cum volueritis, potestis illis benefacere: me autem non semper habetis.
8 Quod habuit hæc, fecit: prævenit ungere corpus meum in sepulturam.
9 Amen dico vobis: Ubicumque prædicatum fuerit Evangelium istud in universo mundo, et quod fecit hæc, narrabitur in memoriam ejus.
10 Et Judas Iscariotes, unus de duodecim, abiit ad summos sacerdotes, ut proderet eum illis.
11 Qui audientes gavisi sunt: et promiserunt ei pecuniam se daturos. Et quærebat quomodo illum opportune traderet.

12 Et primo die azymorum quando Pascha immolabant, dicunt ei discipuli: Quo vis eamus, et paremus tibi ut manduces Pascha?
13 Et mittit duos ex discipulis suis, et dicit eis: Ite in civitatem, et occurret vobis homo lagenam aquæ bajulans: sequimini eum,
14 et quocumque introierit, dicite domino domus, quia magister dicit: Ubi est refectio mea, ubi Pascha cum discipulis meis manducem?
15 Et ipse vobis demonstrabit cœnaculum grande, stratum: et illic parate nobis.
16 Et abierunt discipuli ejus, et venerunt in civitatem: et invenerunt sicut dixerat illis, et paraverunt Pascha.
17 Vespere autem facto, venit cum duodecim.
18 Et discumbentibus eis, et manducantibus, ait Jesus: Amen dico vobis, quia unus ex vobis tradet me, qui manducat mecum.
19 At illi cœperunt contristari, et dicere ei singulatim: Numquid ego?
20 Qui ait illis: Unus ex duodecim, qui intingit mecum manum in catino.
21 Et Filius quidem hominis vadit sicut scriptum est de eo: væ autem homini illi per quem Filius hominis tradetur! bonum erat ei, si non esset natus homo ille.

22 Et manducantibus illis, accepit Jesus panem: et benedicens fregit, et dedit eis, et ait: Sumite, hoc est corpus meum.
23 Et accepto calice, gratias agens dedit eis: et biberunt ex illo omnes.
24 Et ait illis: Hic est sanguis meus novi testamenti, qui pro multis effundetur.
25 Amen dico vobis, quia jam non bibam de hoc genimine vitis usque in diem illum, cum illud bibam novum in regno Dei.
26 Et hymno dicto exierunt in montem Olivarum.
27 Et ait eis Jesus: Omnes scandalizabimini in me in nocte ista: quia scriptum est: Percutiam pastorem, et dispergentur oves.
28 Sed postquam resurrexero, præcedam vos in Galilæam.
29 Petrus autem ait illi: Et si omnes scandalizati fuerint in te, sed non ego.
30 Et ait illi Jesus: Amen dico tibi, quia tu hodie in nocte hac, priusquam gallus vocem bis dederit, ter me es negaturus.
31 At ille amplius loquebatur: Et si oportuerit me simul commori tibi, non te negabo. Similiter autem et omnes dicebant.

32 Et veniunt in prædium, cui nomen Gethsemani. Et ait discipulis suis: Sedete hic donec orem.
33 Et assumit Petrum, et Jacobum, et Joannem secum: et cœpit pavere et tædere.
34 Et ait illis: Tristis est anima mea usque ad mortem: sustinete hic, et vigilate.
35 Et cum processisset paululum, procidit super terram, et orabat ut, si fieri posset, transiret ab eo hora.
36 Et dixit: Abba pater, omnia tibi possibilia sunt: transfer calicem hunc a me: sed non quod ego volo, sed quod tu.
37 Et venit, et invenit eos dormientes. Et ait Petro: Simon, dormis? non potuisti una hora vigilare?
38 vigilate et orate, ut non intretis in tentationem. Spiritus quidem promptus est, caro vero infirma.
39 Et iterum abiens oravit, eumdem sermonem dicens.
40 Et reversus, denuo invenit eos dormientes (erant enim oculi eorum gravati), et ignorabant quid responderent ei.
41 Et venit tertio, et ait illis: Dormite jam, et requiescite. Sufficit: venit hora: ecce Filius hominis tradetur in manus peccatorum.
42 Surgite, eamus: ecce qui me tradet, prope est.

43 Et, adhuc eo loquente, venit Judas Iscariotes unus de duodecim, et cum eo turba multa cum gladiis et lignis, a summis sacerdotibus, et scribis, et senioribus.
44 Dederat autem traditor ejus signum eis, dicens: Quemcumque osculatus fuero, ipse est, tenete eum, et ducite caute.
45 Et cum venisset, statim accedens ad eum, ait: Ave Rabbi: et osculatus est eum.
46 At illi manus injecerunt in eum, et tenuerunt eum.
47 Unus autem quidam de circumstantibus educens gladium, percussit servum summi sacerdotis, et amputavit illi auriculam.
48 Et respondens Jesus, ait illis: Tamquam ad latronem existis cum gladiis et lignis comprehendere me?
49 quotidie eram apud vos in templo docens, et non me tenuistis. Sed ut impleantur Scripturæ.
50 Tunc discipuli ejus relinquentes eum, omnes fugerunt.
51 Adolescens autem quidam sequebatur eum amictus sindone super nudo: et tenuerunt eum.
52 At ille rejecta sindone, nudus profugit ab eis.
53 Et adduxerunt Jesum ad summum sacerdotem: et convenerunt omnes sacerdotes, et scribæ, et seniores.

54 Petrus autem a longe secutus est eum usque intro in atrium summi sacerdotis: et sedebat cum ministris ad ignem, et calefaciebat se.
55 Summi vero sacerdotes et omne concilium quærebant adversus Jesum testimonium ut eum morti traderent: nec inveniebant.
56 Multi enim testimonium falsum dicebant adversus eum: et convenientia testimonia non erant.
57 Et quidam surgentes, falsum testimonium ferebant adversus eum, dicentes:
58 Quoniam nos audivimus eum dicentem: Ego dissolvam templum hoc manu factum, et per triduum aliud non manu factum ædificabo.
59 Et non erat conveniens testimonium illorum.
60 Et exsurgens summus sacerdos in medium, interrogavit Jesum, dicens: Non respondes quidquam ad ea quæ tibi objiciuntur ab his?
61 Ille autem tacebat, et nihil respondit. Rursum summus sacerdos interrogabat eum, et dixit ei: Tu es Christus Filius Dei benedicti?
62 Jesus autem dixit illi: Ego sum: et videbitis Filium hominis sedentem a dextris virtutis Dei, et venientem cum nubibus cæli.
63 Summus autem sacerdos scindens vestimenta sua, ait: Quid adhuc desideramus testes?
64 Audistis blasphemiam: quid vobis videtur? Qui omnes condemnaverunt eum esse reum mortis.
65 Et cœperunt quidam conspuere eum, et velare faciem ejus, et colaphis eum cædere, et dicere ei: Prophetiza: et ministri alapis eum cædebant.

66 Et cum esset Petrus in atrio deorsum, venit una ex ancillis summi sacerdotis:
67 et cum vidisset Petrum calefacientem se, aspiciens illum, ait: Et tu cum Jesu Nazareno eras.
68 At ille negavit, dicens: Neque scio, neque novi quid dicas. Et exiit foras ante atrium, et gallus cantavit.
69 Rursus autem cum vidisset illum ancilla, cœpit dicere circumstantibus: Quia hic ex illis est.
70 At ille iterum negavit. Et post pusillum rursus qui astabant, dicebant Petro: Vere ex illis es: nam et Galilæus es.
71 Ille autem cœpit anathematizare et jurare: Quia nescio hominem istum, quem dicitis.
72 Et statim gallus iterum cantavit. Et recordatus est Petrus verbi quod dixerat ei Jesus: Priusquam gallus cantet bis, ter me negabis. Et cœpit flere.


# Κατὰ Μᾶρκον 14 (Textus Receptus)

1 Ἦν δὲ τὸ πάσχα καὶ τὰ ἄζυμα μετὰ δύο ἡμέρας, καὶ ἐζήτουν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς πῶς αὐτὸν ἐν δόλῳ κρατήσαντες ἀποκτείνωσιν:
2 ἔλεγον γάρ: μὴ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ, μήποτε ἔσται θόρυβος τοῦ λαοῦ.
3 Καὶ ὄντος αὐτοῦ ἐν Βηθανίᾳ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ Σίμωνος τοῦ λεπροῦ, κατακειμένου αὐτοῦ ἦλθεν γυνὴ ἔχουσα ἀλάβαστρον μύρου νάρδου πιστικῆς πολυτελοῦς: συντρίψασα τὴν ἀλάβαστρον κατέχεεν αὐτοῦ τῆς κεφαλῆς.
4 ἦσαν δέ τινες ἀγανακτοῦντες πρὸς ἑαυτούς: εἰς τί ἡ ἀπώλεια αὕτη τοῦ μύρου γέγονεν;
5 ἠδύνατο γὰρ τοῦτο τὸ μύρον πραθῆναι ἐπάνω δηναρίων τριακοσίων καὶ δοθῆναι τοῖς πτωχοῖς: καὶ ἐνεβριμῶντο αὐτῇ.
6 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν: ἄφετε αὐτήν: τί αὐτῇ κόπους παρέχετε; καλὸν ἔργον ἠργάσατο ἐν ἐμοί.
7 πάντοτε γὰρ τοὺς πτωχοὺς ἔχετε μεθ' ἑαυτῶν, καὶ ὅταν θέλητε δύνασθε αὐτοῖς εὖ ποιῆσαι, ἐμὲ δὲ οὐ πάντοτε ἔχετε.
8 ὃ ἔσχεν ἐποίησεν: προέλαβεν μυρίσαι τὸ σῶμά μου εἰς τὸν ἐνταφιασμόν.
9 ἀμὴν δὲ λέγω ὑμῖν, ὅπου ἐὰν κηρυχθῇ τὸ εὐαγγέλιον εἰς ὅλον τὸν κόσμον, καὶ ὃ ἐποίησεν αὕτη λαληθήσεται εἰς μνημόσυνον αὐτῆς.
10 Καὶ Ἰούδας Ἰσκαριὼθ, ὁ εἷς τῶν δώδεκα, ἀπῆλθεν πρὸς τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς ἵνα αὐτὸν παραδοῖ αὐτοῖς.
11 οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες ἐχάρησαν καὶ ἐπηγγείλαντο αὐτῷ ἀργύριον δοῦναι: καὶ ἐζήτει πῶς αὐτὸν εὐκαίρως παραδοῖ.

12 Καὶ τῇ πρώτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν ἀζύμων, ὅτε τὸ πάσχα ἔθυον, λέγουσιν αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ: ποῦ θέλεις ἀπελθόντες ἑτοιμάσωμεν ἵνα φάγῃς τὸ πάσχα;
13 καὶ ἀποστέλλει δύο τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς: ὑπάγετε εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἀπαντήσει ὑμῖν ἄνθρωπος κεράμιον ὕδατος βαστάζων: ἀκολουθήσατε αὐτῷ,
14 καὶ ὅπου ἐὰν εἰσέλθῃ εἴπατε τῷ οἰκοδεσπότῃ ὅτι ὁ διδάσκαλος λέγει: ποῦ ἐστιν τὸ κατάλυμά μου, ὅπου τὸ πάσχα μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν μου φάγω;
15 καὶ αὐτὸς ὑμῖν δείξει ἀνάγαιον μέγα ἐστρωμένον ἕτοιμον, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἑτοιμάσατε ἡμῖν.
16 καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ μαθηταὶ καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εὗρον καθὼς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἡτοίμασαν τὸ πάσχα.
17 Καὶ ὀψίας γενομένης ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν δώδεκα.
18 καὶ ἀνακειμένων αὐτῶν καὶ ἐσθιόντων ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν: ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι εἷς ἐξ ὑμῶν παραδώσει με, ὁ ἐσθίων μετ' ἐμοῦ.
19 ἤρξαντο λυπεῖσθαι καὶ λέγειν αὐτῷ εἷς κατὰ εἷς: μήτι ἐγώ;
20 ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: εἷς τῶν δώδεκα, ὁ ἐμβαπτόμενος μετ' ἐμοῦ εἰς τὸ τρύβλιον.
21 ὅτι ὁ μὲν υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὑπάγει, καθὼς γέγραπται περὶ αὐτοῦ: οὐαὶ δὲ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐκείνῳ δι' οὗ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου παραδίδοται: καλὸν αὐτῷ εἰ οὐκ ἐγεννήθη ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος.

22 Καὶ ἐσθιόντων αὐτῶν λαβὼν ἄρτον εὐλογήσας ἔκλασεν καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς καὶ εἶπεν: λάβετε: τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ σῶμά μου.
23 καὶ λαβὼν ποτήριον εὐχαριστήσας ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἔπιον ἐξ αὐτοῦ πάντες.
24 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ αἷμά μου τῆς διαθήκης τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον ὑπὲρ πολλῶν.
25 ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ πίω ἐκ τοῦ γενήματος τῆς ἀμπέλου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης ὅταν αὐτὸ πίνω καινὸν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ.
26 Καὶ ὑμνήσαντες ἐξῆλθον εἰς τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαιῶν.
27 καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς ὅτι πάντες σκανδαλισθήσεσθε, ὅτι γέγραπται: πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα, καὶ τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται.
28 ἀλλὰ μετὰ τὸ ἐγερθῆναί με προάξω ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν.
29 ὁ δὲ Πέτρος ἔφη αὐτῷ: εἰ καὶ πάντες σκανδαλισθήσονται, ἀλλ' οὐκ ἐγώ.
30 καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς: ἀμὴν λέγω σοι ὅτι σὺ σήμερον ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ πρὶν ἢ δὶς ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι τρίς με ἀπαρνήσῃ.
31 ὁ δὲ ἐκπερισσῶς ἐλάλει: ἐὰν δέῃ με συναποθανεῖν σοι, οὐ μή σε ἀπαρνήσομαι. ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ πάντες ἔλεγον.

32 Καὶ ἔρχονται εἰς χωρίον οὗ τὸ ὄνομα Γεθσημανί, καὶ λέγει τοῖς μαθηταῖς αὐτοῦ: καθίσατε ὧδε ἕως προσεύξωμαι.
33 καὶ παραλαμβάνει τὸν Πέτρον καὶ τὸν Ἰάκωβον καὶ τὸν Ἰωάννην μετ' αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἤρξατο ἐκθαμβεῖσθαι καὶ ἀδημονεῖν,
34 καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς: περίλυπός ἐστιν ἡ ψυχή μου ἕως θανάτου: μείνατε ὧδε καὶ γρηγορεῖτε.
35 καὶ προελθὼν μικρὸν ἔπιπτεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ προσηύχετο ἵνα εἰ δυνατόν ἐστιν παρέλθῃ ἀπ' αὐτοῦ ἡ ὥρα,
36 καὶ ἔλεγεν: Αββα ὁ πατήρ, πάντα δυνατά σοι: παρένεγκε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο ἀπ' ἐμοῦ: ἀλλ' οὐ τί ἐγὼ θέλω ἀλλὰ τί σύ.
37 καὶ ἔρχεται καὶ εὑρίσκει αὐτοὺς καθεύδοντας, καὶ λέγει τῷ Πέτρῳ: Σίμων, καθεύδεις; οὐκ ἴσχυσας μίαν ὥραν γρηγορῆσαι;
38 γρηγορεῖτε καὶ προσεύχεσθε, ἵνα μὴ ἔλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν. τὸ μὲν πνεῦμα πρόθυμον, ἡ δὲ σὰρξ ἀσθενής.
39 καὶ πάλιν ἀπελθὼν προσηύξατο τὸν αὐτὸν λόγον εἰπών.
40 καὶ πάλιν ἐλθὼν εὗρεν αὐτοὺς καθεύδοντας: ἦσαν γὰρ αὐτῶν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ καταβαρυνόμενοι, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν τί ἀποκριθῶσιν αὐτῷ.
41 καὶ ἔρχεται τὸ τρίτον καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς: καθεύδετε τὸ λοιπὸν καὶ ἀναπαύεσθε: ἀπέχει: ἦλθεν ἡ ὥρα, ἰδοὺ παραδίδοται ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου εἰς τὰς χεῖρας τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν.
42 ἐγείρεσθε ἄγωμεν: ἰδοὺ ὁ παραδιδούς με ἤγγικεν.

43 Καὶ εὐθὺς ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος παραγίνεται Ἰούδας εἷς τῶν δώδεκα, καὶ μετ' αὐτοῦ ὄχλος μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων παρὰ τῶν ἀρχιερέων καὶ τῶν γραμματέων καὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων.
44 δεδώκει δὲ ὁ παραδιδοὺς αὐτὸν σύσσημον αὐτοῖς λέγων: ὃν ἂν φιλήσω, αὐτός ἐστιν: κρατήσατε αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπάγετε ἀσφαλῶς.
45 καὶ ἐλθὼν εὐθὺς προσελθὼν αὐτῷ λέγει: ῥαββί, καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτόν:
46 οἱ δὲ ἐπέβαλον τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῷ καὶ ἐκράτησαν αὐτόν.
47 εἷς δέ τις τῶν παρεστηκότων σπασάμενος τὴν μάχαιραν ἔπαισεν τὸν δοῦλον τοῦ ἀρχιερέως καὶ ἀφεῖλεν αὐτοῦ τὸ ὠτάριον.
48 καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς: ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθατε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων συλλαβεῖν με:
49 καθ' ἡμέραν ἤμην πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ διδάσκων, καὶ οὐκ ἐκρατήσατέ με: ἀλλ' ἵνα πληρωθῶσιν αἱ γραφαί.
50 καὶ ἀφέντες αὐτὸν ἔφυγον πάντες.
51 Καὶ νεανίσκος τις συνηκολούθει αὐτῷ περιβεβλημένος σινδόνα ἐπὶ γυμνοῦ, καὶ κρατοῦσιν αὐτόν:
52 ὁ δὲ καταλιπὼν τὴν σινδόνα γυμνὸς ἔφυγεν.
53 Καὶ ἀπήγαγον τὸν Ἰησοῦν πρὸς τὸν ἀρχιερέα, καὶ συνέρχονται πάντες οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς.

54 καὶ ὁ Πέτρος ἀπὸ μακρόθεν ἠκολούθησεν αὐτῷ ἕως ἔσω εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τοῦ ἀρχιερέως, καὶ ἦν συγκαθήμενος μετὰ τῶν ὑπηρετῶν καὶ θερμαινόμενος πρὸς τὸ φῶς.
55 Οἱ δὲ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ ὅλον τὸ συνέδριον ἐζήτουν κατὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ μαρτυρίαν εἰς τὸ θανατῶσαι αὐτόν, καὶ οὐχ ηὕρισκον:
56 πολλοὶ γὰρ ἐψευδομαρτύρουν κατ' αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἴσαι αἱ μαρτυρίαι οὐκ ἦσαν.
57 καί τινες ἀναστάντες ἐψευδομαρτύρουν κατ' αὐτοῦ λέγοντες
58 ὅτι ἡμεῖς ἠκούσαμεν αὐτοῦ λέγοντος ὅτι ἐγὼ καταλύσω τὸν ναὸν τοῦτον τὸν χειροποίητον καὶ διὰ τριῶν ἡμερῶν ἄλλον ἀχειροποίητον οἰκοδομήσω.
59 καὶ οὐδὲ οὕτως ἴση ἦν ἡ μαρτυρία αὐτῶν.
60 καὶ ἀναστὰς ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς εἰς μέσον ἐπηρώτησεν τὸν Ἰησοῦν λέγων: οὐκ ἀποκρίνῃ οὐδέν τί οὗτοί σου καταμαρτυροῦσιν;
61 ὁ δὲ ἐσιώπα καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίνατο οὐδέν. πάλιν ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς ἐπηρώτα αὐτὸν καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ εὐλογητοῦ;
62 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν: ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ ὄψεσθε τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐκ δεξιῶν καθήμενον τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ ἐρχόμενον μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ.
63 ὁ δὲ ἀρχιερεὺς διαρρήξας τοὺς χιτῶνας αὐτοῦ λέγει: τί ἔτι χρείαν ἔχομεν μαρτύρων;
64 ἠκούσατε τῆς βλασφημίας: τί ὑμῖν φαίνεται; οἱ δὲ πάντες κατέκριναν αὐτὸν ἔνοχον εἶναι θανάτου.
65 Καὶ ἤρξαντό τινες ἐμπτύειν αὐτῷ καὶ περικαλύπτειν αὐτοῦ τὸ πρόσωπον καὶ κολαφίζειν αὐτὸν καὶ λέγειν αὐτῷ: προφήτευσον, καὶ οἱ ὑπηρέται ῥαπίσμασιν αὐτὸν ἔλαβον.

66 Καὶ ὄντος τοῦ Πέτρου κάτω ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ ἔρχεται μία τῶν παιδισκῶν τοῦ ἀρχιερέως,
67 καὶ ἰδοῦσα τὸν Πέτρον θερμαινόμενον ἐμβλέψασα αὐτῷ λέγει: καὶ σὺ μετὰ τοῦ Ναζαρηνοῦ ἦσθα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ.
68 ὁ δὲ ἠρνήσατο λέγων: οὔτε οἶδα οὔτε ἐπίσταμαι σὺ τί λέγεις. καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἔξω εἰς τὸ προαύλιον, καὶ ἀλέκτωρ ἐφώνησεν.
69 καὶ ἡ παιδίσκη ἰδοῦσα αὐτὸν ἤρξατο πάλιν λέγειν τοῖς παρεστῶσιν ὅτι οὗτος ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐστιν.
70 ὁ δὲ πάλιν ἠρνεῖτο. καὶ μετὰ μικρὸν πάλιν οἱ παρεστῶτες ἔλεγον τῷ Πέτρῳ: ἀληθῶς ἐξ αὐτῶν εἶ: καὶ γὰρ Γαλιλαῖος εἶ.
71 ὁ δὲ ἤρξατο ἀναθεματίζειν καὶ ὀμνύναι ὅτι οὐκ οἶδα τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦτον ὃν λέγετε.
72 καὶ εὐθὺς ἐκ δευτέρου ἀλέκτωρ ἐφώνησεν. καὶ ἀνεμνήσθη ὁ Πέτρος τὸ ῥῆμα ὡς εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ὅτι πρὶν ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι δὶς τρίς με ἀπαρνήσῃ. καὶ ἐπιβαλὼν ἔκλαιεν.
