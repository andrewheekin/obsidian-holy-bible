# Gospel According to Saint Mark 15 (RSVCE)

### Jesus before Pilate
1 And as soon as it was morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council held a consultation; and they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him to Pilate.
2 And Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, “You have said so.”
3 And the chief priests accused him of many things.
4 And Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.”
5 But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate wondered.
### Pilate Hands Jesus over to Be Crucified
6 Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner whom they asked.
7 And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabʹbas.
8 And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he was wont to do for them.
9 And he answered them, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?”
10 For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.
11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabʹbas instead.
12 And Pilate again said to them, “Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?”
13 And they cried out again, “Crucify him.”
14 And Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him.”
15 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabʹbas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
### The Soldiers Mock Jesus
16 And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the praetorium); and they called together the whole battalion.
17 And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on him.
18 And they began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
19 And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him.
20 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.
### The Crucifixion of Jesus
21 And they compelled a passer-by, Simon of Cyreʹne, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
22 And they brought him to the place called Golʹgotha (which means the place of a skull).
23 And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it.
24 And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.
25 And it was the third hour, when they crucified him.
26 And the inscription of the charge against him read, “The King of the Jews.”
27 And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.
29 And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,
30 save yourself, and come down from the cross!”
31 So also the chief priests mocked him to one another with the scribes, saying, “He saved others; he cannot save himself.
32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.
### The Death of Jesus
33 And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eʹlo-i, Eʹlo-i, laʹma sabach-thaʹni?” which means, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”
35 And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “Behold, he is calling Eliʹjah.”
36 And one ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see whether Eliʹjah will come to take him down.”
37 And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last.
38 And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
39 And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that he thus breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
40 There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magʹdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Saloʹme,
41 who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
### The Burial of Jesus
42 And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
43 Joseph of Arimatheʹa, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
44 And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
45 And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.
46 And he bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
47 Mary Magʹdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.


# Evangelium Secundum Marcum 15 (Latin Vulgate)

1 Et confestim mane consilium facientes summi sacerdotes cum senioribus, et scribis, et universo concilio, vincientes Jesum, duxerunt, et tradiderunt Pilato.
2 Et interrogavit eum Pilatus: Tu es rex Judæorum? At ille respondens, ait illi: Tu dicis.
3 Et accusabant eum summi sacerdotes in multis.
4 Pilatus autem rursum interrogavit eum, dicens: Non respondes quidquam? vide in quantis te accusant.
5 Jesus autem amplius nihil respondit, ita ut miraretur Pilatus.
6 Per diem autem festum solebat dimittere illis unum ex vinctis, quemcumque petissent.
7 Erat autem qui dicebatur Barrabas, qui cum seditiosis erat vinctus, qui in seditione fecerat homicidium.
8 Et cum ascendisset turba, cœpit rogare, sicut semper faciebat illis.
9 Pilatus autem respondit eis, et dixit: Vultis dimittam vobis regem Judæorum?
10 Sciebat enim quod per invidiam tradidissent eum summi sacerdotes.
11 Pontifices autem concitaverunt turbam, ut magis Barabbam dimitteret eis.
12 Pilatus autem iterum respondens, ait illis: Quid ergo vultis faciam regi Judæorum?
13 At illi iterum clamaverunt: Crucifige eum.
14 Pilatus vero dicebat illis: Quid enim mali fecit? At illi magis clamabant: Crucifige eum.
15 Pilatus autem volens populo satisfacere, dimisit illis Barabbam, et tradidit Jesum flagellis cæsum, ut crucifigeretur.

16 Milites autem duxerunt eum in atrium prætorii, et convocant totam cohortem,
17 et induunt eum purpura, et imponunt ei plectentes spineam coronam.
18 Et cœperunt salutare eum: Ave rex Judæorum.
19 Et percutiebant caput ejus arundine: et conspuebant eum, et ponentes genua, adorabant eum.
20 Et postquam illuserunt ei, exuerunt illum purpura, et induerunt eum vestimentis suis: et educunt illum ut crucifigerent eum.
21 Et angariaverunt prætereuntem quempiam, Simonem Cyrenæum venientem de villa, patrem Alexandri et Rufi, ut tolleret crucem ejus.
22 Et perducunt illum in Golgotha locum: quod est interpretatum Calvariæ locus.
23 Et dabant ei bibere myrrhatum vinum: et non accepit.
24 Et crucifigentes eum, diviserunt vestimenta ejus, mittentes sortem super eis, quis quid tolleret.

25 Erat autem hora tertia: et crucifixerunt eum.
26 Et erat titulus causæ ejus inscriptus: Rex Judæorum.
27 Et cum eo crucifigunt duos latrones: unum a dextris, et alium a sinistris ejus.
28 Et impleta est Scriptura, quæ dicit: Et cum iniquis reputatus est.
29 Et prætereuntes blasphemabant eum, moventes capita sua, et dicentes: Vah! qui destruis templum Dei, et in tribus diebus reædificas,
30 salvum fac temetipsum descendens de cruce.
31 Similiter et summi sacerdotes illudentes, ad alterutrum cum scribis dicebant: Alios salvos fecit; seipsum non potest salvum facere.
32 Christus rex Israël descendat nunc de cruce, ut videamus, et credamus. Et qui cum eo crucifixi erant, convitiabantur ei.

33 Et facta hora sexta, tenebræ factæ sunt per totam terram usque in horam nonam.
34 Et hora nona exclamavit Jesus voce magna, dicens: Eloi, eloi, lamma sabacthani? quod est interpretatum: Deus meus, Deus meus, ut quid dereliquisti me?
35 Et quidam de circumstantibus audientes, dicebant: Ecce Eliam vocat.
36 Currens autem unus, et implens spongiam aceto, circumponensque calamo, potum dabat ei, dicens: Sinite, videamus si veniat Elias ad deponendum eum.
37 Jesus autem emissa voce magna expiravit.
38 Et velum templi scissum est in duo, a summo usque deorsum.
39 Videns autem centurio, qui ex adverso stabat, quia sic clamans expirasset, ait: Vere hic homo Filius Dei erat.

40 Erant autem et mulieres de longe aspicientes: inter quas erat Maria Magdalene, et Maria Jacobi minoris, et Joseph mater, et Salome:
41 et cum esset in Galilæa, sequebantur eum, et ministrabant ei, et aliæ multæ, quæ simul cum eo ascenderant Jerosolymam.
42 Et cum jam sero esset factum (quia erat parasceve, quod est ante sabbatum),
43 venit Joseph ab Arimathæa nobilis decurio, qui et ipse erat exspectans regnum Dei, et audacter introivit ad Pilatum, et petiit corpus Jesu.
44 Pilatus autem mirabatur si jam obiisset. Et accersito centurione, interrogavit eum si jam mortuus esset.
45 Et cum cognovisset a centurione, donavit corpus Joseph.
46 Joseph autem mercatus sindonem, et deponens eum involvit sindone, et posuit eum in monumento quod erat excisum de petra, et advolvit lapidem ad ostium monumenti.
47 Maria autem Magdalene et Maria Joseph aspiciebant ubi poneretur.


# Κατὰ Μᾶρκον 15 (Textus Receptus)

1 Καὶ εὐθὺς πρωῒ συμβούλιον ποιήσαντες οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς μετὰ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων καὶ γραμματέων καὶ ὅλον τὸ συνέδριον, δήσαντες τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἀπήνεγκαν καὶ παρέδωκαν Πιλάτῳ.
2 καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτὸν ὁ Πιλᾶτος: σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων; ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτῷ λέγει: σὺ λέγεις.
3 καὶ κατηγόρουν αὐτοῦ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς πολλά.
4 ὁ δὲ Πιλᾶτος πάλιν ἐπηρώτα αὐτὸν: λέγων οὐκ ἀποκρίνῃ οὐδέν; ἴδε πόσα σου κατηγοροῦσιν.
5 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς οὐκέτι οὐδὲν ἀπεκρίθη, ὥστε θαυμάζειν τὸν Πιλᾶτον.
6 Κατὰ δὲ ἑορτὴν ἀπέλυεν αὐτοῖς ἕνα δέσμιον ὃν παρῃτοῦντο.
7 ἦν δὲ ὁ λεγόμενος Βαραββᾶς μετὰ τῶν στασιαστῶν δεδεμένος, οἵτινες ἐν τῇ στάσει φόνον πεποιήκεισαν.
8 καὶ ἀναβὰς ὁ ὄχλος ἤρξατο αἰτεῖσθαι καθὼς ἐποίει αὐτοῖς.
9 ὁ δὲ Πιλᾶτος ἀπεκρίθη αὐτοῖς λέγων: θέλετε ἀπολύσω ὑμῖν τὸν βασιλέα τῶν Ἰουδαίων;
10 ἐγίνωσκεν γὰρ ὅτι διὰ φθόνον παραδεδώκεισαν αὐτὸν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς.
11 οἱ δὲ ἀρχιερεῖς ἀνέσεισαν τὸν ὄχλον ἵνα μᾶλλον τὸν Βαραββᾶν ἀπολύσῃ αὐτοῖς.
12 ὁ δὲ Πιλᾶτος πάλιν ἀποκριθεὶς ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς: τί οὖν θέλετε ποιήσω ὃν λέγετε τὸν βασιλέα τῶν Ἰουδαίων;
13 οἱ δὲ πάλιν ἔκραξαν: σταύρωσον αὐτόν.
14 ὁ δὲ Πιλᾶτος ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς: τί γὰρ ἐποίησεν κακόν; οἱ δὲ περισσῶς ἔκραξαν: σταύρωσον αὐτόν.
15 ὁ δὲ Πιλᾶτος βουλόμενος τῷ ὄχλῳ τὸ ἱκανὸν ποιῆσαι ἀπέλυσεν αὐτοῖς τὸν Βαραββᾶν, καὶ παρέδωκεν τὸν Ἰησοῦν φραγελλώσας ἵνα σταυρωθῇ.

16 Οἱ δὲ στρατιῶται ἀπήγαγον αὐτὸν ἔσω τῆς αὐλῆς, ὅ ἐστιν πραιτώριον, καὶ συγκαλοῦσιν ὅλην τὴν σπεῖραν:
17 καὶ ἐνδιδύσκουσιν αὐτὸν πορφύραν καὶ περιτιθέασιν αὐτῷ πλέξαντες ἀκάνθινον στέφανον:
18 καὶ ἤρξαντο ἀσπάζεσθαι αὐτόν: χαῖρε, βασιλεῦ τῶν Ἰουδαίων:
19 καὶ ἔτυπτον αὐτοῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν καλάμῳ καὶ ἐνέπτυον αὐτῷ, καὶ τιθέντες τὰ γόνατα προσεκύνουν αὐτῷ.
20 καὶ ὅτε ἐνέπαιξαν αὐτῷ, ἐξέδυσαν αὐτὸν τὴν πορφύραν καὶ ἐνέδυσαν αὐτὸν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξάγουσιν αὐτὸν ἵνα σταυρώσωσιν. αὐτόν
21 καὶ ἀγγαρεύουσιν παράγοντά τινα Σίμωνα Κυρηναῖον, ἐρχόμενον ἀπ' ἀγροῦ, τὸν πατέρα Ἀλεξάνδρου καὶ Ῥούφου, ἵνα ἄρῃ τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ.
22 καὶ φέρουσιν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν Γολγοθᾶν τόπον, ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον κρανίου τόπος.
23 καὶ ἐδίδουν αὐτῷ ἐσμυρνισμένον οἶνον: ὃς δὲ οὐκ ἔλαβεν.
24 καὶ σταυροῦσιν αὐτὸν, καὶ διαμερίζονται τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, βάλλοντες κλῆρον ἐπ' αὐτὰ τίς τί ἄρῃ.

25 ἦν δὲ ὥρα τρίτη καὶ ἐσταύρωσαν αὐτόν.
26 καὶ ἦν ἡ ἐπιγραφὴ τῆς αἰτίας αὐτοῦ ἐπιγεγραμμένη: ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων.
27 Καὶ σὺν αὐτῷ σταυροῦσιν δύο λῃστάς, ἕνα ἐκ δεξιῶν καὶ ἕνα ἐξ εὐωνύμων αὐτοῦ.
28 
29 καὶ οἱ παραπορευόμενοι ἐβλασφήμουν αὐτὸν κινοῦντες τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν καὶ λέγοντες: οὐὰ ὁ καταλύων τὸν ναὸν καὶ οἰκοδομῶν ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις,
30 σῶσον σεαυτὸν καταβὰς ἀπὸ τοῦ σταυροῦ.
31 ὁμοίως καὶ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς ἐμπαίζοντες πρὸς ἀλλήλους μετὰ τῶν γραμματέων ἔλεγον: ἄλλους ἔσωσεν, ἑαυτὸν οὐ δύναται σῶσαι:
32 ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ καταβάτω νῦν ἀπὸ τοῦ σταυροῦ, ἵνα ἴδωμεν καὶ πιστεύσωμεν. καὶ οἱ συνεσταυρωμένοι σὺν αὐτῷ ὠνείδιζον αὐτόν.

33 Καὶ γενομένης ὥρας ἕκτης σκότος ἐγένετο ἐφ' ὅλην τὴν γῆν ἕως ὥρας ἐνάτης.
34 καὶ τῇ ἐνάτῃ ὥρᾳ ἐβόησεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς φωνῇ μεγάλῃ: ελωι ελωι λεμα σαβαχθανι ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον: ὁ θεός μου ὁ θεός μου, εἰς τί ἐγκατέλιπές με;
35 καί τινες τῶν παρεστηκότων ἀκούσαντες ἔλεγον: ἴδε Ἠλίαν φωνεῖ.
36 δραμὼν δέ τις καὶ γεμίσας σπόγγον ὄξους περιθεὶς καλάμῳ ἐπότιζεν αὐτόν, λέγων: ἄφετε ἴδωμεν εἰ ἔρχεται Ἠλίας καθελεῖν αὐτόν.
37 ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς ἀφεὶς φωνὴν μεγάλην ἐξέπνευσεν.
38 καὶ τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ ναοῦ ἐσχίσθη εἰς δύο ἀπ' ἄνωθεν ἕως κάτω.
39 ἰδὼν δὲ ὁ κεντυρίων ὁ παρεστηκὼς ἐξ ἐναντίας αὐτοῦ ὅτι οὕτως ἐξέπνευσεν εἶπεν: ἀληθῶς οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος υἱὸς θεοῦ ἦν

40 Ἦσαν δὲ καὶ γυναῖκες ἀπὸ μακρόθεν θεωροῦσαι, ἐν αἷς καὶ Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ καὶ Μαρία ἡ Ἰακώβου τοῦ μικροῦ καὶ Ἰωσῆτος μήτηρ καὶ Σαλώμη,
41 αἳ ὅτε ἦν ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ ἠκολούθουν αὐτῷ καὶ διηκόνουν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἄλλαι πολλαὶ αἱ συναναβᾶσαι αὐτῷ εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα.
42 Καὶ ἤδη ὀψίας γενομένης, ἐπεὶ ἦν παρασκευή, ὅ ἐστιν προσάββατον,
43 ἐλθὼν Ἰωσὴφ ὁ] ἀπὸ Ἁριμαθαίας εὐσχήμων βουλευτής, ὃς καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν προσδεχόμενος τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ, τολμήσας εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς τὸν Πιλᾶτον καὶ ᾐτήσατο τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ.
44 ὁ δὲ Πιλᾶτος ἐθαύμασεν εἰ ἤδη τέθνηκεν, καὶ προσκαλεσάμενος τὸν κεντυρίωνα ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτὸν εἰ πάλαι ἀπέθανεν:
45 καὶ γνοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ κεντυρίωνος ἐδωρήσατο τὸ πτῶμα τῷ Ἰωσήφ.
46 καὶ ἀγοράσας σινδόνα, καθελὼν αὐτὸν ἐνείλησεν τῇ σινδόνι καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὸν ἐν μνημείῳ ὃ ἦν λελατομημένον ἐκ πέτρας, καὶ προσεκύλισεν λίθον ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τοῦ μνημείου.
47 ἡ δὲ Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ καὶ Μαρία ἡ Ἰωσῆτος ἐθεώρουν ποῦ τέθειται.
